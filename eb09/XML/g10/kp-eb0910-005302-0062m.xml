                <p><label type="entry">GALVESTON</label>, a city and port of entry on the coast of
                    Texas, United States of North America, situated about 340 miles to the westward
                    of the mouth of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, on the south side of
                    the entrance into Galveston Bay, in 29° 18' N. lat. and 94’ 47' long, west from
                    Greenwich. It is the principal port and the largest city in the State, is the
                    seat of justice of Galveston County, and is located on the inner shore of
                    Galveston Island, about 2 miles from its most north-easterly point, known as
                    Fort Point. The city therefore faces the main Texas shore, being separated from
                    it by West Bay, lying between the island and the mainland. The principal portion
                    of the county lie3 on the mainland fronting the two bays above named, its
                    general surface, like that of the island, being low and level, and the soil
                    sandy.</p>
                <p>Galveston Island is a low sandy island, about 28 miles long and 1∣ to miles wide,
                    stretching along the coast of Texas in a north-easterly and south-westerly
                    direction, and forming the gulf coast-line throughout its entire length.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n63/mode/1up"

                <p>Its surface, which has an average height of 4 to 5 feet above tide level, is
                    diversified by a number of freshwater ponds aud intersected by several creeks
                    and small bayous. The beach, on the Gulf side, furnishes a smooth aud pleasant
                    drive during low-water stage, and excellent surf-bathing at all times. To the
                    northward of the entrance into the harbour, the coast-line is continued in the
                    same general direction to the north-east by Bolivar Peninsula, a low, narrow
                    sand-strip of the mainland, the width of the throat of the harbour between Fort
                    Point and Bolivar Point being about 2 miles. There is a lighthouse on Bolivar
                    Point.</p>
                <p>Galveston Harbour is the finest in the State; and the bay of the same name,
                    including certain outlying portions of it known severally as East Bay, West Bay,
                    and Turtle Bay, covers an area of upwards of 450 square miles of tidal water. At
                    the head of the bay, about 35 miles from the city in a northerly direction, it
                    receives Trinity River, its largest tributary, while San Jacinto River and
                    Buffalo Bayou enter it from the west 18 miles lower down.</p>
                <p>The mean rise and fall of tide at Galveston is 1 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛
                    feet, but springtides occasionally rise more than 3 feet above, and fall nearly
                    2 feet below the plane of mean low water, and fluctuations between much wider
                    limits are not uncommon under the influence of heavy winds. During a storm which
                    occurred in October 1867 the water rose 6 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ⅛ feet above mean low-water stage, and in September
                    1875 it rose in some portions of the bay 7 feet, and in others 9⅜ feet above the
                    same level. Two years later there was a rise of 5 <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅛
                    feet, produced by an onshore wind which reached a maximum velocity of 60 miles
                    per hour. The lowest tide of which we have any record fell 3 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅜ feet below mean low-water level, thus giving a
                    difference of 12⅛ feet between the highest and the lowest recorded tides.</p>
                <p>A sand bar, produced and maintained by the joint action of waves and currents,
                    stretches across, bow-shaped, in front of the entrance into the bay, restricting
                    the draught of vessels entering the harbour to from 12⅛ to 13 feet. The United
                    States Government has undertaken the improvement of this entrance by means of
                    two jetties, one starting from Fort Point and the other from near Bolivar Point,
                    having an aggregate length of about 7 miles. It is the intention to carry them
                    out to and beyond the crest of the bar on converging lines, so that their sea
                    ends, resting in about 18 feet water on the outer slope of the bar, will be
                    about 1 mile apart. It is expected that these jetties will co3t about
                    $2,000,000, and that they will produce and maintain a practicable channel depth
                    of 18 to 19 feet at mean low-water. Once inside this bar a draught of fully 20
                    feet can be carried to the wharves of the city. The Bolivar Point Jetty in
                    August 1879 had reached a length of 8,000 feet from the shore. That from Fort
                    Point had not been carried out so far. The peculiar mode of construction adopted
                    for these works by the superintending engineer, Major C. W. Howell, United
                    States Corps of Engineers, merits some notice here. The jetties are formed with
                    large gabions, or basket-work cylinders, plastered inside and out with hydraulic
                    cement, so as to give a thickness of 5 to 6 inches to the cylindrical wall. The
                    gabions are either circular, with a diameter of 6 feet, or of an oval crose
                    section, with diameters of 6 feet and 12 feet respectively. They are closed at
                    the bottom, and are also provided with a tight-fitting wooden cover. After being
                    sunk to their proper positions in the work, on their ends, arranged in a single
                    or double row, they are filled with sand pumped up from the bottom and passed in
                    through a hole left in the gabion cover. At first these gabions were placed
                    directly upon the bottom, but the action of the sea and currents caused so much
                    underscour and settlement, that a foundation of fascines formed into a mattress
                    and weighted with stones was resorted to. On the most exposed portions of the
                    works about one-sixth of the number of gabions put into position have been
                    destroyed by heavy storm-waves, so that this method of construction cannot as
                    yet be regarded as past the experimental stage.</p>
                <p>Galveston was first settled in 1837. It is handsomely laid out upon ground
                    elevated from 6⅛ to 10 feet above ordinary tide level, has wide and straight
                    streets, and has several public squares, parks, and gardens. The streets running
                    parallel to West Bay are known as avenues, and are designated by the letters of
                    the alphabet, beginning at the bay, while those at right angles to the water are
                    numbered. Special names are assigned to some of the streets. Avenue A, parallel
                    and next to the wharf or channel front, is mostly occupied by wholesale houses.
                    Next comes Avenue B, or ‘ ‘ The Strand,” and then Avenue C, or Mechanic Street,
                    both devoted largely to the wholesale business. Avenue D, or Market Street, for
                    a distance of seventeen squares, is occupied by retail stores, shops,
                    restaurants, hotels, banks, &amp;c. This is the main shopping street. Avenues E
                    and F are of the same character. The post-office and United States court-house
                    are at the intersection of Avenue F and 20th Street, and the custom-house is
                    near by. Avenue J, or Broadway, is regarded as the most desirable locality for
                    residences. It is 150 feet wide, including an esplanade 36 feet wide through the
                    middle and a 16-foot sidewalk on either side. Bath Avenue at right angles to
                    Broadway, is 12Q feet wide. Fremont, or 23d Street, is the principal drive in
                    the city, and is maintained as a shell road from “The Strand’’ to^the Gulf
                    beach. With the exceptions named, the streets are 80 feet and the avenues 70
                    feet wide, including 16 feet sidewalks, and the blocks or squares are uniformly
                    260 wide and 300 feet long, with an alley 20 feet wide running lengthwise
                    through the middle, along the rear of the lots. The portion of the city built
                    over extends from about 6th to 40th Streets, and from Avenue A south to within
                    two to three blocks of the Gulf beach. The only streets paved are four or five
                    blocks on Avenues B, C, and D. They are paved with blocks of heart cypress. The
                    same avenues are shelled from between 10th to 32d Streets, or thereabouts, with
                    clam shells from 18 to 30 inches deep. Trees are planted very generally on the
                    outer edge of the sidewalks, the oleander being the chief growth. It frequently
                    attains a height of 20 to 25 feet, and grows rapidly from slips with great
                    luxuriance, blooming the year round. The fig, orange, the black Hamburg and
                    other kinds of grape, and many varieties of flowers and evergreen shrubbery,
                    thrive and flourish. Throughout the most thickly-settled portions of the city
                    the sidewalks are paved with either asphaltum, concrete, brick, or German or
                    English tiles. Oleander Park embraces 80 acres, and the city park about 25
                    acres, and there are three public gardens and six public squares. The business
                    portion of the city is built up mostly with brick, and within certain defined
                    fire limits the erection of wooden buildings is prohibited.</p>
                <p>Among the public buildings, other than churches, are a post-office, custom-house,
                    United States court-house, a county court-house, a county and city prison, a
                    city hall, an opera house, 7 public halls, 2 libraries, 2 theatres, 13 hotels of
                    different grades, and 3 market houses. There are 30 schools of all kinds, 15
                    church edifices, a Roman Catholic university or college (St Mary’s), a medical
                    school, a convent, a house of refuge, an orphan asylum, and 3 hospitals. The St
                    Mary’s university was founded in 1854, and in 1872 had 8 professors and 35
                    collegiate and 115 preparatory students. The medical school, founded in 1864,
                    had ten years thereafter 6 professors. The convent (Ursuline) has 25 nuns and a
                    female academy connected with it. There are two other female academies in the
                    place. There are published in the town a number of daily, triweekly, and weekly
                    papers. Galveston is a bishop’s see of the Roman Catholic Church. The city is
                    well connected by railroad with different parts of the State, and by regular
                    steamship lines with Liverpool, New York, Havana, New Orleans, and the ports of
                    Texas. The Galveston, Houston, and Henderson Railroad crosses West Bay on a
                    wooden bridge 2 miles long, and by means of the Galveston Wharf Railroad
                    delivers and receives freight at the several wharves of the city. The Gulf,
                    Colorado, and Santa Fé Railroad, now building from Galveston to Belton, in Bell
                    County, a distance of 220 miles, is finished (September 1879) as far as
                    Richmond, a distance of 63 miles, and 57 miles moreto Brenham will be finished
                    by January 1, 1880. The entire road to Belton is to be completed by September
                    1881. This road crosses the Brazos River, below Richmond, on an iron bridge, and
                    has a wooden bridge of its own across West Bay. There are no highway bridges
                    connecting Galveston Island with the mainland.</p>
                <p>The cotton business of the place is represented by six cotton presses and many
                    immense brick warehouses, furnishing storageroom for nearly 200,000 bales of
                    cotton, and covering an area of more than 50 acres. There are two national
                    banks, with an authorized capital of $800,000, and a paid-up cash capital of
                    $300,000,— the aggregate paid-up capital of all the banks being upward of
                    $2,000,000. The assessed value of real estate in 1878 was over $20,000,000, and
                    the bonded debt $1,200,000.</p>
                <p>Galveston is a healthy city, possesses a delightful climate, and has not been
                    afflicted with an epidemic disease since 1867.</p>

                    rainfall at this place for five years ending June 30, 1878, has been compiled
                    from the reports of the Chief Signal Office, United States Army :—</p>

                <p>The decrease in the number of coasting vessels entered and cleared is accounted
                    for in part by the fact that the Morgan line of steamers from New Orleans, which
                    formerly entered here, now proceed up the bay to Clinton with original manifest,
                    and make the entry there, merely touching at Galveston to land freight,
                    passengers, and mails.</p>
                <p>The number of documented vessels owned in the customs district of Galveston
                    during the year ending June 30, 1878, was 197, with an aggregate tonnage of 9310
                    tons; built during the year, 9, with an aggregate tonnage of 239 tons; and lost
                    at sea, wrecked, or abandoned, 16, with a total tonnage of 387 tons.</p>
