                    (1628-1715), a sculptor whose works are typically characteristic of the epoch of
                    Louis XIV., was born at Troyes in 1628, and died in the Louvre in 1715. As a boy

                    France, and seems at once to have addressed himself with something like ignoble
                    subserviency to the task of conciliating Le Brun, who owed his start in life to
                    the same patron. Girardon is reported to have declared himself incapable of
                    composing a group, whether with truth or from motives of policy it is impossible
                    to say. This much is certain, that a very large proportion of his work was
                    carried out from designs by Le Brun, and shows the merits and defects of Le
                    Brun’s manner—a great command of ceremonial pomp in presenting his subject,
                    coupled with a large treatment of forms which if it were more expressive might
                    be imposing. The court which Girardon paid to the “premier peintre du roi” was
                    rewarded. An immense quantity of work at Versailles was entrusted to him, and in
                    recognition of the successful execution of four figures for the Bains d’Apollon,
                    Le Brun induced the king to present his*protegé personally with a purse of 300
                    louis, as a distinguishing mark of royal favour. In 1650 Girardon was made
                    member of the Academy, in 1659 professor, in 1674 “adjoint au recteur,” and
                    finally in 1695 chancellor. Five years before (1690), on the death of Le Brun,
                    he had also been appointed “inspecteur général des ouvrages de sculpture”— a
                    place of power and profit. In 1699 he completed the bronze equestrian statue of
                    Louis XIV., erected by the town of Paris on the Place Louis le Grand. This
                    statue was melted down during the Revolution, and is known to us only by a small
                    bronze model (Louvre) finished by Girardon himself. His Tomb of Richelieu
                    (church of the Sorbonne) was saved from destruction by M. Alexandre Lenoir, who
                    received a bayonet thrust in protecting the head of the cardinal from
                    mutilation. It is a capital example of Girardon’s work; but amongst other
                    important specimens yet remaining may also be cited the Tomb of Louvois (St
                    Eustache), that of Bignon (St Nicolas du Chardonneret), and decorative
                    sculptures in the Galerie d’Apollon and Chambre du roi, in the Louvre. Although
                    chiefly occupied at Paris, Girardon never forgot his native Troyes. In the Hôtel
                    de Ville is still shown a medallion of Louis XIV., and in the church of St Rémy
                    a bronze crucifix of some importance,— both works by his hand. In 1850 Μ.
