                    invaders first crossed the Abyssinian frontiers in the year 1537. The Gallas of
                    Gojam (a district along the northern side of the river Abai) tell how their
                    savage forefathers came from the south-east from a country on the other side of
                    a bahr (lake or river), and the Yedju and Raia Galla also point towards the east
                    and commemorate the passage of a bahr. Among the southern Gallas tradition
                    appears to be mainly concerned with the expulsion of the race from the country
                    now occupied by the Somali. It is usually maintained that the Gallas are
                    ethnographically of Semitic affinity, and find their nearest kinsmen in the
                    Somali, the Dankali, and the Abyssinians; but M. Lejean is of opinion that they
                    rather belong to the Aryan race, and this is so far supported by their
                    physiological characteristics. One thing is certain, that they have nothing in
                    common with the negro type; the “musculation” of the arms, thighs, and calves is
                    altogether different, and they have none of the fetor developed by the negro
                    skin; their frame is large and powerful, their complexion a very dark brown,
                    their brow broad and lofty, their eyes deep-sunk and lively, and their features
                    not unfrequently of a regular and finely-shaped description. Of the Semitic
                    affinity of the language their i3 no question, and according to the usual
                    classification it belongs to the same Semitico-Hamitic group as the Somali, the
                    Saho, and the Dankali.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The Gallas are for the most part still in the nomadic and pastoral stage; though,
                    as we advance northwards into Abyssinia, we find them more and more assimilated
                    to the settled and agricultural inhabitants of that kingdom. Among the southern
                    tribes it is said that about 7 or 8 head of cattle are kept for everyman, woman,
                    and child; and among the northern tribes, as neither man nor woman ever thinks
                    of going any distance on foot, the number of horses is very large. The ordinary
                    food consists of flesh, blood, milk, butter, and honey, the last being
                    considered of so much importance by the southern Gallas that a rude system of
                    bee-keeping is in vogue, and the husband who fails to furnish his wife with a
                    sufficient supply of honey may be excluded from all conjugal rights. This last
                    fact is one of those which indicate the comparatively high position occu-jried
                    by the Galla women, who, moreover, have the right, but rarely granted in a
                    savage state of society, of refusing an unacceptable offer of marriage. In the
                    south monogamy is the rule, but in the north the number of a man’s wives is
                    limited only by his wishes and his wealth. Each tribe has its own heiitch or
                    sultan, who enjoys the strange privilege of being the only merchant for his
                    people, but iu all public concerns must take the advice of the fathers of
                    families assembled in council. The greater proportion of the tribes are still
                    pagan, worshipping a supreme god Waka, and the subordinate god and goddess Oglia
                    and Atilia, whose favour is secured by sacrifices of oxen and sheep. With a
                    strange liberality of sentiment, they say that at a certain time of the year
                    Waka leaves them and goes to attend to the wants of their enemies the Somali,
                    whom also he lias created. Some tribes, and notably the Wollo-Galla, have been
                    converted to Mahometanism, and very bigoted adherents of the prophet they are.
                    In the north a kind of superficial Christianization has taken place, to the
                    extent at least that the people are familiar with the names of Maremma or Mary,
                    Balawold or Jesus, Girgis or St George, &amp;c.; but to all practical intents
                    paganism is still in force. The serpent is a special object of worship, the
                    northern Gallas believing that he is the author of the human race. A
                    considerable number of the men find employment in the Abyssinian armies, and in
                    comparison with their neighbours are brave and warlike. The total number of the
                    Gallas was estimated by Krapf at from six to eight millions, and Plowden
                    mentions individual tribes that could bring into the field 20,000 or 30,000
                    horse. Among the more important tribes in the south (the name in each instance
                    being compounded with Galla) are the Ramatta, the Kukatta, the Baôle, the
                    Aurova, the Wadjole, the llani, the Arrar, and the Kanigo Galla; the Borani, a
                    very powerful tribe, may be considered to mark the division between north and
                    south; and in the north we find the Amoro, the Jarso, the Toolama, the Wollo,
                    the Ambassil, the Aijjo, and the. Azobo Galla.</p>
