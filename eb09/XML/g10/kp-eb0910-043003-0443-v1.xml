                <p><label type="entry">GEORGETOWN</label>, known as Stabroek during the Dutch
                    period, now the capital of British Guiana, is situated in the county of Demerara
                    on the east bank of the Demerara river, about a mile from its mouth, in 6° 49'
                    30" N. lat. and 58° 1Γ 30" W. long. It is one of the prettiest towns of that
                    part of the world, and presents an unusually attractive appearance to the
                    approaching voyager. The streets are wide and straight, intersecting each other
                    at right angles, and recalling, by the canals that run along the centre, the
                    memory of the Dutch; and the houses are so richly embosomed by cabbage-palms,
                    cocoa-nut trees, and other trees and shrubs, that they look rather like a
                    collection of villas than a town. The street along the river side, where the
                    shops and stores are mainly situated, forms, however, an exception; there
                    everything is plain, bare, and business-like. Private dwelling-houses are
                    usually built of wood and raised 3 or 4 feet above the soil on wooden piles or
                    brick pillars; they are painted in various simple colours, for the most part in
                    white; in front they have open verandahs. Among the public edifices the first
                    place is due to a building in the centre of the town which was erected between
                    1829 and 1834'at a cost of £60,000, to accommodate the legislative council, the
                    courts of justice, the custom house, the treasury, and other administrative
                    offices; it is of considerable extent and architectural beauty, with shady
                    porticoes and marble-paved galleries supported on cast-iron columns. Besides a
                    cathedral, which cost £15,000, there are churches belonging to the Wesleyans,
                    the Baptists, the London Missionary Society, and other ecclesiastical
                    organizations, several liberally maintained hospitals, an icehouse, and two
                        market-places<pb break="no"

                    prison, a large building, or rather collection of buildings, surrounded by a
                    strong wooden wall, can accommodate upwards of 200 prisoners. A fort, the
                    Frederick William, situated below the town, only contains a small battery, but
                    in the vicinity there are extensive and well-organized barracks. One of the
                    principal disadvantages due to the position of Georgetown is the lack of
                    drinking water; but this is so far remedied by the construction of both private
                    and public tanks for the storage of the rain, by the introduction of water from
                    the Lamaha creek, by a canal, and further by the boring of Artesian wells. The
                    first attempts to apply the Artesian principle was made in 1831 by Major Staple,
                    and his example has been widely imitated not only in the town itself but also in
                    the surrounding country. Though the water thus obtained is strongly impregnated
                    with iron, carbonic acid gas, salt, and magnesia, it is readily drunk by horses
                    and cattle, and after it has been scummed and filtered it can be used for
                    cooking. As it rises to the surface the water has a temperature of 84° Fahr., 5°
                    higher than the water in the river. Ice is almost a necessity of life in the
                    town, and it forms a regular import from Boston, along with fresh meat and other
                    northern produce. The population of Georgetown in 1851 was 25,508; in 1861 it
                    was 29,174; and by 1871 it had reached 36,562. (See Appun, <hi rend="italic"
