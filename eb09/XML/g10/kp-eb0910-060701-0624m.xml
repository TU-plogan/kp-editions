                    Vasari, “because of the gifts of his person and the greatness of his mind.” Like
                    Lionardo da Vinci, Giorgione appears to have been of illegitimate birth. His
                    father belonged certainly to the gentle family of the Barbarella, of
                    Castelfranco in the Trevisan; his mother, it seems probable, was a peasant girl
                    of the neighbouring village of Vedelago; and he was born in or shortly before
                    the year 1477. In histories and catalogues he is now commonly styled Giorgio
                    Barbarella of Castelfranco; but it seems clear that he was humbly reared, and
                    only acknowledged by his father’s family when his genius had made him famous.
                    Twenty-seven years after his death, the brothers Matteo and Ercole Barbarella
                    were glad to inscribe the name of Giorgione among the members of their family in
                    whose honour they built and dedicated a monument in the church of San Liberale
                    in their native town. Presently this church was demolished and replaced by a new
                    one. In the course of this operation the inscription in question perished. Not
                    so a more important memorial of Giorgione’s greatness, in the shape of an
                    altarpiece which he painted for the same church on the commission of Tuzio
                    Costanzo. Tuzio Costanzo was a famous captain of free lances, who had followed
                    his mistress, the Queen Cornaro, from Cyprus to her retirement in the Trevisan,
                    and at the beginning of the 16th century was settled at Castelfranco. The
                    altar-piece with which Giorgione adorned the chapel of this patron in the old
                    church of San Liberale, was afterwards transferred to the new church, where it
                    remains to this day, so that there is something more than the mere memory of the
                    great painter to attract the lover of art on a pilgrimage to his native town.
                    Castelfranco is a hill fort standing in the midst of a rich and broken plain at
                    some distance from the last slopes of the Venetian Alps. Giorgione’s ideal of
                    luxuriant pastoral scenery, the country of pleasant copses, glades, and brooks,
                    amid which his personages love to wander or recline with lute and pipe, was
                    derived, no doubt, from these natural surroundings of his childhood. We cannot
                    tell how long he remained in their midst, nor what were the circumstances which
                    led him, while still, it seems, a boy, to Venice. Once there, we do not hear of
                    him until his genius is, so to speak, full-fledged. He appears all at once as a
                    splendid presence, the observed of all observers; an impassioned musician,
                    singer, lover; and, above all, as a painter winning new conquests for his art.
                    His progress from obscurity to fame, probably under the teaching of Giovanni
                    Bellini, must have been extraordinarily rapid, as he was still very young when
                    he was employed to paint the portraits of two successive doges, and of great
                    captains and princesses such as Gonzalvo of Cordova and Catharina Cornaro.
                    Giorgione effected, in the Venetian school, a change analogous to that effected
                    by Lionardo in the school of Florence,—a change, that is, which was less a
                    revolution than a crowning of the edifice. He added the last accomplishments of
                    freedom apd science to an art that at his advent only just fell short of both.
                    Venetian painting towards 1495 had reached the height of religious dignity in
                    the great altar-pieces of Bellini, the height of romantic sentiment and
                    picturesque animation in Carpaccio’s series from the legend of St Ursula. The
                    efforts of the school for nearly half a century had been concentrated on the
                    development, with the help of the new medium of oil, of colour as the great
                    element of emotional expression in painting. Giorgione came to enrich the art
                    with a more faultless <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n625/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0625-0608"/> design; with a system of colour yet more ardent,
                    melting, and harmonious; with a stronger sense of life and of the glory of the
                    real world as distinguished from the solemn dreamland of the religious
                    imagination. He had a power hitherto unknown of interpreting both the charm of
                    merely human grace and distinction, and the natural joy of life in the golden
                    sunlight among woods and meadow's. His active career cannot have extended over
                    more than fifteen years, since we know that he died in 1511,—according to one
                    account, of a contagious disorder: according to another, of grief at discovering
                    that his mistress had played false with a pupil. But in that brief career he had
                    both deeply modified the older manner of the Venetian school, as represented
                    even by a master so great and so austere as John Bellini, and had prepared the
                    way for its final manner, as represented by the most complete master of all,
                    Titian. Bellini, who outlived Giorgione, had not been ashamed to learn something
                    from the practice of a teacher fully forty years younger than himself, who was
                    probably in the first instance his own pupil. Titian, only ten years younger
                    than Giorgione, succeeded to his conquests, and enjoyed the leugth of days which
                    was denied him.</p>
                <p>A consecutive biography of Giorgione it is impossible to construct, either from
                    literary records or from extant works. The literary records only furnish us with
                    a few general characteristics, and with the mention of a few of his productions,
                    especially the frescos with which he adorned the front of the Fondaco dei
                    Tedeschi or hall of the German traders at Venice, after its destruction by fire
                    in 1504; and the frescos and altar-piece, sometimes attributed to the same year,
                    which he executed for Tuzio Costanzo in his native town. The decorations of the
                    Fondaco dei Tedeschi, which Vasari praises for their design and glowing colour,
                    but blames for their too fantastic and enigmatical invention, have unhappily
                    been utterly destroyed by the combined operation of weather and of reckless
                    architectural changes in the building. The frescos of the chapel of Castelfranco
                    were also sacrificed, while the altar-piece was preserved in the manner we have
                    related. A fragment of a lovemadrigal, which was once to be read on the back of
                    this panel, addressed apparently by the painter to his model, is quoted as in
                    character with our traditions of the man. The picture itself represents the
                    Virgin and Child enthroned, with a group of saints, and prominent among them the
                    warriorsaint Liberale, the patron of the church. A small and highly finished
                    study in armour for this figure is now one of the treasures of the National
                    Gallery in London, to which it was bequeathed by Mr Rogers. To Giorgione are
                    also attributed pictures in almost all the public and private galleries of
                    Europe, to a number ten times greater than could possibly be consistent with the
                    short duration of his career, and with the fact that no inconsiderable portion
                    of that career must have been occupied with the production of the perished
                    frescos. These so-called Giorgiones of the galleries may to some extent be
                    recognized and classified as the work of one or another of several groups of
                    painters whose manner was more or less akin to, or influenced by, that of Venice
                    in Giorgione’s days. One such group belongs to Bergamo; another to Brescia;
                    another is in alliance with Palma; another with Titian; another, again, consists
                    of the later and looser imitators of the masteι∙ himself, as Andrea and
                    Schiavone, Pietro della Vecchia and Rocco Marcone. It is probable, indeed, that
                    those distinguished authorities, Messrs Crowe and Cavalcaselle, have gone too
                    far in excluding from the genuine work of Giorgione several of the most famous
                    pictures which have hitherto passed as standards whereby to judge his manner,
                    as, for instance, the Entombment of Christ at Treviso, and particularly the
                    beautiful Concert of the Louvre. Without, however, entering upon disputed
                    ground, there remains a reasonable number of undoubted pictures of the master,
                    and these, while they possess in common the qualities of feeling and invention
                    which we have above defined, in technical style vary from a minute and
                    painstaking precision, almost like that of Antonello da Messina, or of Bellini
                    in his earlier manner, to a degree of breadth, glow, and softness, which are the
                    qualities more popularly associated with the name of Giorgione, and more
                    commonly attempted by his imitators.</p>
                <p>We conclude with a mention of a few of the principal undisputed examples of
                    Giorgione’s handiwork, following a chronological older, which, however, it
                    should be understood, is necessarily but approximate and conjectural. Florence,
                    Uffizi: an Ordeal of Moses, and a Judgment of Solomon,—small pictures with rich
                    landscape accessories, and figures of extraordinary grace and delicacy, painted
                    apparently in imitation or in rivalry of the New Testament allegory by Bellini,
                    in the same manner, which is preserved in the same gallery; all three were
                    originally in the summer residence of the Medici at Poggio Imperiale. London,
                    collection of Mr Wentworth Beaumont: Holy Family, with the angel appearing to
                    the shepherds in the background,—again a small picture, very delicately
                    finished; formerly in the possession of Cardinal Fesch. London, National
                    Gallery: the Study for San Liberale above mentioned. Castelfranco, Church of San
                    Liberale: the altar-piece,— figures life size, exhibiting much of the manner of
                    Bellini in his altar-pieces. Vienna, Belvedere Gallery: a Group of Astronomers
                    in a Glade, known as the Chaldeans,—rich sunset landscape, with villages in the
                    distance and trees in the foreground; beside the trees on the left, three
                    figures in Oriental costumes, one-third of life size; formerly in the Taddeo
                    Contarini gallery. Venice, Manfrini palace: man, woman, and child, known as the
                    Family of Giorgione, in a landscape recalling the neighbourhood of
                    Castelfranco,—one of the most beautiful works of the master, formerly in the
                    house of Gabriel Vendramin at Santa Fosca. England, Kingston Lacy, collection of
                    MrBankes: Judgment of Solomon,—a large unfinished picture of great beauty, of
                    clearer tones and broader treatment than the foregoing, bought, at the
                    suggestion of Lord Byron, from the Marescalchi gallery. Florence, Pitti:
                    Concert,—a monk of the Augustinians, seated at the harpsichord; behind him, a
                    clerk with a viol; on the left a young man with plumed hat and long hair. This
                    is the most perfect of all the works which are assumed to belong to the later
                    time of the master.</p>
