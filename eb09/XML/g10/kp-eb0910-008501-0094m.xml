                <p>WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, the founder and leader of the movement for the abolition
                    of slavery in the United States of America, was born in Newburyport,
                    Massachusetts, December 10, 1805. His parents were from the British province of
                    New Brunswick. The father, a sea-captain, went away from home when William was a
                    child, and it is not known whether he died at sea or on the laud. The mother is
                    said to have been a woman of high character, charming in person, and eminent for
                    piety. For her William had the deepest reverence, and he is supposed to have
                    inherited from her the moral qualities that specially fitted him for his career.
                    She was entirely dependent for the support of herself and children upon her
                    labours as a nurse. She was able to give William but a meagre chance for an
                    education, but he had a taste for books, and made the most of his limited
                    opportunities. She first set him to learn the trade of a shoemaker, and, when
                    she found this did not suit him, let him try his hand at cabinetmaking. But the
                    latter pleased him no better than the former. In October 1818, however, when he
                    was in his fourteenth year, he was made more than content by being indentured to
                    Ephraim W. Allen, proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Newburyport Herald,</hi>
                    to learn the trade of a printer. He found in this occupation a happy stimulus to
                    his literary taste and ambition, as well as some available opportunities for
                    mental culture. He soon became an expert compositor, and after a time began to
                    write anonymously for the <hi rend="italic">Herald.</hi> His communications won
                    the commendation of the editor, who had not at first the slightest suspicion
                    that he was the author. He also wrote for other papers with equal success. A
                    series of political essays, written by him for the <hi rend="italic">Salem
                    Gazette, was,</hi> copied by a prominent Philadelphia journal, the editor of
                    which attributed them to the Hon. Timothy Pickering, a distinguished statesman
                    of Massachusetts. His skill as a printer won for him the position of foreman,
                    while his ability as a writer was so marked that the editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Herald,</hi> when temporarily called away from his post, left the
                    paper in his charge.</p>
                <p>The printing-office was for him, what it has been for many another poor boy, no
                    mean substitute for the academy and the college. He was full of enthusiasm for
                    liberty; the struggle of the Greeks to throw off the Turkish yoke enlisted his
                    warmest sym pathy, and at one time he seriously thought of entering the West
                    Point Academy and fitting himself for a soldier’s career. His apprenticeship
                    ended with his minority in 1826, when he began the publication of a new paper,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Free Press,</hi> in his native place. This paper was full
                    of spirit and intellectual force, but Newburyport was a sleepy place and did not
                    appreciate a periodical so fresh and free; and so the enterprise failed. Mr
                    Garrison then went to Boston, where, after working for a time as a journeyman
                    printer, he became the editor of the <hi rend="italic">National
                    Philanthropist,</hi> the first journal established in America to promote the
                    cause of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors. His work iιi this paper was
                    highly appreciated by the friends of temperance, but a change in the
                    proprietorship led to his withdrawal before the end of a year. In 1828 he was
                    induced to establish the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Times</hi> at
                    Bennington, Vermont, to support the re-election to the presidency of the United
                    States of John Quincy Adams. The new paper, though attractive in many ways, and
                    full of force and fire, was too far ahead of public sentiment on moral questions
                    to win a large support. Whether or not it would have lived if he had continued
                    to be its editor, it is impossible to say; but the time had come at last when he
                    was to enter upon the work with which his name will be for ever associated. In
                    Boston he had met Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker philanthropist, who had been for
                    years engaged in an effort to convince the people of the United States that they
                    ought to do something to promote the abolition of slavery. Mr Garrison had been
                    deeply moved by Mr Lundy’s appeals, and after going to Vermont he showed the
                    deepest interest in the slavery question. Mr Lundy was then publishing in
                    Baltimore a small monthly paper, entitled <hi rend="italic">Genius of Universal
                    Emancipation,</hi> and he resolved to go to Bennington and invite Mr Garrison to
                    join him in the editorship. With this object in view he walked from Boston to
                    Bennington, through the frost and snow of a New England winter, a distance of
                    125 miles. His mission was successful. Mr Garrison was deeply impressed by the
                    good Quaker’s zeal and devotion, and he resolved to join him and devote himself
                    thereafter to the work of abolishing slavery.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of this plan he went to Baltimore in the autumn of 1829, and
                    thenceforth the <hi rend="italic">Genius</hi> was published weekly, under the
                    joint editorship of the two men. It was understood, however, that Mr Garrison
                    would do most of the editorial work, while Mr Lundy would spend most of his time
                    in lecturing and procuring subscribers. On one point the two editors differed
                    radically, Lundy being the advocate of gradual, and Garrison the champion of
                    immediate emancipation. The former was possessed with the idea that the negroes,
                    on being emancipated, must be colonized somewhere beyond the limits of the
                    United States; the latter held that they should be emancipated on the soil of
                    the country, with all the rights of freemen. In view of this difference it was
                    agreed that each should speak on his own individual responsibility in the paper,
                    appending his initial to each of his articles for the information of the reader.
                    It deserves mention here that Mr Garrison was then in utter ignorance of the
                    change previously wrought in the opinions of English abolitionists by Elizabeth
                    Heyrick’s pamphlet in favour of immediate, in distinction from gradual
                    emancipation. The sinfulness of slavery being admitted, the duty of immediate
                    emancipation to his clear ethical instinct was perfectly manifest. He saw that
                    it would be idle to expose and denounce the evils of slavery, while
                    responsibility for the system was placed upon former generations, and the duty
                    of abolishing it transferred to an indefinite future. His demand for immediate
                    emancipation fell like a tocsin upon the ears of slaveholders. For general talk
                    about the evils of slavery they cared little, but this assertion that every
                    slave was entitled to instant freedom filled them with alarm and roused them to
                    anger, for they saw that, if the conscience of the nation were to respond to the
                    proposition, the system must inevitably fall. The <hi rend="italic">Genius,</hi>
                    now that it had become a vehicle for this dangerous doctrine, was a paper to be
                    feared and intensely hated. Baltimore was then one of the centres of the
                    domestic slave trade, and upon this traffic Mr Garrison heaped the strongest
                    denunciations. A vessel owned in Newburyport having taken a cargo of slaves from
                    Baltimore to New Orleans, he characterized the transaction as an act of
                    “domestic piracy,” and avowed his purpose to “cover with thick infamy” those
                    engaged therein. He was thereupon prosecuted for libel by the owner of the
                    vessel, fined in the sum of fifty dollars, mulcted in costs of court, and, in
                    default of payment, committed to jail. His imprisonment created much excitement,
                    and in some quarters, in spite of the proslavery spirit of the time, was a
                    subject of indignant comment in public as well as private. The excitement was
                    fed by the publication of two or three striking sonnets, instinct with the
                    spirit of liberty, which Mr Garrison inscribed on the walls of his cell. One of
                    these, <hi rend="italic">Freedom of Mind,</hi> is remarkable for freshness of
                    thought and terseness of expression, and will probably hold a permanent place in
                    American literature.</p>
                <p>John G. Whittier, the Quaker poet, interceded with Henry Clay to pay Mr
                    Garrison’s fine and thus release him from prison. To the credit of the
                    slaveholding statesman it must be said that he resDonded favourably, but before
                    he had time for the requisite preliminaries<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0095-0086"/>, Mr Arthur Tappan, a philanthropic merchant of
                    NewYork, contributed the necessary sum and set the prisoner free after an
                    incarceration of seven weeks. The partnership between Mi-Garrison and Mr Lundy
                    was then dissolved by mutual consent, and the former resolved to establish a
                    paper of his own, iu which, upon his sole responsibility, he could advocate the
                    doctrine of immediate emancipation and oppose the scheme of African
                    colonization. He was sure, after his experiences at Baltimore, that a movement
                    against slavery resting upon any less radical foundation than this would be
                    inefficacious, lie first proposed to establish his paper at Washington, in the
                    midst of slavery, but ou returning to New England and observing the state of
                    public opinion there, he came to the conclusion that little could be done at the
                    South while the nonslaveholding North was lending her influence, through
                    political, commercial, religious, and social channels, for the sustenance of
                    slavery, lie determined, therefore, to publish his paper in Boston, and, having
                    issued his prospectus, set himself to the task of awakening an interest in the
                    subject by means of lectures in some of the principal cities and towns of the
                    North. It was an up-hill work. Contempt for the negro and indifference to his
                    wrongs were almost universal. In Boston, then a great cotton mart, he tried in
                    vain to procure a church or vestry for the delivery of his lectures, and
                    thereupon announced in one of the daily journals that if some suitable place was
                    not promptly offered he would speak on the common. A body of infidels proffered
                    him the use of their small hall; and, no other place being accessible, he
                    accepted it gratefully, and delivered therein three lectures, in which he
                    unfolded his principles and plans. He visited privately many of the leading
                    citizens of the city, statesmen, divines, and merchants, and besought them to
                    take the lead in a national movement against slavery; but they all with one
                    consent made excuse, some of them listening to his plea with manifest
                    impatience. He was disappointed, but not disheartened. His conviction of the
                    righteousness of his cause, of the evils and dangers of slavery, and of the
                    absolute necessity of the contemplated movement, was intensified by opposition,
                    and he resolved to go forward, trusting in God for success.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of January 1831, without a dollar of capital save in hand and brain,
                    and without a single subscriber, he and his partner issued the first number of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Liberator,</hi> avowing their “determination to print it
                    as long as they could subsist on bread and water, or their hands obtain
                    employment.” Its motto w-as, “Our country is the world—our countrymen are
                    mankind and the editor, in his address to the public, uttered the words which
                    have become memorable as embodying the whole purpose and spirit of his life ‘ ‘
                    I am in earnest—I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a
                    single inch—and I will be heard.” Help came but slowly. For many months Mr
                    Garrison and his brave partner, Mr Isaac Knapp, who died long before the end of
                    the conflict, made their bed on the floor of the room, “dark, un furni tured,
                    and mean,” in which they printed their paper, and where the mayor of Boston, in
                    compliance with the request of a distinguished magistrate of the South, ‘
                    ‘ferreted them out,” in “an obscure hole,” ‘ ‘their only visible auxiliary a
                    negro boy.” But the paper founded under such inauspi- -cious circumstances
                    exerted a mighty influence, and lived to record not only President Lincoln’s
                    proclamation of emancipation, but the adoption of an amendment to the
                    constitution of the United States for ever prohibiting slavery. It was the
                    beginning and the nucleus of an agitation that eventually pervaded and filled
                    every part of the country, and that baffled alike the wiles of politicians and
                    parties and the devices of those pulpits and ecclesiastical bodies which forgot
                    that Jesus came to preach deliverance to the captives and the opening of the
                    prison to them that are bound. Other newspapers were afterwards established upon
                    the same principles; anti-slavery societies, founded upon the doctrine of
                    immediate emancipation, sprang up on every hand; the agitation was carried into
                    political parties, into the press, and into legislative and ecclesiastical
                    assemblies; until in 1860 the Southern States, taking alarm from the elcctiou of
                    a president known to be at heart opposed to slavery though pledged to enforce
                    all the constitutional safeguards of the system, seceded from the Union and set
                    up a separate government. In the struggle that ensued slavery was abolished by
                    an exercise of the powers of war, as a necessary means of restoring the
                    Union.</p>
                <p>Mr Garrison sought the abolition of slavery by moral means alone. He knew that
                    the national Goverument had no power over the system in any State, though it
                    could abolish it at the national capital, and prohibit it in the inchoate
                    States, called Territories. He thought it should, by the exercise of such
                    limited powers as it possessed, bring its moral influence to bear in favour of
                    abolition; but neither he nor his associates ever asked Congress to exercise any
                    unconstitutional power. Hie idea was to combine the moral influence of the
                    North, and pour it through every open channel upon the South. To this end he
                    made his appeal to the Northern churches and pulpits, beseeching them to bring
                    the power βf Christianity to bear against the slave system, and to advocate the
                    right of the slaves to immediate and unconditional freedom. He thought that,
                    under the moral pressure thus created, and which would be re-enforced by the
                    civilization and Christianity of the foremost nations of the world, the South
                    would speedily give way and proclaim freedom to her bondmen. He was a man of
                    peace, hating war not less than he did slavery; but he warned his countrymen
                    that if they refused to abolish slavery by moral power a retributive war must
                    sooner or later ensue. The conflict was irrepressible. Slavery must be
                    overthrown, if not by peaceful means, then in blood. The first society organized
                    under Mr Garrison’s auspices, and in accordance with his principles, was the
                    “New England Anti-Slavery Society,” which adopted its constitution in January
                    1832. In the spring of this year Mr Garrison issued his work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoughts on African Colonization,</hi> in which he showed by ample
                    citations from official documents that the American Colonization Society was
                    organized in the interest of slavery, and that in offering itself to the people
                    of the North as a practical remedy for that system it was guilty of deception.
                    His book smote the society with a paralysis from which it has never recovered.
                    Agents of the American Colonization Society in England having succeeded in
                    deceiving leading abolitionists there as to the character and tendency of that
                    Society, Mr Garrison was deputed by the New England Anti-Slavery Society to
                    visit that country for the purpose of counteracting their influence. He went in
                    the spring of 1833, when he was but twenty-seven years of age, and was received
                    with great cordiality by British abolitionists, some of whom had heard of his
                    bold assaults upon American slavery, and seen a few numbers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liberator.</hi> The struggle for emancipation in the West Indies
                    was then at the point of culmination; the leaders of the cause, from all parts
                    of the kingdom, were assembled in London, and Mr Garrison was at once admitted
                    to their councils and treated with distinguished consideration. He formed the
                    acquaintance of Wilberforce, Clarkson, Buxton, O’Connell, George Thompson, and
                    many others, and was greatly cheered by what he saw and heard. He waκ thoroughly
                    successful in his efforts to undeceive the people of England in respect to the
                    character and designs of the American Colonization Society, and took home with
                    him a “Protest” against it, signed by Wilberforce, Zachary Macaulay, Samuel
                    Gurney, William Evans, S. Lushington, T. Fowell Buxton, James Cropper, Daniel
                    O’Connell, and others, in which they declared their deliberate judgment that
                    “its precepts were delusive,” and “its real effects of the most dangerous
                    nature.” He also received assurances of the cordial sympathy of British
                    abolitionists with him in his efforts to abolish American slavery. He gained a
                    hearing before a large popular assembly in London, and won the confidence of
                    those whom he addressed by his evident earnestness, sincerity, and ability.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, before he had an opportunity of meeting him, invited
                    him to breakfast at his house. Mr Garrison presented himself at the appointed
                    time; but Mr Buxton, instead of coming forward promptly to take his hand,
                    scrutinized him from head to foot, and then inquired, somewhat dubiously, “Have
                    1 the pleasure of addressing Mr Garrison, of Boston, in the United States ?”
                    Being answered in the affirmative, he lifted up his hands and exclaimed, “Why,
                    my dear sir, I thought you were a black man, and I have consequently invited
                    this company of ladies and gentlemen to be present to welcome Mr Garrison, the
                    black advocate of emancipation, from the United States of America.” Mi-Garrison
                    often said that, of all the compliments he ever received, this was the only one
                    that he cared to remember or repeat; for Mr Buxton had somehow or other supposed
                    that no white American-could plead for those in bondage as he had done, and that
                    therefore he must be black. Mr Garrison’s visit to England enraged the
                    pro-slavery people and press of the United States at the outset, and when he
                    returned home in September with the “Protest” against the Colonization Society,
                    and announced that he had engaged the services of George Thompson as a lecturer
                    against American slavery, there were fresh outbursts of rage on every hand. The
                    American Anti-Slavery Society was organized in December of that year, putting
                    forth a masterly declaration of its principles and purposes from the pen of Mr
                    Garrison. This added fresh fuel to the public excitement, and when Mr Thompson
                    came over in the next spring, the hostility to the cause began to manifest
                    itself in mobs organized to suppress the discussion of the slavery question. Now
                    began what Harriet Martineau called “the martyr age in America.” Mr Thompson
                    gained a favourable hearing in a few places, but his appearance in any town or
                    city became at length the signal of a mob, and in the fall of 1835 he was
                    compelled, in order to save his life, to embark secretly for England. Just
                    before his departure, the announcement that he would address the Woman’s
                    AntiSlavery Society of Boston created “a mob of gentlemen of property and
                    standing,” from which, if he had been present, he could hardly have escaped with
                    his life. The whole city was in an uproar. Mr Garrison, almost denuded of his
                    clothing, was dragged through the streets by infuriated men with a rope around
                    his body, by which they doubtless intended to hang him. He was rescued with
                    great difficulty, and consigned to the jail for safety, until he could be
                    secretly removed from the city. For two or three years these attempts to
                    suppress the anti-slavery movement by violence <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n96/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0096-0087"/> were persisted in, but it was like attempting to
                    extinguish a fire by pouring oil upon the flames, or like an effort to stop the
                    roar of Niagara by increasing the volume of its waters.</p>
                <p>Anti-slavery societies were greatly multiplied throughout the North, and many men
                    of influence, both in the church and in the state, were won to the cause. Mr
                    Garrison, true to his original purpose, never faltered or turned back. Other
                    friends of the cause were sometimes discouraged—he, never. The abolitionists of
                    the United States were a united body until 1839-40, when divisions Sprang up
                    among them. Mr Garrison countenanced the activity of women in the cause, even to
                    the'extent of allowing them to vote and speak in the anti-slavery societies, and
                    appointing them as lecturing agents. To this a strong party was opposed upon
                    social and religious grounds. Then there were some who thought Mr Garrison dealt
                    too severely with the churches and pulpits for their complicity with slavery,
                    and who accused him of a want of religious orthodoxy. He was, moreover, a
                    non-resistant, and this to many was distasteful. The dissentients from his
                    opinions determined to form an anti-slavery political party, while he believed
                    in working by moral rather than political party instrumentalities. These
                    differences led to the organization of a new National Anti-Slavery Society in
                    1840, and to the formation of the “Liberty Party” in politio«. The two societies
                    sent their delegates to the World’s Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840,
                    and Mr Garrison refused to take his seat in that body, because the women
                    delegates from the United States were excluded. The discussions of the next few
                    years served to make clearer than before the practical workings of the
                    constitution of the United States as a shield and support of slavery; and Mr
                    Garrison, after long and painful reflexion, came to the conclusion that its
                    pro-slavery clauses were immoral, and that it was therefore wrong to take an
                    oath for its support. The Southern States had a greatly enlarged representation
                    in Congress on account of their slaves, and the national Government was
                    constitutionally bound to assist in the capture of fugitive slaves, and to
                    suppress every attempt on their part to gain their freedom by force. Iu view of
                    these provisions, Mr Garrison, adopting a bold scriptural figure of speech,
                    denounced the Union as “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell,” and
                    adopted as his motto the legend, “No union with slaveholders.” His argument on
                    this question, in the light of ethical principles generally admitted to be
                    sound, could not easily be answered, and many men, who shrank from the
                    conclusion that followed therefrom, were held by it as in a vice. His exposures
                    of the character and practical working of the pro-slavery clauses of the
                    constitution, in spite of the impatience with which they were regarded in some
                    quarters, made a deep impression upon the national conscience, and served to
                    abate that undiscriminating aud idolatrous reverence for the Union, upon which
                    the slaveholders had so long relied for the protection of their system.</p>
                <p>One class of abolitionists sought to evade the difficulty by strained
                    interpretations of the clauses referred to, while others, admitting that they
                    were immoral, felt themselves obliged, notwithstanding, to support the
                    constitution in order to avoid what they thought would be still greater evils.
                    The American AntiSlavery Society, of which Mr Garrison was the president from
                    1843 to the day of emancipation, was during all this period the nucleus of an
                    intense and powerful moral agitation, which was greatly valued by the soundest
                    and most faithful workers in the field of politics, who greatly respected him
                    for his fidelity to his convictions. On the other hand, Mr Garrison always had
                    the highest respect for every earnest and faithful opponent of slavery, however
                    far he might be from adopting his special views. He was intolerant of nothing
                    but conscious treachery to the cause. When in 1861 the Southern States seceded
                    from the Union and took up arms against it, he saw clearly that slavery would
                    perish in the struggle, that the constitution would be purged of its pro-slavery
                    clauses, and that the Union thenceforth, instead of being “a covenant with death
                    and an agreement with hell,” would rest upon the sure foundations of liberty,
                    justice, and equality to all men. He therefore ceased from that hour to advocate
                    disunion, and devoted himself to the task of preparing the way for and hastening
                    on the inevitable event. His services at this period were recognized and
                    honoured by President Lincoln and others in authority, and the whole country
                    knew that the agitation which made the abolition of slavery feasible and
                    necessary was due to his uncompromising spirit aud indomitable courage. He lived
                    to witness the redemption of his country from the curse of human bondage, not
                    indeed by the means which he preferred, and which he hoped would prove
                    sufficiently potent, but by the bloody arbitrament of war. None the less,
                    however, did he see in the great event the hand of that Divine Providence on
                    which he had always relied for support in the great struggle to which his life
                    was devoted. In 1865, at the close of the war, he declared that, slavery being
                    abolished, his career as an abolitionist was ended. He counselled a dissolution
                    of the American Anti-Slavery Society, insisting that it had become <hi
                    rend="italic">functus</hi><hi rend="italic">officiis,</hi> aud that whatever
                    needed to be done for the protection of the freedmen could best be accomplished
                    by new associations formed for that purpoβe. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liberator</hi> was discontinued at the end of the same year, after an existence
                    of thirty-five years. He visited England for the second time in 1846, and again
                    in 1867, when he was received with distinguished honours, public as well as
                    private. In 1877, when he was there for the last time, he declined every form of
                    public recognition. He died in New York, May 24, 1879, in the seventy-fourth
                    year of his age, and was buried in Boston, after a most impressive funeral
                    service, May 28. In 1843 a small volume of his <hi rend="italic">Sonnets and
                    other Poems</hi> was published, and iu 1852 appeared a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Selections from his Writings and Speeches.</hi> His wife, Helen
                    Eliza Benson, died in 1876. Four sons and one daughter survive them.</p>
