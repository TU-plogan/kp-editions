                    frontiers must have been of a very uncertain and shifting character. The
                    Gaetulians. who, according to a tradition mentioned by Sallust, were one of the
                    two great aboriginal races of northern Africa, appear to have retreated inland
                    before the encroachments of the Numidians and Mauretanians, but continued to
                    make incursions over a wide stretch of country. Ethnographically, they were
                    quite distinct from the negro races, and indeed probably belonged to the great
                    Berber race, which still forms so important an element in the population of
                    North Africa. Their southern tribes having mingled with negro tribes, acquired
                    the distinctive title of Melano-Gaetuli or Black Gaetulians. A warlike, roving
                    people, they bestowed great attention on the rearing of horses, and, according
                    to Strabo, had 100,000 foals in the course of a year. They were clad in skins,
                    lived on flesh and the milk of their cows, mares, and camels, and took almost no
                    advantage of the valuable productions of their country. It was not till the
                    Jugurthine war that they became familiar to the Romans; but afterwards their
                    name occurs with great frequency in Latin poetical literature, and, indeed, the
                    adjective Gaetulian became little more than a synecdoche for African. Allusions
                    are more particularly made to Gaetulian purple, which was obtained from the
                    murex of the African coast. In the Jugurthine war some of the Gaetulian tribes
                    assisted the Numidian king with a contingent of horse; but during the civil war
                    Caesar found among them very serviceable allies in his contest with Juba.
                    Augustus, having made Numidia a Roman province, affected to assign a portion of
                    the Gaetulian territory to Juba as a compensation; but the Gaetulians rose in
                    revolt and massacred the Roman residents, and it was not till a severe defeat
                    had been inflicted on them by Cossius Lentulus that they consented to recognize
                    their gratuitous sovereign. By his victory Lentulus acquired the title of
                    Gaetulicus. Ibn Said in the middle of the 13th century, Ibn Khaldun at the end
                    of the 14 th, Leo Africanus in the beginning of the 16th, and Marmol about sixty
                    years later, are all quoted by Μ. Vivien de St Martin in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nord de VAfrique,</hi> 1863, as mentioning a
                    mountainous country called Gozulé, Gutzula, or Guézula in the south of Morocco.
                    He is disposed further to identify the Gaetulians with the Godâla, who,
                    according to Ibn Said, occupied the maritime portion of the great desert, and
                    are referred to by other Arabian geographers as the Djoddala; and it is even
                    possible, he thinks, that their name survives in that of the Ghedala between
                    Cape Blanco and the Lower Senegal on the one hand, and that of the Beni
                    Guechtula in the Algerian province of Bougie on the other.</p>
