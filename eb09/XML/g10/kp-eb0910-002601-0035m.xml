                    115 miles; area, 11,222 square miles; population (1867), 1,937,792. Galicia is
                    traversed from E. to W. by a continuation of the great Pyrenean and Cantabrian
                    chain; and its surface is further broken by two spurs from that system, which,
                    running in a south-westerly direction, enclose the basin of the Mino. The
                    average elevation of the province is considerable, and the maximum height (6593
                    feet) is reached in the Pena Trevinca on the east border of Orense. The
                    principal river is the Mino (Portuguese, <hi rend="italic">Minho;</hi> Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Minius;</hi><hi rend="italic">so</hi> named, it is said, from the
                    minium or vermilion found in its bed), which, rising near Mondonedo, within 20
                    miles of the northern coast, after a course of 170 miles in a south and south
                    west direction, enters the Atlantic near the port of La Guardia. It is navigable
                    by small vessels on the lower part of its course. Of the numerous affluents of
                    the Mino, the most important are—on the left the Sil, which rises among the
                    lofty mountains between Leon and Asturias, and on the right the Tea, which rises
                    on the eastern flank of Monte Fano. Among other rivers having a westerly
                    direction may be mentioned the Tambre, the Ulla, and the Lerez or Ler, which
                    fall into the Atlantic by estuaries or <hi rend="italic">mas</hi> called
                    respectively Ria Muros y Noya, Ria Arosa, and Ria Pontevedra. The rivers of the
                    northern versant, such as the Eume, the Juvia, and the Mero, are, like those of
                    the Asturias, for the most part short, rapid, and subject to violent floods. The
                    coast-line of Galicia, extending to about 240 miles, is every where bold and
                    deeply indented, presenting a large number of secure harbours, in this respect
                    forming a marked contrast to the neighbouring province. The Eo, which bounds
                    Galicia on the east, has a deep estuary, the Rivadeo, which offers a safe and
                    commodious anchorage in 3 fathoms water at ebbtide. Further to the west is
                    Vivero Bay, 1 mile wide and 3 in length, affording good anchorage throughout,
                    with from 6 to'J&gt; fathoms of water. The*∙Ria del Varquero y Vares is of a
                    similar character; while the harbour of Ferrol (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ferrol)</hi> ranks among the best in Europe. On the opposite side of Betanzos
                    Bay (the ρ,εγας <hi rend="italic">λψfv</hi> or Portus Magnus of the ancients) is
                    the great port of Coruna (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Corunna).</hi> The principal
                    port on the western coast of Galicia is that formed by the deep and sheltered
                    bay of Vigo, which is navigable for vessels of 500 tons to a distance of 16
                    miles from the ocean; but there are also good roadsteads at Corcubion under Cape
                    Finisterre, at Marin, and at Carril. The climate of the Galician coast is mild
                    and equable, but the interior, owing to the great elevation (the town of Lugo is
                    upwards of 1900 feet above the sea level), has a wide range of temperature. The
                    rainfall is exceptionally large, and snow lies on some of the loftier elevations
                    for a considerable portion of the year. The soil is on the whole fertile, and
                    the produce very varied. A considerable quantity of timber is grown on the high
                    lands, and the rich valley pastures support large herds of cattle, while the
                    abundance of oak and chestnut favours the rearing of swine. In the lowland
                    districts good crops of maize, wheat, barley, oats, and rye, as well as of
                    turnips and potatoes, are obtained. The fruit also is of excellent quality and
                    in great variety, although the culture of the vine is limited to some of the
                    warmer valleys in the southern districts. The dehesas or moorlands abound in
                    game, and fish are plentiful in all the streams. The mineral resources of the
                    province, which are considerable, were known to some extent to the ancients.
                    Strabo speaks of its gold and tin, and Pliny mentions the gemma Gallaica. Mines
                    of lead, tin, copper, and iron pyrites continue to be wrought, though under
                    considerable disadvantages, and chiefly by foreign capitalists. Galicia is also
                    remarkable for the number of its sulphur and other warm springs, the most
                    important of which are those at Lugo and those from which Orense is said to take
                    its name (Aquae urentes).</p>
                <p>Ethnologically the Galicians (Gallegos) are allied to the Portuguese, whom they
                    resemble in dialect, in appearance, and in habits more than the other
                    inhabitants of the peninsula. The men are well known all over Spain, and also in
                    Portugal, as hardy, honest, and industrious, but for the most part somewhat
                    unskilled, labourers; indeed the word Gallego has come to be almost a synonym in
                    Madrid for a “hewer of .wood and drawer of water.” Agriculture engages the
                    greater part of the resident population, both male and female; other industries
                    are little developed, and the fisheries are not extensive. There are a few linen
                    and cotton factories in the larger towns, The principal exports are live cattle,
                    preserved meats, eggs, bones, mineral ore, fish oil, salt fish (especially
                    sardines), chestnuts and other nuts, grain (especially maize), and potatoes. The
                    first-mentioned<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0036-0027"/> item is the most considerable; the exports to
                    England from Coruna alone having mounted in 1875 to 17,000 head, at an average
                    value of £15. The chief imports are coal, iron, tobacco, and manufactured goods.
                    Apart from the few carreteras reales or royal roads, which are, as elsewhere in
                    the Peninsula, unexceptionable, the means of internal communication in Galicia
                    are decidedly defective. The only railways are those betwixt Lugo and Coruna (61
                    miles), and betwixt Santiago and Carril (24⅛ miles). Another line, from Vigo to
                    Orense, has been in course of construction for some time, and it is also
                    proposed to connect Lugo with Astorga. Galicia has 10 cities and 115 towns. The
                    capital is Santiago, which is also an archbishopric, with a population of
                    29,000. Lugo, Tuy, Mondonedo, Orense, are also episcopal sees. The largest city
                    is Coruna, the seat of the audiencia (population about 40,000). The others are
                    Ferrol, Vigo, Betanzos, and Pontevedra.</p>
                <p>Gall⅛cia, the country of the Callaici or Gallaici, seems to have been veYy
                    imperfectly known to the earlier geographers. According to Eratosthenes the
                    entire population of the peninsula were at one time called Galatae. The region
                    properly called by their name, bounded on the S. by the Douro and on the E. by
                    the Navia, was first entered by the Roman legions under Decius Junius Brutus in
                    137-6 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Livy, lv., lvi., <hi rend="italic"
                    >BjτH.)∙,</hi> but the final subjugation cannot be placed earlier than the time
                    of Augustus. Under the Antonines, possibly even under Hadrian, Galløecia and
                    Asturia were erected into a separate Provincia Caesaris, having been regarded
                    previously as merely a portion of Lusitania. On the partition of Spain, which
                    followed the successful invasions of the Suevians, Alans, and Vandals, Gallaecia
                    fell to the lot of the first-named (411 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.b.</hi>). After
                    an independent subsistence of nearly 200 years, the Suevian kingdom was annexed
                    to the Visigothic dominions under Leovigild in 590. In 713 it was occupied by
                    the Moors, who in turn were driven out of it about the year 734 by Alphonso I.
                    of Asturias and his brother Froela. During the 9th and 10th centuries it was the
                    subject of dispute between more than one" count of Galicia and the suzerain, and
                    its coasts were repeatedly ravaged by the Norsemen. When Ferdinand I. divided
                    his kingdom among his sons in 1063, Galicia was the portion allotted to Garcia,
                    the youngest of the three. Ten years afterwards it was forcibly reannex*ed by
                    Garcia’s brother Alphonso, and thenceforward it remained an integral part of the
                    kingdom of Castile or of Leon. The honorary title of count of Galicia has
                    frequently be,en borne by younger sons of the Spanish sovereign. In the
                    patriotic struggles of 1808 the junta of Galicia took an important part. For
                    administrative purposes the ancient province has since 1833 been divided into
                    four, namely, Coruna, Lugo, Orense, and Pontevedra.</p>
