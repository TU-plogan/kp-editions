                <p><label type="entry">GARCILASO DE LA VEGA</label> (1503-1536), soldier and poet,
                    was born at Toledo in 1503. His father, Garcilaso (Garcias Laso or Garcilasso)
                    de la Vega, was counsellor of state to Ferdinand and Isabella, and for some time
                    their ambassador at the court of Rome; by his mother he was descended from the
                    illustrious house of Guzman. At the age of seventeen he received a military
                    appointment as α “continu” or guardsman to Charles V., and in that capacity took
                    part in the war against the insurgent comuneros, having been present at the
                    battle of Olias near Toledo, where he received a wound in the face. He
                    afterwards served in the north of Italy, and gained great distinction by his
                    bravery, particularly at the battle of Pavia in 1525. His marriage with a lady
                    of the household of Queen Eleanor, which took place in the following year,
                    suspended only for a very short time his activity in military and diplomatic
                    employments; he took part in the repulse of the Turks from Vienna in 1529, was
                    present at the splendid ceremonial connected with the coronation of the emperor
                    at Bologna in 1530, and was charged with a secret mission to Paris in autumn of
                    the same year. In 1531 he accompanied the duke of Alva to Vienna, where, for
                    having been in some way privy to the clandestine marriage of his nephew to one
                    of the ladies of the court, he was imprisoned for some months on an island in
                    the Danube. It was during this captivity that he composed the fine “cancion”
                    commencing “Con un manso ruido de agua corriente y clara.” Released and restored
                    to favour in June 1532, he at once went to Naples on the staff of Don Pedro de
                    Toledo, the newly-appointed viceroy, by whom he was twice sent on public
                    business of importance to Barcelona, in 1533 and in 1534. After having
                    accompanied the emperor on his Tunis expedition in 1535, where he fought bravely
                    and received two severe wounds, he was employed as a confidential agent at Milan
                    and Genoa in negotiations connected with the proposed invasion of Provence, and
                    afterwards joined the expedition itself when it took the field. Being with
                    Charles in the neighbourhood of Fréjus during the retreat from Marseilles,
                    Garcilaso de la Vega was ordered to silence a small fort at the village of Muy,
                    which had been harassing the movements of the army. In the successful discharge
                    of this duty he received a wound on the head which, twenty-one days afterwards,
                    at Nice, proved fatal (October 14, 1536). His literary remains, few in number,
                    but destined to exert a powerful influence on the subsequent development of the
                    poetry and general literature of his native country, were committed to the
                    charge of his friend Boscan, who was preparing them for publication along with
                    his own when death overtook him in 1540. The volume ultimately appeared at
                    Barcelona in 1543, and has often been reprinted. Garcilaso’s share in it
                    consists principally of three <hi rend="italic">eglogas</hi> or pastorals, which
                    the Spaniards regard as among the finest works of the kind in their language,
                    and which for sweetness of versification and delicacy of expression take a high
                    rank in modern European literature. In addition to the pastorals, there are
                    thirtyseven sonnets, five canciones, two elegies, and an epistle in versi
                    sciolti, in all of which the influence of Boscan is plainly felt, as well as
                    that of the Italian models whom both poets avowedly imitated, Petrarch, Bembo,
                    Ariosto, and Sannazaro. The poems rapidly gained a wide popularity; and within a
                    century of their appearance they had been edited and commented on as classics by
                    Sanchez, Herrera, and Tamayo de Vargas. “Imitated by Lope de Vega in every
                    possible way, praised more and cited oftener than any other poet by the genius
                    of Cervantes, Garcilaso de la Vega has come down to us enjoying a general
                    national admiration such as is given to hardly any other Spanish poet, and to
                    none that lived before his time” (Ticknor). An English translation of his works
                    was published by Wiffen in 1823.</p>
