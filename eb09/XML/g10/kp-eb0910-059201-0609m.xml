                    elected a senior fellow of his college. After leaving the university he went to
                    the Continent, and, on his return in 1573, settled in London, where for thirty
                    years,—that is, till his death, —he practised as a physician with “great success
                    and applause.” He was admitted to the College of Physicians, and filled various
                    offices in it. He began in 1581 as censor, which duty he discharged for several
                    years; then he became treasurer, consiliarius elect, and, at last, president in
                    1600. His professional skill and general ability drew the attention of Queen
                    Elizabeth, to him, and she appointed him royal physician. She also settled a
                    pension on him to enable him to prosecute the scientific inquiries to which he
                    was devoted. After this Gilbert seems to have removed to the court, and to have
                    vacated his house, which was “on St Peter’s Hill, between Upper Thames Street
                    and Little Knight-Rider Street.” At this house he seems to have had a society or
                    college, which was broken up and the members dispersed by his promotion. In the
                    year 1600 he published his work on the magnet. In 1603 the queen died, but
                    Gilbert was reappointed by her successor. He did not long enjoy the honour,
                    -however, for he died November 30, 1603, some say at Colchester, others at
                    London. He was buried at Colchester, in the chancel of the church of the Holy
                    Trinity, where a monument was erected to him. To the College of Physicians he
                    bequeathed his books, instruments, and minerals, but he gave his portrait to the
                    School Gallery at Oxford. In it he is represented as tall of stature and of
                    cheerful countenance, “holding in his hand a globe inscribed ‘Terella’; over his
                    head is the inscription ‘1591, aetatis 48;’ and a little below his left
                    shoulder, ‘Magneticarum virtutum primus indagator Gilbertus.’” The date thus
                    given does not tally with the conclusion of the inscription on his tombstone:
                    “Obiit anno Redemptionis Humanae 1603, Novembris ultimo, aetatis suae 63.” If
                    the latter be correct, he was born in 1540; if the former, in 1543.</p>
                <p>Gilbert’s principal work is his treatise on magnetism, entitled De Magnete,
                    Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure, London, 1600 (later
                    editions—Sedan, 1628, 1633; Frankfort, 1629, 1638). The merit of this work
                    consists in its originality, containing, as it does, an account of the author’s
                    experiments on magnets and magnetical bodies, and also the great discovery that
                    the whole earth is nothing but a large magnet, and that it is this which
                    explains, not only the direction of the magnetic needle north and south, but
                    also the variation and dipping or inclination of the needle. Gilbert’s is
                    therefore, not merely the first, but the most important systematic contribution
                    to the science of magnetism, and its merits were freely acknowledged by his
                    contemporaries. A posthumous work of Gilbert’s was edited by his brother, also
                    called William, from two MSS. in the possession of Sir William Boswell; its
                    title is De Mundo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova (Amsterdam, 1651). He is the
                    reputed inventor besides of two instruments to enable sailors “to find out the
                    latitude without seeing of sun, moon, or stars.” An account of these instruments
                    is given in Thomas Blondeville's Théoriques of the Planets (London, 1602). The
                    only writing of Gilbert in English is a short epistle addressed to William
                    Barlowe, printed at the end of his little work entitled Magneticall
                    Advertisements (London, 1616),—a letter -which has hitherto escaped the notice
                    of all the writers about Gilbert. It is of interest both because it shows that
                    he carried on a scientific correspondence with the Continent, and that his book
                    had been very well received, and because he says that he was intending to add
                    six or eight sheets to the book,—an intention, however, which was never earned
                    into effect. The letter is dated 14th February, unfortunately without the year,
                    but it must have been written between 1600 and 1603. In his preface Barlowe says
                    that he had numerous letters from Gilbert, but these have long since
                    disappeared. It is a matter of great regret for the historian of chemistry that
                    Gilbert left nothing on that branch of science, to which he was deeply devoted,
                    “attaining to great exactness therein.” So at least says Fuller, who, in his
                    Worthies of England (among whom he includes Gilbert), prophesied truly how he
                    would be afterwards known: “Mahomet’s tomb at Mecha,” he says, “is said
                    strangely to hang up, attracted by some invisible loadstone; but the memory of
                    this doctor will never fall to the ground, which his incomparable book De
                    Magnete will support to eternity.”</p>
