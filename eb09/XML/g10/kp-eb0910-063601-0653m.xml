                <p><label type="entry">GLARUS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Glaris</hi></label>, a canton
                    of Switzerland, is bounded on the N. and N.E. by St Gall, on the E. and S. by
                    the Grisons, and on the W. by Uri and Schwyz. Its area is 266 or 267 square
                    miles, its greatest length about 33 miles, and its greatest breadth about 16. A
                    thoroughly Alpine district, sloping northwards from the lofty range which
                    comprises the Tödi (11,887 feet), the Biferten Stock (11,237), and the Scheibe
                    (9587), and including within its limits the Glärnisch (9584) and the Mürtschen
                    Stock(8012), Glarus is almost completely cut off from the neighbouring cantous,
                    except towards the south. Of the three passes, the Segnes, the Kisten, and the
                    Panix, which communicate with the Grisons, the first and second are over the
                    snow, and the third has only a bridle path; and the Klausen pass and the Pragel
                    pass, which conduct respectively to Schwyz and Uri, have also mere bridle paths.
                    As far as it is a habitable country it may be said to consist of the valley of
                    the Linth, which extends from the Tödi southward to the Wallenstadt Lake along
                    with the lesser valleys of the Sernf (or Sernft) and the Klön, which branch off
                    to the east and the west. The climate, it need hardly be said, is a severe one,
                    the snow generally remaining, even in the lowlands, till near the beginning of
                    May. The föhn at times blows with terrific violence; and, by a law enforced in
                    the town of Glarus, every fire in the place must be extinguished as soon as it
                    sets in. The chief sources of wealth in the canton are the pastures and the
                    manufacturing industries. Though copper, silver, and iron mines were formerly
                    wrought, the only mineral production now of commercial importance is slate,
                    which is extensively quarried in the Plattenberg. Not more than a fifth of the
                    soil is capable of cultivation by the plough, and the agricultural produce has
                    consequently to be supplemented by foreign supplies. About 9000 or 10,000 head
                    of cattle are pastured in the canton, and according to the census of 1876 there
                    are 2000 sheep, 6900 goats, and 3000 swine. Neither butter nor ordinary cheese
                    is made in sufficient quantities for the local consumption, but the <hi

                    rend="italic">Kräuterkäse,</hi><hi rend="italic">Qτ</hi> “green cheese,” made of
                    skim milk, whether of goats or cows, mixed with butter-milk and coloured with
                    powdered <hi rend="italic">Steinklee</hi><hi rend="italic">(flelilotus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coerulea),</hi> is still largely manufactured. The curd is brought
                    down from the mountain chalet3 in sacks, which contain about 200 ft&gt; each.
                    After being ground for about 2 j hours in a mill along with the <hi
                    rend="italic">klee</hi> powder, which is added in the proportion of 3 ft&gt; to
                    the 100, the curd is put into shapes, and pressed in the usual way. It grows
                    ripe in about a year and keeps a long time. Large quantities are exported to
                    America. The cotton manufacture is the staple of the canton, and gives support
                    to about a fourth of the population. Formerly distributed through the country as
                    a domestic industry, it is now concentrated in a few factory towns and villages,
                    which in the aggregate keep about 250,000 spindles going. The cotton goods are
                    sent to the East, America, and Africa. It is not only in their own little
                    country that the people of Glarus find a field for their energies; they have
                    contributed to the industries of many parts of Europe, and their poorer
                    emigrants have founded three flourishing settlements in Wisconsin—New Glarus,
                    Vilten, and New Elm. The population, which in 1851 was 30,213, had increased by
                    1870 to 35,150, and was estimated in 1876 at 36,179. The vast majority are
                    Protestarts, only 6,888 being Catholics according to the census of 1870. The
                    constitution of Glarus is of the simplest kind, and extremely democratic.
                    According to the law of 1842, revised and sanctioned by the federal council in
                    1851, the government rests in the hands of a Landesgemeinde or assembly of the
                    whole male population above the age of eighteen, which usually meets on the
                    first Sunday in May, and elects the cantonal officials, votes the income and
                    poll-taxes, and passes or rejects any laws that may be presented by the cantonal
                    council or Landesrath. The cantonal council consists of 117 members. A council
                    of 45 members, and a committee of 9 members have control of the executive. The
                    landamman is president of the committee, the executive council, the cantonal
                    council, and the assembly. Justice is administered by five courts completely
                    independent of the Government. Freedom of the press, freedom of religious
                    worship, and freedom of trade and industry are all guaranteed. Aliens are
                    readily naturalized and admitted to the rights of citizens. The canton is
                    divided into 25 communes, only one of which, that of Glarus, has more than 5000
                    inhabitants, while 16 have less than 1000, and the smallest has only 231.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Glarus,</hi> the capital of the canton, is a flourishing
                    little town on the left bank of the Linth, about 1495 feet above the sea-level.
                    Its environment is a remarkable one: to the S. the Glärnisch rises 6153 feet; to
                    the N.W. the Wiggis, 6033; and to the E. the Schild, 6010. The fire of 1861
                    devastated the greater part of the town, destroying its Gothic church of the
                    10th century, the casino, the Government houses, and all its principal
                    buildings; 2000 of the inhabitants were rendered houseless, and property to the
                    value of 8,000,000 francs was destroyed. Contributions however were sent in from
                    far and near to the amount of 2,754,606 francs, the federal authorities of
                    Switzerland voted a loan of 1,000,000 at two per cent., and the canton furnished
                    a subsidy at 3 per cent.; the town was rapidly rebuilt in a substantial and
                    regular style, and the public edifices restored. The church is used in common by
                    the Protestants and the Roman Catholics. The high school accommodates 700
                    pupils. Most of the population, which in 1870 numbered 5516, are supported by
                    the cotton manufacture carried on in the town and the vicinity. A certain trace
                    of rustic life is still maintained, as the operatives have each a bit of ground
                    in the “almend.” On the opposite side of the river lies the industrial village
                    of Enneda.</p>
                <p>In the end of the 5th century an Irisn monk, Fridolin, the founder of the convent
                    of Seckingen on the Rhine, built a church on the site of the present town, and
                    the name of St Hilarius, which he gave it in honour of his patron the bishop of
                    Poitiers, in course of time became corrupted to Glarus or Glaris. The whole
                    valley was reckoned to the estates of the abbey of Seckingen, and it was
                    governed by a mayor or bailiff whose nomination was vested ultimately in the
                    Hapsburg family. The tyranny of these officers constrained the people of Glarus
                    to join the Helvetic confederation in 1352, and in 1388 they secured their
                    independence by a victory over the Austrians at Näfels, the anniversary of which
                    is still celebrated on the second Thursday of April. Zwingli the Reformer was
                    curate of Glarus from 1506 to 1516, and by 1530 the new doctrines had been
                    accepted by five-sixths of the population of the canton. The two religious
                    parties, though they were happily prevented from appealing to arms, continued
                    long in a state of mutual alienation and suspicion; the Protestants, for
                    example, would have nothing to do with the Gregorian calendar because it was
                    introduced by the papal party. At length a settlement of a peculiar kind was
                    effected in 1683. Each confession was allowed to have a cantonal assembly, a
                    cantonal council, and officials of its own; while for all matters in which both
                    parties were interested there was a cantonal assembly and a cantonal council for
                    discussion and administration in common. It was in the beginning of the 18th
                    century that the present prosperity of the canton received its original impulse.
                    Cottonspinning was introduced in 1712 by Heidegger of Zurich, and weaving and
                    calico-printing followed before 1750. The population of the canton increased
                    from 15,000 to 20,000 during the century. The effects of the great Revolution
                    were beneficially experienced,-and the early part of the 19th century was marked
                    by numerous improvements, political and social. Till 1811 the lower course of
                    the Linth was extremely irregular, and its inundations had gradually turned a
                    large stretch of country into a swamp; but, under the patronage and direction
                    mainly of Escher (von der Linth, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n654/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0654-0637"/> as he came afterwards to be called), there was
                    constructed a magnificent system of canals which completely remedied the evils,
                    and the desolate region soon became one of the finest parts of the canton. The
                    whole cost of the works up till 1823 was 974,553 francs. When the new
                    constitution of 1836 was introduced, the Roman Catholic minority, whose
                    influence it greatly diminished, were urged on by Bossi, the bishop of Chur
                    (Coire), to break off from their Protestant countrymen; but the Government
                    expelled the few priests who refused to take the oath, and separated the canton
                    from its connexion with the diocese of Chur. After Bossi’s death the decree of
                    separation λvas revoked. In the Sonderbund war of 1847 Glarus was true to the
                    federation; and the same spirit was shown in the voting about the constitution
                    in 1872-75.</p>
