                    jurists or historians.</p>
                <p>The first whose name is associated with the active study of jurisprudence, at the

                    retired to Basel. Thence he was induced by the offer of a chair of Roman law to
                    go to Strasburg, but soon changed his appointment for one at Λltorf, which then
                    pos∙ sessed a university celebrated for its late professor of law, Donneau. In
                    1600 the elector palatine appointed him professor of Roman law in Heidelberg,
                    where he spent the greater portion of the remainder of his life, and was placed
                    at the head of the faculty of law. The most flattering offers from several
                    universities failed to induce him to leave his adopted country, but the invasion
                    of the Palatinate by Tilly’s troops forced him to take refuge again at
                    Strasburg, where he died in 1621. His most important work is his edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris.</hi> The text given by him was very generally
                    adopted and used in quotation. More than twenty editions of the work were
                    published in various towns of France, Germany, and Holland. Godefroy’s other
                    writings are very numerous; but they are for the most part either editions of
                    classical authors or compilations which display great industry and learning, but
                    are of little use to the modern student.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theodore</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Godefroy</hi> (1580-1649),
                    the eldest son of Denis, forsook the religion which his father had adopted, and
                    obtained the office of historiographer of France, as well as several important
                    diplomatic posts. His historical works are very numerous. The character of his
                    labours will be judged from the title of his most elaborate production— <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Ceremonial de Prance.</hi> Many of his
                    smaller works are devoted to questions of genealogy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jacques Godefroy</hi> (1587-1652), the younger brother of
                    Theodore, has a real claim to the remembrance of students of the history of
                    Roman law, in his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Theodosiaη Code,</hi> at
                    which he laboured for thirty years. It was this code, and not the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi> prepared under the direction of Justinian, which
                    formed the principal, though not the only source from which the lawyers of the
                    various countries which had formed the Western empire drew their knowledge of
                    Roman law, at all events until the revival of the study of law in the 11th
                    century at Bologna. Hence Godefroy’s edition was of real value. Jacques Godefroy
                    also completed the difficult and useful task of collecting and arranging those
                    fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi> which can be discovered,
                    and so an important step was taken towards representing the Roman law in its
                    first definite form. His other works are very numerous, and are principally
                    devoted to the discussion of various points of Roman law. He died in 1652,
                    having served the republic of Geneva both as its principal magistrate and in
                    undertaking important missions to the court of France.</p>

                    activity extends over a period of nearly 200 years, may be found in the <hi
