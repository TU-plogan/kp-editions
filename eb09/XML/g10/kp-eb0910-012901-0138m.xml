                    January 12, 1783, of a family that had immigrated from Austria iu the time of
                    Gustavus Adolphus. At sixteen he left Carlstad gymnasium for the university of
                    Upsala, where in 1803 he carried off the Swedish Academy’s great prize for an
                    <hi rend="italic">Äreminne</hi><hi rend="italic">ofver Riksforstandareη</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sten Sture.</hi> He graduated in 1806, and in 1810 returned from a
                    year’s residence in England to become “docent” in his university. Soon
                    afterwards he accepted a post in the public record office at. Stockholm, where,
                    with eleven friends, he founded the “Gothic Society,” to whose organ <hi
                    rend="italic">Iduna</hi> he contributed a number of prose essays and the songs
                    <hi rend="italic">Manhem, Vikingen, Den</hi><hi rend="italic">siste</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">kampen, Den</hi><hi rend="italic">siste</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >skalden, Odalbοnden, Kolar-gossen,</hi> and others, whose simplicity and
                    earnestness, warm feeling, and strong patriotic spirit are dearer to his nation
                    for fine melodies to which he set them. About the same time he issued a volume
                    of hymns (1812), of which several are inserted in the Swedish Psalter. Geijer’s
                    lyric muse was soon after silenced by his call to be assistant to Fant,
                    professor of history of Upsala (1815), whom he succeeded in that chair in 1817.
                    In 1824 he was elected to the Swedish Academy. A single volume of a great
                    projected work, <hi rend="italic">Svea Rikes Häfder,</hi> itself a masterly
                    critical examination of the sources of Sweden’s legendary history, appeared in
                    1825. Geijer’s researches in its preparation had severely strained his health,
                    and he went the same year on a tour through Denmark and part of Germany, his
                    impressions from which are recorded in his <hi rend="italic">Minnen</hi> (1834).
                    In 1832-36 he published three volumes of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Svenskafolkets</hi><hi rend="italic">historia,</hi> a clear view of the
                    political and social development of Sweden down to the close of Queen
                    Christina’s reign. The acute critical insight, just thought, and finished
                    historical art of these two incomplete works of Geijer entitle him to the first
                    place among Swedish historians. His chief other historical and political
                    writings are his <hi rend="italic">Kort teckning αf Sυeriges tillstand</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">och</hi><hi rend="italic">af de</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">historia</hi> (1844), which led to a controversy with the
                    historian Fryxell regarding the part played in history by the Swedish
                    aristocracy. Geijer also edited, with the aid of Schröder, a continuation of
                    Fant’s <hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi><hi rend="italic">svecicarum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">medii</hi><hi rend="italic">oevi</hi> (1818— 25), and, by himself,
                    Thorild’s <hi rend="italic">Samlade skrfter</hi> (1819-25), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Koηung Gustaf IIL</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s efterlemnade</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Papper</hi> (3 vols. 1843-45). Geijer’s academic lectures, of

                    var tids inre samhaUsforhαllaηdeη, i synnerhet med afseende pa
                    Faderηes-landet,</hi> involved him in another controversy with Fryxell,
                    exercised a great influence over his students, who especially testified to their
                    attachment after the failure of the prosecution for alleged anti-Trinitarian
                    heresies in his <hi rend="italic">Thorild, tillika</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">philosophisk eller ophilosophisk</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bekännelse</hi> (1820). A number of his extempore lectures, recovered from
                    notes, were published by Ribbing in 1856. Failing health forced Geijer to resign
                    his chair in 1846, after which he removed to Stockholm for the purpose of
                    completing his <hi rend="italic">Svenska folkets</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >historia,</hi> and died there 23d April 1847. His <hi rend="italic">Samlade
                    skrifter</hi> (13 vols. 1849-55; new ed. 1873-75) include a large number of
                    philosophical and political essays contributed to reviews, particularly to <hi
                    rend="italic">Literal·ivrbladet</hi> (1838-39), a periodical edited by himself,
                    which attracted great attention in its day by its pronounced liberal views on
                    public, questions, a striking contrast to those he had defended in 1828-30,
                    when, as again in 1840-41, he represented Upsala university in the Swedish
                    diet.</p>
                <p>Geijer’s style is strong and manly. His genius bursts out in sudden flashes that
                    light up the dark corners of history. A few strokes, and a personality stands
                    before us instinct with life. His language is at once the scholar’s and the
                    poet’s; with his profoundest thought there beats in unison the warmest, the
                    noblest, the most patriotic heart. Geijer came to the writing of history fresh
                    from researches in the whole field of Scandinavian antiquity, researches whose
                    first-fruits are garnered in numerous articles in <hi rend="italic">Idηna,</hi>
                    and his masterly treatise <hi rend="italic">Cm den gamla nordiska
                    folk-visan,</hi> prefixed to the collection of <hi rend="italic">Svenska
                    folkvisor</hi> which he edited with A. A. Afzelius (3 vols. 1814-16). The
                    development of freedom is the idea that gives unity to all his historical
                    writings. This idea is not subjective; he traces it in the darkest annals of his
                    country. Sweden, he repeats, is the only European land that has not been trod by
                    foreign armies, that has never accepted the yoke of serfdom. There, on the
                    whole, the king has ever been the people’s faithfullest ally, and all his great
                    designs for the country’s external and internal gain have been carried out “by
                    the help of God and Sweden.” Throughout life Geijer was what he professed to be,
                    a seeker; and to no philosophic system did he yield absolute allegiance. Yet his
                    writings mark a new era in Swedish history, the rise of a “critical school”
                    whose aim is to draw the truth without distortion, and present reality without a
                    foil.</p>
