                    (1770-1837), was born on May 4, 1770, at Rome, where his father occupied a post
                    in the house of the French ambassador. At the age of twelve Gérard left Rome
                    with his family for Paris, and there obtained admission into the Pension du Roi.
                    From the Pension he passed to the studio of Pajou (sculptor), which he left at
                    the end of two years for that of the painter Brenet, whom he quitted almost
                    immediately to place himself under David. In 1789 Gérard competed for the Prix
                    de Rome, which was carried off by his comrade Girodet. In the following year
                    (1790) he again presented himself, but the death of his father prevented the
                    completion of his work, and obliged him to accompany his mother to Rome.</p>
                <p>In 1791 he returned to Paris; but his poverty was so great that he was forced to
                    forego his studies in favour of employment which should bring in immediate
                    profit. David at once availed himself of his help, and one of that master’s most
                    celebrated portraits—Le Pelletier de St Fargeau—is due to the hand of “le petit
                    Gérard.” This portrait was executed early in 1793, the year in which Gérard, at
                    the request of David, was named a member of the revolutionary tribunal, from the
                    fatal decisions of which he, however, invariably absented himself. In 1794 he
                    obtained the first prize in a competition, the subject of which was “The Tenth
                    of August,” and, further stimulated by the successes of his rival and friend
                    Girodet in the Salons of 1793 and 1794, Gérard (nobly aided by Isabey the
                    miniaturist) produced in 1795 his famous “Bélisaire.” In 1796 a portrait of his
                    generous friend (Louvre) obtained undisputed success, and the money received
                    from Isabey for these two works enabled Gérard to execute in 1797 his “Psyche et
                    1’Amour.” At last, in 1799, his portrait of Madame Bonaparte established his
                    position as one of the first portrait painters of the day. In 1808 as many as
                    eight, in 1810 no less than fourteen portraits by him, were exhibited at the
                    Salon, and these figures afford only an indication of the enormous numbers which
                    he executed yearly; all the leading figures of the empire and of the
                    restoration, all the most celebrated men and women of Europe, sat to Gérard.
                    This extraordinary vogue was due partly to the charm of his manner and
                    conversation, for his <hi rend="italic">salon</hi> was as much frequented as his
                    studio; Madame de Stael, Canning, Talleyrand, the duke of Wellington, have all
                    borne witness to the attraction of his society. Rich and famous, Gérard was
                    stung by remorse for earlier ambitions abandoned; at intervals he had indeed
                    striven to prove his strength with Girodet and other rivals, and his “Bataille
                    d’Austerlitz” (1810) showed a breadth of invention and style which are even more
                    conspicuous in “L’Entrée d’Henri IV.” (Versailles),—the work with which in 1817
                    he did homage to the Bourbons. After this date Gérard declined, watching with
                    impotent grief the progress of the Romantic school. Loaded with honours—baron of
                    the empire, member of the Institute, officer of the legion of honour, first
                    painter to the king—he worked on sad and discouraged; the revolution of 1830
                    added to his disquiet; and in 1837 on 11th January, after three days of fever,
                    he died. By his portraits Gérard is best remembered; the colour of his paintings
                    has suffered, but his drawings show in uninjured delicacy the purity of his
                    line; and those of women are specially remarkable for a virginal simplicity and
                    frankness of expression.</p>
