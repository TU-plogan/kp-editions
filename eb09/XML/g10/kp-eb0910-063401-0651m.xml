                <p><label type="entry">GLANDERS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Equinia</hi></label>, a
                    specific infectious disease to which certain animals, chiefly those possessing
                    an undivided hoof, are liable, and which is communicable from them to man. The
                    term farcy is also employed to designate a variety of this affection, but there
                    is no pathological distinction between the two. The disease as it affects
                    animals belongs to the subject of Veterinary Medicine.</p>
                <p>Glanders is happily a rare form of disease in man, there being evidently less
                    affinity for its development in the human subject than in the equine species. It
                    occurs chiefly among those who from their occupation are fre quently in contact
                    with horses, such as grooms, coachmen, cavalry soldiers, veterinary surgeons,
                    &amp;c., and seems always produced either by direct inoculation of the virus
                    from a diseased animal into the broken skin, or by the respiration of air
                    containing the poison. It is said to have occasionally been transmitted from man
                    to man, but such an occurrence is extremely rare.</p>
                <p>A period of incubation, lasting from three to five days, generally follows the
                    introduction of the virus into the system. This period, however, appears
                    sometimes to be of much longer duration, especially where there has been no
                    direct inoculation of the poison. The first symptoms are a general feeling of
                    illness, accompanied with pains in the limbs and joints resembling those of
                    acute rheumatism. If the disease has been introduced by means of an abraded
                    surface, pain is felt at that point, and inflammatory swelling takes place
                    there, and extends along the neighbouring lymphatics. An ulcer is formed at the
                    point of inoculation which dischargesan offensive ichor, and blebsappear in the
                    inflamed skin, along with diffuse abscesses, as in phlegmonous erysipelas.
                    Sometimes the disease stops short with these local manifestations, but more
                    commonly goes on rapidly accompanied with symptoms of grave constitutional
                    disturbance. Over the whole surface of the body there appear numerous red spots
                    or pustules, which break and discharge <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0652-0635"/> a thick mucous or sanguineous fluid. Besides
                    these there are larger swellings lyiug deeper in the subcutaneous tissue, which
                    at first are extremely hard and painful, and to which the term farcy “buds” or
                    “buttons” is applied. These ultimately open and become extensive sloughing
                    ulcers.</p>
                <p>The mucous membranes participate in the same lesions as are present in the skin,
                    and this is particularly the case with the interior of the nose, where indeed,
                    in many instances, the disease first of all shows itself. This organ becomes
                    greatly swollen and inflamed, while from one or both nostrils there exudes a
                    copious discharge of highly offensive purulent or sanguineous matter. The lining
                    membrane of the nostrils is covered with papules similar in character to those
                    on the skin, which form ulcers, and may lead to the destruction of the
                    cartilaginous and bony textures of the nose. The diseased action extends into
                    the throat, mouth, and eyes, while the whole face becomes swollen and
                    erysipelatous, and the lymphatic glands under the jaws inflame and suppurate.
                    Not unfrequently the bronchial tubes become affected, and cough attended with
                    expectoration of matter similar to that discharged from the nose is the
                    consequence. The general constitutional symptoms are exceedingly severe, and
                    advance with great rapidity, the patient passing into a state of extreme
                    prostration. In the acute form of the disease recovery rarely if ever occurs,
                    and the case generally terminates fatally in a period varying from two or three
                    days to as many weeks.</p>
                <p>A chronic form of glanders and farcy is occasionally met with, in which the
                    symptoms, although essentially the same as those above described, advance much
                    more slowly, and are attended with relatively less urgent constitutional
                    disturbance. Cases of recovery from this form are on record; but in general the
                    disease ultimately proves fatal by exhaustion of the patient, or by a sudden
                    supervention, which is apt to occur, of the acute form. On the other hand, acute
                    glanders is never observed to become chronic.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of this malady the main reliance is to be placed on the
                    maintenance of the patient’s strength by strong nourishment and tonic remedies.
                    If the point of inoculation of the virus can be early made out, its active
                    cauterization, as in the case of any poisoned wound, should be resorted to. The
                    opening of abscesses antiseptically, as well as the use of antiseptic lotions
                    for the affected mucous membranes, is recommended. In all cases of the outbreak
                    of glanders it is of the utmost consequence to prevent the spread of the disease
                    by the destruction of affected animals, and the cleansing and disinfection of
                    infected localities.</p>
