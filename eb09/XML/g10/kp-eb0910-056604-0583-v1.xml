                    the Russian district of Talish by the Λstara, and bounded W. by Azerbijan, S. by
                    Irak Adjemi, and S.E. by Mazanderan. It is about 150 miles in length, with a
                    breadth varying from 15 to 50 miles; and its area is estimated at from 4500 to

                    in by the mountains of the Elburz range; and though the Kyzyl Usen, which has
                    its sources in the mountains of Kurdistan, is the only river of any size, the
                    country is abundantly watered, and vast stretches of swamp are found in various
                    directions. This is mainly due to the character of the climate, which is
                    distinguished by a very heavy precipitation both in winter and summer.
                    Vegetation is almost tropically luxuriant, and the forests are as dense as an
                    Indian jungle. Oaks, maples, ash trees, <hi rend="italic">planeras,</hi> lime
                    trees, and <hi rend="italic">parrottias,</hi> are among the prevailing types.
                    The chestnut-leaved oak attains colossal proportions, and a height at times of
                    130 or 140 feet; and the box tree comes to rare perfection, and forms an
                    important source of wealth. Vines and pomegranates, walnuts, plums, pears, and
                    apples grow wild; and oranges, lemons, peaches, and other fruits are easily
                    cultivated, though sometimes a severe winter proves fatal to the trees. The
                    olive succeeds well in the valley of the Sefudrood, but the oil is extracted in
                    a very primitive manner. Rice is largely cultivated, and forms the principal
                    food of the inhabitants, except in the west, where its place is partially taken
                    by wheat, a cereal indeed to which the Ghilanese farmer is more and more
                    directing his attention. Cotton and sugar are both grown in small quantities,
                    and the character of the climate gives reason to hope that tea plantations may
                    be rendered profitable in some districts. Hitherto the most successful
                    occupation has been silk-growing; but frequent failures in the crop have
                    disheartened, if they have not ruined, many of the silk-masters. The quantity
                    produced in 1866 was valued at £743,300, while the average between 1870 and 1875
                    was only about £270,000. In quality the silk does not rank very high, the
                    greater portion being the produce of Japanese seed. Animal life is nearly as
                    well represented in Ghilan as vegetable life. Tigers, wild boars, deer, and a
                    considerable variety of snakes are found in the jungles; pheasants are a common
                    form of game; aquatic bi rds of various kinds—pelicans, storks, heron, gulls,
                    ducks, &amp;c., swarm along the coast; and the fisheries in the Caspian are
                    highly productive. The ordinary cattle, a small humped species like that of
                    India, form an article of export; sheep and goats are not so plentiful, but they
                    furnish very fine wool; and the horses are a hardy race, greatly prized in other
                    parts of Persia, and especially in the capital. Wild horses are to be met with
                    in the forests. Trade and commerce are in a very undeveloped state,—and no
                    wonder when, with one trifling exception, there is no carriageable road in the
                    province, and merchandise has to be transported on the backs of horses, mules,
                    or camels. A striking instance of the primitive state of matters is furnished by
                    Mr Mounsey, who tells how the machinery ordered by the Shah from Europe for his
                    new mint was allowed to go to ruin in the sand at Enzelli, because it was found
                    impossible to provide for its conveyance. The port of Enzelli, though it boasts
                    of a lighthouse and three small forts, is little more than a natural harbour,
                    and in rough weather it is not accessible to the mail steamers, which in the
                    ordinary course call once a week.</p>
                <p>The administration of the province is nearly as primitive as its system of roads,
                    and consists of nothing but machinery for the collection of the taxes, which
                    yield about £63,000 to the royal revenue. The capital is Resht, and the
                    administrative districts are Resht, Lahijan, Fomen, Gesku, Talishan, Sheft,
                    Rustemabad, Rudbar, Menjech, Lengerood, Siah Kuh, and Dilman. Every able-bodied
                    man is enrolled in a sort of frontier guard in the district of Talishan, but no
                    regular police is maintained throughout the province. The population is of very
                    various composition; but the main stock, including the Tats and the Gileki, is
                    of Iranian origin. The Gilek is strongly built, but lank, and his complexion is
                    a sort of olive or copper colour; the Tat, on the other hand, has a tendency to
                    corpulence, and his complexion is swarthy. According to different estimates, the
                    inhabitants of the province number 150,000, 200,000, or 275,000; but it is more
                    than usually difficult to ascertain the truth of the case, as they are for the
                    most part scattered through the country in small hamlets. Ghilan is part of the
                    ancient district of Hyrcania. The name is usually explained as equivalent to
                    Mud-land; but Spiegel objects to this derivation, and says the true form of the
                    word is Gelan, which has received no interpretation. There is nothing very
                    distinctive about the history of the province; but its position, its climate,
                    and its soil should secure it a flourishing future were its political condition
                    improved.</p>
