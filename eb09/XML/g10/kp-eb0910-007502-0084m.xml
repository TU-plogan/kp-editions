                    or 5 feet by the melting of the Alpine snow3 at the beginning of summer. The
                    greatest depths are about 900 or 1000 feet. At the northern extremity it
                    receives the waters of the Sarca, a comparatively small Tyrolese stream, and at
                    the south-eastern corner, at Peschiera, its surplus is conveyed by the Mincio to
                    the Po. Navigation on the one hand is frequently rendered dangerous by sudden
                    bursts of storm, while on the other hand it is facilitated by the two regular
                    winds called the Ora or Andar and the Sover, of which the former blows from the
                    south from midday to midnight, and the latter from the north from midnight to
                    midday. Especially in its southern quarters, the lake is very rich in fish, the
                    more important species being the salmon-trout, the carpione <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Salmo punctatus),</hi> the trout, the sardina <hi rend="italic">(Alausa
                    vulgans),</hi> the eel, and the arvole. The principal towns and villages along
                    the Riviera or western side of the lake are—Desenzano, in the south; Salo, w⅛h
                    4500 inhabitants; Maderno, with 1500 inhabitants; Tos-colano, with 2000, famous
                    for its paper-mills, introduced in 1386; Gargnano, with 4000; Limone; and Riva,
                    at the northern extremity, with about 6000. Proceeding south along the eastern
                    side we find Torbole, Malcesine, Torri, Garda, which gives its name to the lake,
                    Lacize, and Peschiera. Desenzano and Torri are the chief seats of the fish
                    trade. Steamers ply regularly from Desenzano to Riva, and from Riva to
                    Peschiera. The scenery of the Garda is not so fine as that of the Lake of Como,
                    but it is remarkable for the luxuriance of the vegetation, especially on the
                    beautiful promontory of Sirmione, which projects from the southern shore, and
                    still contains the ruins of the villa once inhabited by Catullus. The lemon
                    ripens its fruit at several places round the lake, though the trees require to
                    be carefully covered, and even artificially warmed, during the frosts. The whole
                    number is estimated at about 18,000, and each may produce about 1000 lemons.</p>
                <p>The lake was well known to the Romans as Benacus <hi rend="italic"

                    there must have been a town of its own name on the lake. According to a not
                    improbable hypothesis there was formerly a navigable channel from the Adriatic
                    to the Benacus; and we know from inscribed stones preserved in the Museo
                    Filarmonico of Peschiera (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Ardclica)</hi> that a

                    Roman period, it must at least have disappeared before the end of the 15th
                    century; for when in 1438 the Venetians wished to bring their vessels from the
                    Adige to the lake they conveyed them overland from the neighbourhood of Mori to
                    Torbole. This Herculean undertaking was proposed by Blasio de Arboribus and
                    Nicolo Sorbolo, and it was successfully accomplished at a cost of 15,000 ducats.
                    As early as 1827 a steamboat of 28 horse-power, the “Arciduca Ranieri,” was
                    launched on the lake at Desenzano by a Milan company; and in 1834 it was
                    superseded by another of 18 horse-power. In 1830 Francesco Montagni of Riva
                    built a boat, the “Manubrio,” the machinery of which was moved by 8 horses going
                    round and round on the deck; but in 1839 he gave it up as unprofitable. In 1873
                    there were four steamboats on the lake in tho service of the railway company of
                    Upper Italy, besides thirty-one vessels with a total tonnage of about 400 tons,
                    and about 500 fishing boats. The Italian Government also maintained four
                    gunboats at Peschiera.</p>
