                <p><label type="entry">GADDI</label>. Four painters of the early Florentine school—
                    father, son, and two grandsons—bore this name.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gaddo Gaddi</hi> (1239 to about 1312) was, according to
                    Va3ari, an intimate friend of Cimabue, and afterwards of Giotto. He was a
                    painter and mosaist, is said to have executed the great mosaic inside the portal
                    of the cathedral of Florence, representing the coronation of the Virgin, and may
                    with more certainty be credited with the mosaics inside the portico of the
                    basilica of S. Maria Maggiore, Rome, relating to the legend of the foundation of
                    that church; their date is probably 1308. In the original cathedral of St Peter
                    in Rome, he also executed the mosaics of the choir, and those of the front,
                    representing on a colossal scale God the Father, with many other figures;
                    likewise an altarpiece in the church of S. Maria Novella, Florence; these works
                    no longer exist. It is ordinarily held that no picture (as distinct from
                    mosaics) by Gaddo Gaddi is now extant. Messrs Crowe &amp; Cavalcaselle, however,
                    consider that the mosaics of S. Maria Maggiore bear so strong a resemblance in
                    style to four of the frescos in the upper church of Assisi, representing
                    incidents in the life of St Francis (frescos 2, 3, 4, and especially 5, which
                    shows Francis stripping himself, and protected by the bishop), that those
                    frescos likewise may, with considerable confidence, be ascribed to Gaddi. Some
                    other extant mosaics are attributed to him, but without full authentication.
                    This artist laid the foundation of a very large fortune, which continued
                    increasing, and placed his progeny in a highly distinguished worldly
                    position.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Taddeo Gaddi</hi> (about 1300-1366, or later), son of
                    Gaddo, was born in Florence, and became one of Giotto’s most industrious
                    assistants for a period (as usually stated) of 24 years. This can hardly be
                    other than an exaggeration; it is probable that he began painting on his own
                    account towards 1330, when Giotto went to Naples. Taddeo also traded as a
                    merchant, and had a branch establishment in Venice. He was a painter, mosaist,
                    and architect. He executed in fresco, in the Baroncelli (now Giugni) chapel, in
                    the Florentine church of S. Croce, the Virgin and Child between Four Prophets,
                    on the funeral monument at the entrance, and on the walls various incidents in
                    the legend of the Virgin, from the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple up to
                    the Nativity. In the subject of the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple are
                    the two heads traditionally accepted as portraits of Gaddo Gaddi and Andrea
                    Tafi; they cannot, at any rate, be portraits of those artists from the life. On
                    the ceiling of the same chapel are the Eight Virtues. In the museum of Berlin is
                    an altarpiece by Taddeo, the Virgin and Child and some other subjects, dated
                    1334; in the Naples Gallery, a triptych, dated 1336, of the Virgin enthroned
                    along with Four Saints, the Baptism of Jesus, and his Deposition from the Cross;
                    in the sacristy of S. Pietro a Megognano, near Poggibonsi, an altarpiece dated
                    1355, the Virgin and Child enthroned amid Angels. A series of paintings, partly
                    from the life of S. Francis, which Taddeo executed for the presses in S. Croce,
                    are now divided between the Florentine Academy and the Berlin Museum; the
                    compositions are taken from or founded on Giotto, to whom, indeed, the Berlin
                    authorities have ascribed their examples. Taddeo also paiuted some frescos still
                    extant in Pisa, besides many in S. Croce and other Florentine buildings, which
                    have perished. He deservedly ranks as one of the most eminent successors of
                    Giotto; it may be said that he continued working up the material furnished by
                    that great painter, with comparatively feeble inspiration of his own. His
                    figures are vehement in action, long and slender in form; his execution rapid
                    and somewhat conventional. To Taddeo are generally ascribed the celebrated
                    frescos—those of the ceiling and left or western wall—in the Cappella degli
                    Spagnuoli, in the church of S. Maria Novella, Florence; this is, however, open
                    to considerable doubt, although it may perhaps be conceded that the designs for
                    the ceiling were furnished by Taddeo. Dubious also are the three pictures
                    ascribed to him in the London National Gallery. As a mosaist, he has left some
                    work in the baptistery of Florence. As an architect, he supplied in 1336 the
                    plans for the present Ponte Vecchio, and those for the original (not the
                    present) Ponte S. Trinita; in 1337 he was engaged on the church of
                    Orsan-Michele; and he carried on after Giotto’s death the work of the unrivalled
                    Campanile.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Agnolo Gaddi,</hi> born in Florence, was the son of
                    Taddeo; the date of his birth has been given as 1326, but possibly 1350 is
                    nearer the mark. He was a painter and mosaist, trained by his father, and a
                    merchant as well; in middle age he settled down to commercial life in Venice,
                    and he added greatly to the family wealth. He died in October 1396. His
                    paintings show much early promise, hardly sustained as he advanced in life. One
                    of . the earliest, at S. Jacopo tra’ Fossi, Florence, represents the
                    Resurrection of Lazarus. Another probably youthful performance is the series of
                    frescos of the Pi eve di Prato— legends of the Virgin and of her Sacred Girdle,
                    bestowed upon St Thomas, and brought to Prato in the 11th century by Michele dei
                    Dagomari; the Marriage of Mary is one of the best of this series, the later
                    compositions in which have suffered much by renewals. In S. Croce he painted, in
                    eight frescos, the legend of the Cross, beginning with the Archangel Michael
                    giving Seth a branch from the tree of knowledge, and ending with the Emperor
                    Heraclius carrying the Cross as he enters Jerusalem; in this picture is a
                    portrait of the painter himself. Agnolo composed his subjects better than
                    Taddeo; he had more dignity and individuality in the figures, and was a clear
                    and bold colourist; the general effect is laudably decorative, but the drawing
                    is poor, and the works show best from a distance. Various other productions of
                    this master exist, and many have perished. Cennino Cennini, the author of the
                    celebrated treatise on painting, was one of his pupils.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Giovanni Gaddi,</hi> brother of Agnolo, was also a
                    painter of promise. He died young. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ. e.)</hi><pb
