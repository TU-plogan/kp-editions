                    (1628-1715), a sculptor whose works are typically characteristic of the epoch of
                    Louis XIV., was born at Troyes in 1628, and died in the Louvre in 1715. As a boy
                    he had for master a joiner and wood-carver of his native town, Baudesson by name
                        <hi rend="italic">(Arch. de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Français,</hi> V. 4), under whom he is said to have worked at
                    the château of Liébault, where he attracted the notice of Chancellor Séguier. By
                    the cliancellor’s influence Girardon wa3 first removed to Paris and placed in
                    the studio of François Anguier, and afterwards sent to Rome. In 1650 he returned
                    to France, and seems at once to have addressed himself with something like
                    ignoble subserviency to the task of conciliating Le Brun, who owed his start in
                    life to the same patron. Girardon is reported to have declared himself incapable
                    of composing a group, whether with truth or from motives of policy it is
                    impossible to say. This much is certain, that a very large proportion of his
                    work was carried out from designs by Le Brun, and shows the merits and defects
                    of Le Brun’s manner—a great command of ceremonial pomp in presenting his
                    subject, coupled with a large treatment of forms which if it were more
                    expressive might be imposing. The court which Girardon paid to the “premier
                    peintre du roi” was rewarded. An immense quantity of work at Versailles was
                    entrusted to him, and in recognition of the successful execution of four figures
                    for the Bains d’Apollon, Le Brun induced the king to present his*protegé
                    personally with a purse of 300 louis, as a distinguishing mark of royal favour.
                    In 1650 Girardon was made member of the Academy, in 1659 professor, in 1674
                    “adjoint au recteur,” and finally in 1695 chancellor. Five years before (1690),
                    on the death of Le Brun, he had also been appointed “inspecteur général des
                    ouvrages de sculpture”— a place of power and profit. In 1699 he completed the
                    bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV., erected by the town of Paris on the
                    Place Louis le Grand. This statue was melted down during the Revolution, and is
                    known to us only by a small bronze model (Louvre) finished by Girardon himself.
                    His Tomb of Richelieu (church of the Sorbonne) was saved from destruction by M.
                    Alexandre Lenoir, who received a bayonet thrust in protecting the head of the
                    cardinal from mutilation. It is a capital example of Girardon’s work; but
                    amongst other important specimens yet remaining may also be cited the Tomb of
                    Louvois (St Eustache), that of Bignon (St Nicolas du Chardonneret), and
                    decorative sculptures in the Galerie d’Apollon and Chambre du roi, in the
                    Louvre. Although chiefly occupied at Paris, Girardon never forgot his native
                    Troyes. In the Hôtel de Ville is still shown a medallion of Louis XIV., and in
                    the church of St Rémy a bronze crucifix of some importance,— both works by his
                    hand. In 1850 Μ. Corrard de Breban, who has given much time to researches
                    concerning artists native to the town of Troyes, published a <hi rend="italic"
