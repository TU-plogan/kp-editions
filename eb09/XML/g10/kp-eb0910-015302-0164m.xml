                    education, however, was conducted at home under the eye of her mother by an
                    accomplished governess. In 1758 she removed along with her mother to Paris,
                    where her skill in music and her vivacious wit speedily attracted attention and
                    admiration. Her marriage with the Comte de Genlis, a colonel of grenadiers, who
                    afterwards became marquis of Sillery, took place in her sixteenth year, but was
                    not suffered to interfere with a rapidly developing taste for acquiring and
                    imparting knowledge. Some years later, through the influence of her aunt, Madame
                    de Montesson, who had been clandestinely married to the duke of Orleans, she
                    entered the Palais Royal as lady-in-waiting to the duchess of Chartres (1770);
                    and, after having acted with great energy and zeal as governess to the daughters
                    of the family, she was in 1781 appointed by the duke to the responsible office
                    of “gouverneur” of his sons, a bold step which, though it led to the resignation
                    of all the tutors as well as to much social scandal, can hardly in fairness be
                    held to have seriously prejudiced the intellectual interests at least of those
                    committed to her charge. The better to carry out her theory of education, she
                    wrote several works for the use of her royal pupils, the best known of which are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Théâtre</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;Γ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Éducation</hi> (1779-80), a collection of short comedies for young people, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Les Annales de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Vertu</hi> (1781).
                    When the Revolution of 1789 occurred, Madame de Genlis showed herself not
                    unfavourable to the movement, and is said to have had considerable influence on
                    the conduct of the duke of Orleans; but the fall of the Girondins in 1793
                    compelled her to take refuge in Switzerland along with her pupil Mademoiselle
                    d’Orleans. It was in this year that her husband, the marquis of Sillery, from
                    whom she had been separated since 1782, perished on the scaffold. An “adopted”
                    daughter, Pamela Berkley or Simms, had been married to Lord Edward Fitzgerald in
                    the preceding December (see Sir Bernard Burke’s <hi rend="italic">Pise of Great
                    Families,</hi> 1872). In 1794 Madame de Genlis fixed her residence at Berlin,
                    but having been expelled by the orders of King Frederick William, she afterwards
                    settled in Hamburg, where she supported herself for some years by writing and
                    painting. After the revolution of 18th Brumaire (1799) she was permitted to
                    return to France, and was received with favour by Napoleon, who gave her
                    apartments at the arsenal, and afterwards assigned her a pension of 6000 francs.
                    During this period she wrote largely, and produced what is generally considered
                    to be her best romance, entitled <hi rend="italic">Mademoiselle de
                    Clermont.</hi> At the restoration she succeeded in adjusting herself once more
                    to the new state of things, and continued to write with all her former
                    diligence. Her later years were occupied largely with literary quarrels, notably
                    with that which arose out of the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dîners</hi><hi rend="italic">du Baron &lt;T</hi><hi rend="italic">Holbach,</hi>
                    a volume in which she set forth with a good deal of sarcastic cleverness the
                    intolerance, the fanaticism, and the eccentricities of the “philosophes” of the
                    18th century. Madame de Genlis before her death, which occurred on the 31st of
                    December 1830, had the satisfaction of seeing her former pupil, Louie Philippe,
                    seated on the throne of France.</p>
                <p>The numerous works of Madame de Genlis (which considerably exceed eighty),
                    comprising prose and poetical compositions on a vast variety of subjects and of
                    various degrees of merit, owed much of their success to adventitious causes
                    which have long ceased to operate, and they are now but little read. The
                    swiftness with which they were written, their very multiplicity, and their
                    diffuseness, all forbid us to look in them for thought of perennial value or
                    literary art of any high order. They are useful, however (especially the
                    voluminous <hi rend="italic">Mémoires),</hi> as furnishing material for history;
                    and she herself can hardly pass altogether unnoticed in the crowd which thronged
                    the stage of public life in the confused and busy time of the French Revolution.
                    Most of her writings were translated into English almost as soon as they were
                    published.</p>
