                    (1816-1872), who enjoyed a most extensive popularity as a novelist and a writer
                    of travels both at home and abroad, was born at Hamburg ou 10th May 1816. Having
                    lost his father at the age of nine, he was placed under the guardianship of an
                    uncle at <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n568/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0568-0551"/> Brunswick, who sent him to a house of business at
                    Cassel as clerk. He soon got tired, however, of the monotonous commercial
                    routine, and selected the more active life of a farmer, in which capacity he
                    spent the years from 1835 to 1837 in Saxony. But the uneventful agricultural
                    life was unable to repress in him the innate roving instinct which, according to
                    his own statement, had received a strong impulse in his eighth year by the
                    perusal of <hi rend="italic">Robinson Crusoe.</hi> The word “America” had from
                    that time exercised on him an irresistible charm, and so he went in 1837 from
                    Bremen to New York. He travelled on foot over all parts of the United States,
                    working as he went for his bare subsistence, and then settled for some time in
                    Arkansas, where he led the life of a roving sportsman, Only now and then he
                    visited inhabited places to see civilized society, and to earn some means by
                    whatever work he could obtain. Thus he went in 1842 to Point Coupée in
                    Louisiana, where he undertook the management of a hotel. This time, however, he
                    did not return with the acquired means to the backwoods, but repaired to his
                    German home to see his mother and other relatives, after having led an
                    adventurous life for six years and a half. On his return to Germany he found
                    himself, to his great surprise, known as an author, on a limited scale at least.
                    His mother had shown his diary, which he regularly sent home, and which
                    contained descriptions of his adventures in the New World, to the editor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Posen,</hi> who readily published them in his periodical. The
                    travelling sketches having found great favour with the German public, Gerstäcker
                    issued them, in 1844, in a collected form, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Streif-und Jagdzüge durch die Vereinigten Staaten Nordamerikas.</hi> His next
                    literary labours consisted of translations from the English, during the
                    performance of which it occurred to him that he might himself become an original
                    author, since he was able to delineate original characters, to relate remarkable
                    occurrences, and to describe romantic scenery from his own experience, whilst
                    others were obliged to draw upon their imagination only in producing works of
                    fiction. Accordingly Gerstäcker issued, in 1845, his first novel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Regulatoren</hi><hi rend="italic">in
                    Arkansas,</hi> and henceforth the stream of his productiveness flowed on
                    uninterruptedly. In 1849 he again repaired to America, being this time provided
                    with a grant from the then “German Government,” and acting at the same time as
                    correspondent to the <hi rend="italic">Augsburger</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Allgem.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitung.</hi> After having made very extensive
                    travels both in America, Polynesia, and Australia, he returned in 1852 to
                    Leipsic. In 1860 his innate restlessness drove him to South America, chiefly
                    with a view of inspecting the German colonies there. After having traversed
                    nearly all the principal South American countries he returned to Germany, but
                    for a short time only, for in 1862 he accompanied the Duke Ernest of
                    Coburg-Gotha to Egypt and Abyssinia. This was his last great journey, after the
                    return from which he lived first near Gotha and then at Brunswick, where he died
                    on May 31, 1872.</p>
                <p>Gerstäcker was greatly esteemed and liked as a man, on account of his genial
                    temper and straightforward character, and as an author he enjoyed an almost
                    unprecedented popularity at home and was very favourably known abroad. The charm
                    of his productions consists in the natural freshness of his descriptions, nearly
                    all of which have an exotic background, and in the originality of his
                    characters, the most prominent of which are drawn from real life. He did not
                    possess any high literary power, and probably never touched up what he had once
                    written; his writings lack therefore on the whole that artistic finish which
                    forms one of the principal elements of a good writer. This defect, however,
                    impresses even on his works of fiction the stamp of probability, nay of
                    truthfulness. His writings nowhere betray that intention of producing an effect
                    which so often destroys the illusion of the reader in elaborately worked out
                    productions. He generally writes in a homely, ungarnished manner, just as a
                    traveller would relate his adventures amidst a circle of friends. His writings,
                    therefore, nearly always rivet the attention of the reader from beginning to
                    end. The works of Gerstäcker have, besides, the merit that they formed a
                    wholesome counterpoise against the too idealistic tendency of the literature of
                    Germany, against the lax and realistic school of France, and against the morbid
                    sensationalism which prevailed in England. A number of his works have been
                    translated into several modern languages, but mostly into English; their
                    descriptions of exciting adventures on land and sea affording, with their sturdy
                    humour, congenial reading to the English-speaking community in the Old and New
                    World. His best works, from a literary point of view, are, besides the
                    above-mentioned <hi rend="italic">Regulatoren,</hi> his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fluszpiraten des Mississippi,</hi> his South Sea novel <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tahiti,</hi> his Australian romance <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >beiden Sträflinge,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Matrosenleben</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Blau Wasser.</hi> His collected works have been issued in a cheap
                    and handy edition published at Jena.</p>
