                    >Glycerinum),</hi> a sugar-like substance obtainable from most natural fatty
                    bodies by the action of alkalies and similar reagents, whereby the fats are
                    decomposed, water being taken up, and glycerin being formed together with the

                    the ordinary process of soap-making consists simply in the formation from
                    natural fatty bodies and alkalies of the alkaline salts of the fatty acids
                    thence derivable, soap being a mixture of these alkaline salts in various
                    proportions, according to the particular purposes for which it is required, and
                    its price. In the ordinary process of soap-making the complementary product,
                    glycerin, remains dissolved in the aqueous liquors from which the soap is
                    separated, and is usually thrown away; in many other instances, however, in
                    which a substance capable of undergoing a reaction of saponification is thus
                    treated, the product complementary to the alkaline salt is the more important of
                    the two.</p>
                <p>The fact that soap is obtainable by boiling together oily or fatty substances and
                    alkalies (such as potashes and natron or mineral alkali) was known at an early
                    period of history, being mentioned by Pliny, Galen, Aetius, and Paulus Aegineta.
                    On the other hand, substances referred to in the Old Testament and translated
                    “soap” <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Jeremiah ii. 22, “For though thou wash thee
                    with nitre [properly, natron], aud take thee much soap;” Malachi iii. 2, “For he
                    is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap ”) refer to the alkali itself
                    (viz., <hi rend="italic">l&gt;orith</hi> = vegetable alkali, potash; or <hi
                    rend="italic">neter =</hi> mineral alkali, soda), and not to the substances
                    prepared from oily bodies and these alkaline matters. Similarly Homer makes no
                    mention of soap whilst describing the laundry operations of Nausicaa. The
                    discovery of glycerin, however, is of modern origin, the body having been first
                    described in 1776 by Scheele under the name of oelsüss (principe doux des
                    huiles—sweet principle of oils), and more fully investigated subsequently by
                    Chevreul, Berthelot, and many other chemists, from whose researches it results
                    that glycerin is a trihydric alcohol indicated by the formula C <hi

                <p>These four substances evidently form a progressive series, each number of which
                    differs from the preceding one in the same way, viz., that one more stearyl
                    group replaces hydrogen in the original OH groups.</p>
                <p>The process of saponification may be viewed as the gradual progressive
                    transformation of tristearin, or some analogously constituted substance, into
                    distearin, monostearin, and glycerin, or as the similar transformation of a
                    substance analogous to distearin or to monostearin into glycerin. If the
                    reaction is brought about in presence of an alkali, the acid set free becomes
                    transformed into the corresponding alkaline salt; but if the decomposition is
                    effected without the presence of an alkali <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> by
                    means of water alone, or by an acid fluid), the acid set free and the glycerin
                    are obtained together in a form which usually admits of their ready separation.
                    It is noticeable that with few exceptions the fatty and oily matters occurring
                    in nature are substances analogous to tristearin, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>

                    production of these acids on saponification and distillation with dilute
                    sulphuric acid is utilized as a test of a purity of butter as sold. <hi

                    three radicals which replace hydrogen in glycerin are not all identical; thus
                    kephalin, myelin, and lecithin are glycerides in which two hydrogens are
                    replaced by fatty acid radicals, and the third by a complex phosphoric acid

                    synthetically by reversing the reactions of saponification, or being produced by
                    the partial saponification of substances analogous to tristearin.</p>
                <p>Glycerin is also a product of certain kinds of fermentation, especially of the
                    alcoholic fermentation of sugar; thus it is a constituent of many wines and
                    other fermented liquors, being formed together with small quantities of various
                    other substances by reactions subsidiary only to the main change taking place,
                    and hence varying in their nature and extent with circumstances. According to

                    in the fermentation of grape juice and similar saccharine liquids into alcohol
                    and other products becomes converted into glycerin. In certain natural fatty

                    oil, it exists in the free state, so that it can be separated by washing with
                    boiling water, which dissolves the glycerin but not the fatty glycerides; but
                    how far its occurrence in this form is due to the breaking up of the glyceride
                    by a spontaneous saponification is open to some question.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Properties.—</hi> In a state of purity glycerin is a viscid,
                    colourless liquid of sp. gr. 1 ’ 264, possessing a somewhat mawkish sweet taste;
                    when exposed to a high degree of cold for a long time it sometimes solidifies to
                    a crystalline mass, which then melts at about 7° C. The crystals when once
                    melted often do not resolidify again readily, even when in contact with the
                    solid substance, although sometimes contact with a crystal of the solid at a
                    temperature of about 0° suffices to produce solidification of the whole. This
                    solidification of glycerin is, however, a very exceptional phenomenon, only
                    occurring with extremely pure sub stance under certain conditions not thoroughly
                    under stood, and then only after long continued exposure to a low temperature,
                    as during a cold winter. When containing a minute quantity of water glycerin
                    never solidifies, and to this circumstance several of its useful applications
                    are due. A weak aqueous solution, when chilled sufficiently, allows crystals of
                    ice to form, the glycerin accumulating in the unfrozen portion as alcohol does
                    when a mixture of spirit and water is partially frozen. When heated alone it
                    partially volatilizes, but the greater part decomposes; by reducing the pressure
                    to about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> th of an atmosphere, it can, however, be readily
                    distilled unchanged, boiling under a pressure of 50 millimetres of mercury at
                    about 20° C. In an atmosphere of steam, also, it distils without decomposition
                    under ordinary barometric pressure. In water and alcohol it dissolves readily in
                    all proportions; in ether it is insoluble. Under certain conditions, such as
                    prolonged contact with poor cheese and chalk at about 35° to 40° C., it can be
                    made to ferment partially, becoming changed into alcohol; but under any
                    circumstances, only a small fraction, at most a tenth, becomes thus transformed,
                    the rest remaining unaltered. It possesses remarkable solvent powers on many
                    substances, whence it is employed for numerous purposes in pharmacy and the
                    arts. Its viscid character, and its non-liability to dry and harden by exposure
                    to air, also fit it for various other uses, such as lubrication, &amp;c., whilst
                    its peculiar physical characters, enabling it to blend with either aqueous or
                    oily matters under certain circumstances, render it a useful ingredient in a
                    large number of products of varied kinds. Applied to the living skin (and
                    similarly to untanned leather) it produces a remarkable softening effect, whence
                    it is largely employed as a cosmetic, either by itself or in admixture with
                    other substances. Taken internally it is alleged to be valuable as a substitute
                    for cod-liver oil for phthisical patients, not possessing the disagreeable fishy
                    flavour of that valuable food, and having a fattening tendency. When it is given
                    in moderately small repeated doses to the lower animals, it does not appear to
                    possess any marked injurious action peculiar to itself; when, however, large
                    doses of glycerin are subcutaneously injected into dogs, amounting to from 8 to
                    10 grammes per kilogramme of animal operated on (0 ’ 8 to 1Ό per cent, of the
                    weight of the dog, corresponding to from 1 lb to 1⅜ lb of glycerin for the
                    weight of an average man), death ensues within twenty-four hours, accompanied by
                    symptoms analogous to those of acute alcoholism (Dujardin, Beaumetz, and
                    Audigé). Like sugar it possesses antiseptic qualities, so that meat, albumin,
                    &lt;fcc., immersed in it do not for long periods of time undergo putrefactive
                    changes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture.—</hi> The simplest modes of preparing glycerin in
                    a state of purity are based on the saponification of fats, either by alkalies or
                    analogous basic substances, or by superheated steam, and on the circumstance
                    that, although glycerin cannot be distilled by itself under the ordinary
                    pressure without decomposition, it can be readily volatilized in a current of
                    superheated steam; in this way the glycerin formed is separated from the
                    non-volatile substances present. It was by means of saponification of olive oil
                    or lard with litharge (lead oxide), whereby a lead soap insoluble in water, or
                    nearly so, is formed, together with glycerin, that the existence of glycerin was
                    first demonstrated by Scheele, who obtained it as a bye-product in the formation
                    of the “lead-plaster” of pharmacy made from lard and lead oxide. For a long time
                    this was the only known method of preparing glycerin, the aqueous solution
                    obtained being treated with sulphuretted hydrogen to remove any soluble lead
                    compounds, filtered, and evaporated until almost all the water was. driven otf,
                    leaving the glycerin behind as a syrupy fluid. By evaporating down the spent
                    leys of the soapmaker (after the soap is separated therefrom by “salting out,”
                    and any excess of alkali neutralized with sulphuric acid), and treating the
                    residue with alcohol, glycerin can also be obtained, the alcoholic solution of
                    it thus formed being simply evaporated to drive off the alcohol; but this
                    process is far too costly for ordinary purposes. An improvement on this method
                    was patented in 1858 by H. Reynolds, the concentrated leys being passed into a
                    vessel where they are met by a stream of superheated steam at about 200° C.; the
                    glycerin then passes over with the aqueous vapour, whilst the inorganic salts
                    present are left behind. In the manufacture of stearic acid for candle-making
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Candle)</hi> one of the older processes was the
                    saponification of tallow with lime, forming an insoluble lime soap and (an
                    aqueous solution of impure glycerin, fιom which the pure substance can be
                    readily obtained by distillation with superheated steam. Less pure products were
                    formerly obtained by treating the crude solution with sulphuric acid to separate
                    lime, boiling to remove small quantities of volatile acids, evaporation, and
                    filtration through animal charcoal to decolorize; or by evaporating, dissolving
                    out by alcohol, and purifying by treating with lead oxide, filtering to separate
                    an insoluble lead compound formed, removing lead from this filtrate by
                    sulphuretted hydrogen, filtering again, and evaporating to a syrup. In practice
                    all these older methods have, however, been superseded by the process patented
                    in 1854 by Wilson &amp; Payne. This consists in heating the fatty matter to be
                    saponified in an appropriate still to a temperature of 290° to 315° C. (550° to
                    600° Fahr.), and passing in heated steam in such a way that it rises up through
                    the fatty matter in numerous streams; saponification is thus rapidly effected,
                    and the liberated glycerin and fatty acids are volatilized and carried along
                    with the steam to the condensing arrangement. If the temperature do not exceed
                    310° C. there is no fear of the glycerin being decomposed, whilst under suitable
                    conditions even higher temperatures than this can be employed without causing
                    its decomposition; but there is always a great liability to destruction of
                    glycerin when the temperature of 310° is exceeded. This arises from the tendency
                    of the glycerin to char on heating, and to split up into water and <hi

                <p>When a series of chambers is used as the refrigerator, the compartments nearest
                    the still are found to condense little but fatty acids, the water and glycerin
                    chiefly accumulating in the more distant chambers, the last of which is usually
                    open to the air at the end; so that there is no excess of pressure in the still
                    and condensers; the fatty acids readily separate from the aqueous solutions of
                    glycerin, which only requires concentration by evaporation to be fit for the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> market. Since the date of Wilson’s patent various
                    special forms of apparatus for effecting the transformation have been patented
                    by Wright &amp; Fouche, Gilbee, and others.</p>
                <p>This method of saponification is, strictly, only an improvement on former
                    processes invented for the purpose of decomposing the glycerides and obtaining
                    the fatty acids without the ’ use of alkalies, lime, &amp;c.; in these older
                    methods the extraction of glycerin was not an important feature, and they wer%
                    frequently worked in such a way as to decompose the whole or greater part of the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0722-0699"/> its liberation. Thus, as far back as 1825,
                    Chevreul and Gay-Lussac sketched ont the idea of the process of saponification
                    by superheated steam, and the method was actually carried out with certain
                    modifications by various chemists and manufacturers. For example, in 1842, E.
                    Price &amp; Co. patented, in the name of Jones &amp; Wilson, a process of the
                    kind, which was largely worked for some years; in this, the fatty matter freed
                    from extraneous impurities is mixed with 6 to 8 per cent, of strong sulphuric
                    acid, and then heated in copper boilers to about 180° C., by superheated steam
                    blown through the mass for about two hours; after which hotter steam at abolit
                    300’ to 350° is blown through, when fatty acids distil, but little or no
                    glycerin passes oveι unaltered, almost the whole being charred or decomposed,
                    forming acrolein, &amp;c. Here the saponification and destruction of glycerin
                    are largely effected by the sulphuric acid, as well as by the steam itself.
                    Price’s process was suggested to the inventors by Tilghman’s method, brought out
                    early in 1854, which consisted in making an emulsion of melted fatty matter and
                    water (or solution of alkali) by agitation, and then pumping it through a long
                    coil of iron tubing kept at a temperature near that of melted lead under a
                    pressure of about 2000 lb to the square inch. In this way complete
                    saponification is effected, fatty acids and an aqueous solution of glycerin
                    being obtained when water is used, and soap with more or less water and glycerin
                    when alkaline liquor is employed. It is noticeable that in this process it is
                    not necessary that the alkali should be caustic, as it must be for the ordinary
                    process of soap-boiling; sodium and potassium carbonates answer just as well as
                    their respective hydrates (caustic soda, caustic potash).</p>

                    the production of “nitro-glycerin” and other chemical products, glycerin is
                    largely employed for a number of purposes in the arts, its application thereto
                    being due to its peculiar physical properties. Thus its non-liability to freeze
                    (when not absolutely anhydrous, which it practically never is when freely
                    exposed to the air) and its non volatility at ordinary temperatures, combined
                    with its power of always keeping fluid and not drying up and hardening, render
                    it valuable as a lubricating agent for clockwork, watches, &amp;c., as a
                    substitute for water in wet gas-meters, and as an ingredient in cataplasms,
                    plasters, modelling clay, pasty colouring matters, dyeing materials, moist
                    colours for artists, and numerous other analogous substances which are
                    re&lt;μιired to be kept in a permanently soft condition. From its softening
                    property when applied to the skin, it constitutes a chief ingredient in many
                    toilet preparations, creams, and the like. Many of these indeed, sold .under
                    fancy names, are nothing but glycerin diluted with water or weak alcohol, or
                    mixed with some oleaginous emulsion or paste, and variously scented. Its solvent
                    power for numerous substances lenders it valuable in pharmacy as an ingredient
                    in numerous preparations. In some of these the glycerin acts not merely as a
                    solvent but also as a preservative against decomposition, owing to its
                    antiseptic qualities, which also led to its being employed to preserve untanned
                    leather (especially during transit when exported, the hides being, moreover,
                    kept soft and supple); to make solutions of gelatin, albumen, gum, paste,
                    cements, &amp;c., which will keep without decomposition; to preserve meat and
                    other edibles; to mount anatomical preparations; to preserve vaccine lymph
                    unchanged; and for many similar purposes. Its solvent power is also utilized in
                    the production of various colouring fluids, where the colouring matter would not
                    dissolve in water alone; thus aniline violet, the tinctorial constituents of
                    madder, and various allied colouring matters dissolve in glycerin, forming
                    liquids which remain coloured even when diluted with water, the colouring
                    matters being either retained in suspension or dissolved by the glycerin present
                    in the diluted fluid. It has been proposed to use glycerin as a medium for the
                    extraction of the odoriferous principle of flowers, &amp;c., and as a substitute
                    for sugar in the manufacture of some sorts of tobacco, the aιoma of which is
                    liable to be deteriorated should fermentation of the saccharine matter set in.
                    Certain kinds of copying inks are greatly improved by the substitution of
                    glycerin, in part or entirely, for the sugar or honey usually added. In fine,
                    the number of useful adaptations of glycerin as an ingredient in older to confer
                    certain special properties is almost unlimited, and its use in these directions
                    is increasing yearly.</p>

                    saponification of oils, &amp;c., with oxide of lead or lime, are apt to retain
                    more or less of the metallic compounds, whilst glycerin extracted from soap-leys
                    may also contain mineral matters. Such impure substances are readily purified by
                    distillation with steam or under greatly diminished pressure. Glycerin prepared
                    by saponifying clarified tallow, &amp;c·, by superheated steam, rarely contains
                    fatty acids; if not deprived of practically all the water with which it is mixed
                    in the distillate first obtained, it is less viscid and has a lower density, so
                    that the specific gravity forms a good test as to whether it contains much water
                    or not. Occasionally glycerin is met with intentionally adulterated with
                    sugaι-syrup, gum, mineral matters, &amp;c. <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> but such
                    falsifications are comparatively rare. They may be detected by the substance
                    being not wholly soluble in alcohol, by its leaving a residue on ignition in
                    air, by its precipitating a solution of basic lead acetate (after being
                    dissolved in water), or by other special tests, according to the nature of the
                    impurity sought for. Thus, whilst pure glycerin does not reduce alkaline copper
                    solutions so as to precipitate cuprous oxide when boiled therewith, the
                    precipitation is readily produced by certain kinds of sugar, either without any
                    previous treatment (e.y., glucose), or after boiling for a short time with water
                    acidulated with a mineral acid such as sulphuric acid <hi rend="italic"
