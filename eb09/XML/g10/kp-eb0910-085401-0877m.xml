                    and beginning of the 13th century. Of his life and position we have no certain
                    information, for he has told us next to nothing about himself, and contemporary
                    records are dubious and confusing. It would seem, however, that he was a man of
                    good birth and position, who filled an important municipal office in his native
                    town of Strasburg. His chief work was written about 1210, and we may confidently
                    place his death between 1210 and 1220. We know from his writings that lie was a
                    man of high culture, but it is almost certain that he was not a priest. Of this
                    his occasional sneers at the clergy are perhaps abetter proof than the dubious
                    morality of much of his work. Gottfried wrote one great poem, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tristan</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Isolt.</hi> The story
                    is of Celtic origin; it came first from Britain and Ireland, thence was carried
                    to France, and thence to Germany. Few stories have been so often treated or have
                    had so wide an influence upon literature. A very few words will suffice to give
                    Gottfried’s version of it. King Mark of Cornwall has a nephew named Tristan,
                    whom he sends to woo vicariously, and bring home as queen of Cornwall, the
                    beautiful Isolt, princess of Ireland. The young man goes on his mission, is
                    successful, and sets out with Isolt on the homeward journey. Before they reach
                    Cornwall, however, they unfortunately drink a love potion which Isolt’s mother
                    had intended to be given to her daughter by the king of Cornwall. The
                    consequence of the mistake is that the young people fall madly and hopelessly in
                    love with one another. The wild force of their passion soon causes them to
                    disregard morality and prudence alike, and the bulk of the poem is devoted to an
                    account of the numerous complications which in time arose. Of course the king
                    soon becomes suspicious, and at last his suspicions become certainties. Tristan
                    withdraws to Normandy, and enters into an alliance with a princess of the land,
                    whose very name—Isolt, the white-handed—has a strange charm for him. But he
                    finds that he really cares nothing for this new Isolt; the memory of hi3 old
                    love rises powerfully in his soul; and he gives utterances to his doubts and
                    perplexities in a soliloquy, with which the poem abruptly concludes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> is thus an unfinished work; still it is a
                    tolerably long one, as it consists of 19,552 short rhymed lines. The style is
                    highly finished. There is an artistic choice of fit words, a frequent use of
                    antithesis and word-play, and a skilful management of the versification. But
                    these are, of course, only side matters. The permanent interest of the poem
                    consists in its representation of human passion, and in the knowledge it shows
                    of the human heart. The plain, rude story, when told by Gottfried, takes a depth
                    and pathos that are hardly its own. All is described, too, with such clear,
                    bright touches, and such vivid force, that the poem seems somehow a tale of our
                    own time. Its morality indeed is not high; but this objection did not probably
                    occur to those who first read it. If we judge it by a purely art standard, we
                    must pronounce it worthy of an important place in the literature of Europe. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tristan</hi> was not allowed to remain a fragment. Ulrich von
                    Türheim (about 1236) and Heinrich von Freiberg (about 1270) both wrote
                    continuations and conclusions of the work, which certainly fell far short of the
                    original.</p>
                <p>Of Gottfried’s other writings, only some lyrics in the ordinary style of the
                    minnesingers remain to us. Two longer poems, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lobgesang auf</hi><hi rend="italic">die Jungfrau Maria</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gedicht von der</hi><hi rend="italic">Armuth,</hi> were long
                    attributed to him, but recent criticism has conclusively proved that they are
                    the work of others. Gottfried’s influence on German literature was very great,
                    and a proof of this is the number of poets who treated the same subject after
                    the plan he had laid down. All these, from Hans Sachs (1494-1570) to Immermann
                    (1796-1840), may fairly be claimed as his followers.</p>
                <p>The chief editions of Gottfried’s <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> are those of Fr.
                    Heinrich V. d. Hagen (a complete edition, with the continuations, Brest, 1823),
                    Groote (Berlin, 1821), Massmann (Leip., 1843), and Bechstein (containing a very
                    able and complete introduction, 2d ed., 2 vols., Leip., 1873). See also the
                    translations into modern German, with continuations, &amp;c., by Herrn. Kurz
                    (Stuttg., 1844, 3d ed., 1877), and Karl Simrock (2d ed., Leip., 1875). For what
                    is known of the life of Gottfried see Kurz’s “Zum Leben Gottfried von
