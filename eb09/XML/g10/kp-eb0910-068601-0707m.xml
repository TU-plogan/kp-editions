                    γλώσσαι was at a comparatively early date a well-recognized form of literary
                    activity. Even in the 5th century, among the many writings of Democritus of
                    Abdera was included a treatise entitled Περί <hi rend="italic">Όμηρου</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">η opθoeπciης κdi</hi> γλωσσεωr. It was not, however, until the
                    Alexandrian period that the <hi rend="italic">γλωσσογράφοι</hi> became very
                    numerous. Of many of these it is probable that even the names have perished; but
                    in the writings of Athenaeus alone (c. 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    allusions are to be found to no fewer than thirty-five. Among the earliest may
                    be mentioned Philetas of Cos (d. <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 290 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>),the elegiac poet, to whom Aristarchus dedicated the
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">πpoςΦιλητaw,</hi> he was the compiler of a
                    lexicographical work, arranged probably according to subjects, and entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">"Ατακτα</hi> or Γλώσσαι (sometimes <hi rend="italic">άτακτοι
                    γλώσσαι).</hi> Next came his disciple Zenodotus of Ephesus (c. 280 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), one of the earliest of the Homeric critics and the
                    compiler of <hi rend="italic">ΡλωσσαιΌμηρικαί;</hi> Zenodotus in turn was
                    succeeded by his greater pupil Aristophanes of Byzantium (c. 200 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> whose great compilation 7r∈pι <hi rend="italic"
                    >λeξeωv</hi> (still partially preserved in that of Pollux), is known to have
                    included Αττικαι <hi rend="italic">λiξeις, Aaκωvικdi γλωσσaι,</hi> and the like.
                    From the school of Aristophanes issued more than one glossographer of
                    name,—Diodorus, Artemidorus (γλώσσαι, and a collection of λ∈⅛eιs <hi
                    rend="italic">δψaρτυτικai),</hi> Nicander of Colophon (γλώσσαι, of which some
                    twenty-six fragments still survive), and Aristarchus, the famous critic, whose
                    numerous labours included an arrangment of the Homeric vocabulary <hi
                    rend="italic">(λεξuς)</hi> in the order of the books. Contemporary with the last
                    named was Crates of Mallos, who, besides making some new contributions to Greek
                    lexicography and dialectology, was the first to create at Rome a taste for
                    similar investigations in connexion with the Latin idioms. From his school
                    proceeded Zenodotus of Kfallos, the compiler of ’ E⅛ικαι λε'^εις or γλώσσαι, a
                    work said to have been designed chiefly to support the views of the school of
                    Pergamus as to the allegorical interpretation of Homer. <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> Of later date were Didymus (Chalkenteros, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 50
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), who made collections of λε'ςεις τpαγωδoυ∕zεVαι,

                    century of the Christian era we find Apion, a grammarian and rhetorician at Rome
                    during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius, following up the labours of
                    Aristarchus and other predecessors with γλώσσαι <hi rend="italic">Όμηρικαί,</hi>
                    and a treatise περί <hi rend="italic">της 'Ρωμαϊκής διαλέκτου</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Heliodorus or Herodorus was another almost contemporary
                    glossographer; Erotian also, during the reign of Nero, prepared a special
                    glossary for the writings of Hippocrates, still preserved. To this period also
                    Pamphilus, the author of the λειμών, from which Diogenian and Julius Vestinus
                    afterwards drew so largely, most probably belonged. In the following century one
                    of the most prominent workers in this department of literature was Aelius
                    Herodianus, whose treatise 7τ∈pι <hi rend="italic">μονήρους λέξεως</hi> has been
                    edited in modern times, and whose <hi rend="italic">ιπιμepισμοl</hi> we still
                    possess in an abridgment; other names are those of Pollux, of Diogenian <hi
                    rend="italic">(λέξις</hi><hi rend="italic">πavτoδaπη),</hi> of Julius Vestinus
                    (επιτομή <hi rend="italic">των</hi><hi rend="italic">Tiaμφiλου</hi> γλωσσών),
                    and especially that of Phrynichus, who flourished towards the close of the 2d
                    century. His <hi rend="italic">Eclogce</hi><hi rend="italic">nominum et verborum
                    Atticorum</hi> has frequently been edited. To the 4th century belongs Ammonius
                    of Alexandria (c. 389), who wrote περί <hi rend="italic">όμοιων και διαφόρων
                    λέξεων,</hi> a dictionary of words used in senses different from those in which
                    they had been employed by older and approved writers. Of somewhat later date is
                    the well-known Hesychius, whose often-edited <hi rend="italic">Αεξικόν</hi>
                    rightly superseded all previous works of the kind; Cyril, the celebrated
                    patriarch of Alexandria, also contributed somewhat to the advancement of
                    glossography by his <hi rend="italic">συναγωγή των προς διάφορον σημασίαν
                    διαφόρως τονουμένων λέξεων;</hi> the names of Orus and Orion, of Philoxenus, and
                    of the two Philemons also belong to this period. The works of Photius, Suidas,
                    and Zonaras, as also the <hi rend="italic">Etymologicum</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    been referred to <hi rend="smallcaps">(Dictionary,</hi> vol. vii. p. 183). In
                    Latin lexicology the most prominent name is that of Festus, whose only extant
                    work, however, is but an epitome of the treatise of Verrius Flaccus <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Verborum Significatu.</hi> This
                    last-named author had himself been preceded by Varro <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Lingua Latina),</hi> who in turn makes allusion to several before him “qui
                    glossas scripserunt.” The introduction of grammatical and linguistic studies
                    into Rome is usually attributed to Crates of Mallos <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi>

                <p>In Italy also, during the period of the Byzantine ascendency, various glossae
                    (glosae) and scholia on the Justinian code were produced; <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 3</hi> particularly the Turin gloss (reprinted by Savigny), to which, apart
                    from later additions, a date prior to 1000 is usually assigned. After the total
                    extinction of the Byzantine authority in the West the study of law became one of
                    the free arts, and numerous schools for its cultivation were instituted. Among
                    the earliest of these was that of Bologna, where Pepo (1075) and Irnerius
                    (1100-1118) began to give their expositions. They had a numerous following, who,
                    besides delivering exegetical lectures (“ordinariae” on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    decay of learning and originality during the dark ages grew the necessity for
                    making and the custom of transcribing on manuscript copies of the Vulgate
                    various notes, explanatory or otherwise, of the text. Ultimately collections of
                    these glosses or sets of glosses came to be made. They are distinguished as
                    either marginal or interlinear. The most famous collection of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glossoe marginales</hi> was that made by Walafridus Strabus in the 9th century;
                    it consists of notes grammatical, historical, and theological, culled from the
                    writings of Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Isidore, Bede, Alcuin, and
                    Hrabanus Maurus, with additions by himself. The interlinear glosses (which as a
                    rule were not so full as the marginal) were sometimes theological but more
                    generally purely philological. A somewhat important collection of interlineal
                    glosses belonging to the former class was made by Anselm of Laon (c. 1100). The
                    philological glosses have considerable value to the linguistic student,
                    especially those which originated in Germany during the Carolingian period. The
                    MS. vocabularies in the libraries of St Gall, Munich, Vienna, &lt;fcc., have
                    been frequently examined, of late years with results which have been fully
