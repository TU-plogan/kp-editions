                <p><label type="entry">GENNADIUS</label>. Georgius Scholari or Scholarius, better
                    known as Gennadius, a learned Greek and for some time patriarch of
                    Constantinople, obtains a place in history through the important part played by
                    him in the contest between Platonism and Aristoteliaoism which marks the
                    transition from mediaeval to modern thought. Extremely little is known of his
                    life, and so contradictory are some of the accounts bearing on detached facts in
                    it that it has often been supposed there were two writers of the same name
                    living at the same period. The researches of Renaudot seem, however, to render
                    it approximately certain that all the historical notices we possess relate to
                    one Scholarius, and that the apparent inconsistency in the accounts is due
                    largely to a real change in that writer’s views. Scholarius first appears in
                    history as assisting at the great council held in 1438 at Ferrara and Florence
                    with the object of bringing about a union between the Greek and Latin Churches
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugenius</hi> IV., <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Bessaeion).</hi> At the same council was present the celebrated Platonist,
                    George Gemistus Pletho, the most powerful opponent of the then dominant
                    Aristotelianism, and consequently the special object of reprobation to
                    Gennadius. In church matters, as in philosophy, the two were opposed,—Pletho
                    maintaining strongly the principles of the Greek Church, and being unwilling to
                    accept union through compromise, Gennadius, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n165/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0165-0154"/> more politic and cautiou3, pressing the
                    necessity for union, and instrumental in drawing up a form which from its
                    vagueness and ambiguity might be accepted by both parties. It would seem that at
                    Florence Pletho published the work on the difference between Aristotle and Plato
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gemistus)</hi> which afterwards called forth a reply
                    from Gennadius. Of this reply only the fragments quoted by Pletho in his
                    counter-argument <hi rend="italic">{Contra Gennαdium)</hi> have been preserved.
                    They show that Gennadius, though Aristotelian throughout, had an accurate
                    knowledge of Aristotle, and wa3 more moderate than some of his contemporaries,
                        <hi rend="italic">e.y.,</hi> George of Trebizond. The next appearance of
                    Gennadius is in 1453. After the capture of Constantinople by the Turks, Mahomet,
                    finding that the patriarchal chair had been vacant for some time, resolved to
                    elect some one to the office. The choice fell on Scholarius, who is described as
                    a layman. While holding the episcopal office Gennadius drew up, apparently for
                    the use of Mahomet, a symbol or confession of faith, which is very valuable as
                    the earliest expression of the principles of the Greek Church. He also at this
                    time had the pleasure of condemning to the flames the great work of his old
                    opponent Pletho, the treatise on <hi rend="italic">Laιvs</hi> (Νό/ζοι), of which
                    considerable fragments have come down to us. The character of this work was
                    accurately apprehended by Gennadius (see his <hi rend="italic">Letter to the
                        Exarch Joseph,</hi> in Gass, as below), and his opposition to it is
                    intelligible. After a short period of office at Constantinople Gennadius is said
                    to have resigned the episcopal dignity and to have retired into a convent. The
                    date of his death is unknown.</p>
                <p>The fullest account of his writings is given in Gass <hi rend="italic">(Hennαdvus
                        and Pletho,</hi> 1844), the second part of which contains Pletho’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Contra Gennadiurn.</hi> See also F. Schultze, <hi
