                    taken part in the Conquest, had settled. On the completion of a liberal
                    education, received partly in England and partly in France, Gilbert was ordained
                    a priest in 1123, having been presented by his father to the united livings of
                    Sempringham and Tirington. About 1135 he established in the immediate vicinity
                    of his parish church a religious house for the reception of some destitute
                    girls; the rule he prescribed was substantially that of St Benedict, but the
                    restrictions laid upon the communication of the inmates with the outer world
                    were unusually severe. Subsequently the labourers who tilled the lands with
                    which this establishment had been endowed were also formed into a religious
                    community, under a rule resembling that of the Austin Friars, their house being
                    placed close beside that of the nuns. Similar institutions elsewhere were
                    encouraged by various English proprietors, and placed under the superintendence
                    of Gilbert, who at last made application to Pope Eugenius III. to have them all
                    merged in the Cistercian order (1148). This request, however, was refused, and
                    Gilbert continued to act as superior of the monasteries he had founded for many
                    years; although at the time of his death, on the 3d of February 1189, that
                    dignity was held by Roger, one of his disciples. In 1189 the Gilbertines are
                    said to have possessed thirteen monasteries, with almshouses, hospitals, and
                    orphanages attached; and the community numbered in all upwards of 700 male and
                    1100 female members. At the time of their suppression the total number of
                    Gilbertine houses in England and Wales had increased to about twenty-five.
                    Gilbert, who had sided and suffered with the church in the quarrels between
                    Henry II. and Thomas à Becket, was canonized by Innocent III. in 1202; and his
                    name is commemorated in the martyrologies on the 4th of February. The <hi
