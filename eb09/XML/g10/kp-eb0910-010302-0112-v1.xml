                <p><label type="entry">GASCOIGNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir William</hi></label>, was
                    chief-justice of England in the reign of Henry IV. Both history and tradition
                    testify to the fact that he was one of the great lawyers who in times of doubt
                    and danger have asserted the principle that the head of the state is subject to
                    law, and that the traditional practice of public officers, or the expressed
                    voice of the nation in parliament, and not the will of the monarch or any part
                    of <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> the legislature, must guide the tribunals of the
                    country. The judge was a descendant of an ancient Yorkshire family. The date of
                    his birth is uncertain, but it appears from the Year Books that he practised as
                    an advocate in the reigns of Edward IIL and Richard II. On the banishment of
                    Henry of Lancaster, Gascoigne was appointed one of his attorneys, and soon after
                    Henry’s accession to the throne was made chief-justice of the Court of King’s
                    Bench. After the suppression of the rising in the north in 1405, Henry eagerly
                    pressed thejudge to pronounce sentence upon Scrope, the archbishop of York, and
                    the earl marshal Thomas Mowbray, who had been implicated in the revolt. The
                    judge absolutely refused to do so, asserting the right of the prisoners to be
                    tried by their peers. Although both were afterwards executed, the chief-justice
                    had no part in the transaction. The often told tale of his committing the Prince
                    of Wales to prison has of course been doubted by modem critics, but it is both
                    picturesque and characteristic. Thejudge had directed the punishment of one of
                    the prince’s riotous companions, and the prince who was present and enraged at
                    the sentence struck or grossly insulted the judge. Gascoigne immediately
                    committed him to prison, using firm and forcible language, which brought him to
                    a more reasonable mood, and secured his voluntary obedience to the sentence. The
                    king is said to have approved of the act, but there appears to be good ground
                    for the supposition that Gascoigne was removed from his post or resigned soon
                    after the accession of Henry V. He died in 1419, and was buried in the parish
                    church of Harewood in Yorkshire. Some biographies of the judge have stated that
                    he died in 1412, but this is clearly disproved by Foss in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lives of the Judges;</hi> and although it is clear that Gascoigne did not
                    hold office long under Henry V., it is not absolutely impossible that the scene
                    in the fifth act of the second part of Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Henry</hi><hi rend="italic">IV.</hi> has some historical basis, and that
                    the judge’s resignation was voluntary.</p>
