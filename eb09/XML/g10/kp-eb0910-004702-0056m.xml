                    public libraries while serving as a clerk in a mercantile office. His first
                    compositions appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Greenock Advertiser</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine.</hi> In 1804 he went to settle in London,
                    where he continued to work at a poem on the <hi rend="italic">Battle of
                    Largs,</hi> which was published anonymously. After unsuccessful attempts to
                    succeed in business, Galt left for the Continent, and met Byron and Sir John
                    Hobhouse at Gibraltar, with whom he had a tour in the Mediterranean. He remained
                    abroad for three years, and then returned to London. His early works are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Administration of Wolsey, Voyages and Travels, Letters
                    from the Levant,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Life of Benjamin West, Historical
                    Pictures,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Wandering Jew,</hi> and a volume of dramas;
                    but he first showed his real power in <hi rend="italic">The Ayrshire
                    Legatees,</hi> which appeared in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine</hi> in
                    1820. This was followed in 1821 by his masterpiece— <hi rend="italic">The Annals
                    of the Parish</hi>; and, at short intervals, <hi rend="italic">Sir Andrew Wylie,
                    The Entail, The Steam-Boat,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Provost</hi> were
                    published. These arc all in his happiest manner, and are unsurpassed as studies
                    of Scottish character. His next works were <hi rend="italic">Ringan
                    Gilhaize,</hi> a story of the Covenanters; <hi rend="italic">The Spaewife,</hi>
                    which relates to the times of James I. of Scotland; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rothelan,</hi> a novel founded on the reign of Edward III.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Omen,</hi> which was favourably criticized by Sir Walter Scott; and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Last of the Lairds,</hi> another picture of Scottish life. In
                    1826 he visited America for the second time, in connexion with the establishment
                    of the Canada Company—an undertaking which involved him in great difficulties,
                    and ultimately proved disastrous to his worldly prospects. It is pleasant to
                    remember that, although Gait’s connexion with Canada was unfortuate for himself,
                    his youngest son, Sir Alexander Galt, has had a distinguished career there, and
                    was, for some time, finance minister of the colony. In 1827 Galt founded Guelph
                    in Upper Canada, passing on his way the township of Galt on the Grand River,
                    named after him by the Hon. William Dixon. In 1829 he returned to England
                    commercially a ruined man, and devoted himself with great ardour to literary
                    pursuits, of which the first fruit was <hi rend="italic">Lawrie Todd—</hi> one
                    of his best novels. Then came <hi rend="italic">Southennaη,</hi> a tale of
                    Scottish life in the times of Queen Mary. In 1830 he was appointed editor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> newspaper—a post he soon relinquished. His
                    untiring industry was seen in the publication, in rapid succession, of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Byron, Lives of the Players, Bogle Corbet, Stanley Buxton,
                    The Member, The Radical,</hi><hi rend="italic">Eben</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Erskine, The Stolen Child,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> and a
                    collection of tales entitled <hi rend="italic">Stories of the Study.</hi> In
                    1834 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Literary Life and Miscellanies,</hi>
                    dedicated by permission to William IV., who sent the author a present of £200.
                    As soon as this work was published Galt retired to Greenock, where he lingered
                    on in bad health till his death on the 11th of April 1839.</p>
                <p>Galt, like almost all voluminous writers, was exceedingly unequal. His
                    masterpieces are <hi rend="italic">The Ayrshire Legatees, The Annals of the
                    Parish, Sir Andrew Wylie, The Entail, The Provost,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lawrie Todd. The Ayrshire Legatees</hi> gives, in the form of a number of
                    exceedingly diverting letters, the adventures of the Rev. Dr Pringle and his
                    family in London. The letters are made the excuse for endless teaparties and
                    meetings of kirk session in the rural parish of Garnock. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annals of the Parish</hi> are told by the Rev. Micah Balwhidder, Gait’s finest
                    character. This work is a splendid picture of the old-fashioned Scottish pastor
                    and the life of a country parish; and, in rich humour, genuine pathos, and truth
                    to nature, it is unsurpassed even by Scott. Like his other Scotch novels, it is
                    a fine specimen of the homely graces of the Scottish dialect, and preserves much
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"

                    use even in country districts. In this novel Mr Galt used, for the first time,
                    the term “Utilitarian,” which has since become so intimately associated with the
                    doctrines of John Stuart Mill and his followers (see <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    the Parish,</hi> chap, xxxv., and a note by Air Mill in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Utilitarianism,</hi> chap. it). In Aeir <hi rend="italic">Andrew</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wylie</hi> the hero entered London as a poor lad, but achieved
                    remarkable success by his shrewd business qualities. The character is somewhat
                    exaggerated, but excessively amusing. <hi rend="italic">The Entail</hi> was read
                    thrice by Byron and Scott, and is the best of Gait’s longer novels. Leddy Grippy
                    is a wonderful creation, and was considered by Byron equal to any female
                    character in literature since Shakespeare’s time. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Provost,</hi> in which Provost Pawkie tells his own story, portrays inimitably
                    the jobbery, bickerings, and selfseeking of municipal dignitaries in a quaint
                    Scottish burgh. In <hi rend="italic">Lawrie Todd</hi> Galt, by giving us the
                    Scot in America, has accomplished a feat which Sir Walter never attempted. This
                    novel exhibits more variety of style and a greater love of nature than his other
                    books. The life of a settler is depicted with unerring pencil, and with an
                    enthusiasm and imaginative power much more poetical than any of the author’s
                    professed poems.</p>
                <p>Gait’s humour is broader and more contagious than Scott’s; and his pictures of
                    the sleepy life of old Scottish towns are unrivalled in literature. He is
                    generally called an imitator of Scott; but the <hi rend="italic">Annals of the
                    Parish</hi> existed in MS. before <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi> was published.
                    As Galt is preeminently an illustrator of west-country Scottish life, his range
                    may be said to be narrower than Scott’s; but within it he is supreme. It would
                    be difficult to overrate the immense services which Galt has rendered alike to
                    the history of the manners and to the history of the language of the Scottish
                    people.</p>
