                    enumerated below :—-</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gamaliel,</hi> or Rabban Gamliel the elder, as he is
                    invariably called in the Talmud to distinguish him from his grandson, Rabban
                    Gamaliel or Gamliel of Jabneh (Jamnia), was the son of Rabbi Simeon, and the
                    grandson of Rabbi Hillel. Of his biography little is known beyond the facts
                    that, early in the 1st century, he lived and taught in Jerusalem, where Saul of
                    Tarsus was for some time his pupil; and that he w as a member of the Sanhedrim,
                    which body he successfully counselled to moderation in their treatment of the
                    followers of Jesus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    criticisms of Baur and others upon the speech, as recorded in Acts V. 34-39, do
                    not affect the general fact as now stated.</p></note> He appears to have died
                    before the destruction of the city. The Talmudists speak of him as having
                    enjoyed the confidence of Cypros, the wife of Agrippa, and as having been
                    president of the Sanhedrim during the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and
                    Claudius; but the latter representation at least is certainly unhistorical, as
                    may be learned from the New Testament and from Josephus, where it is invariably
                    the high priest who presides over the council. Gamaliel the elder is also
                    represented by Jewish tradition as having in some respects modified the
                    provisions of the law with respect to divorce and marriages of widows, and as
                    having made some new arrangements with regard to the calendar; but there is
                    reason to believe that in this last statement he has been mistaken for Gamaliel
                    of Jabneh. The fact that he is spoken of in the records of Judaism as having
                    been the first of the seven “rabbans” (rabban being a honorific form of the
                    title rabbi) is of itself almost conclusive against the late and otherwise
                    improbable Christian tradition to the effect that he ultimately became a
                    Christian and received baptism at the hands of Peter and John <hi rend="italic"

                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gamaliel</hi> of Jabneh ranks with his grandfather,
                    Gamaliel the elder, as one of the seven great rabbans of the Talmudists. His
                    father also was named Simeon. On the death of Rabbi Johanan ben Zacai, Gamliel
                    was chosen to succeed him as head of the famous school <pb break="no"

                    shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem. For a considerable period after
                    that event Jabneh became in some sense the metropolis of Judaism, and Gamliel,
                    as head of the supreme judicial and legislative body which sat there, may be
                    said to have been the first nasi or “prince” of the rabbinical period. An
                    interesting account of his position ‘as legislator will be found in chapter xx.

                    visited Rome in the autumn of 95 A.D., and the Talmud abounds with references to
                    the incidents of that journey. Gamliel was the friend of Rabbi Akiba, and the
                    master of Aquila (the “Onkelos” of the Babylonian Talmud). He died about 115 <hi

                <p>3. A third <hi rend="smallcaps">Gamaliel,</hi> son of Jehudah-ha-Nasi, is
                    mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Aboth,</hi> ii. 2, as having specially insisted
                    on the neβe^sity of combining with the study of the law some active employment
                    in order to the maintenance of a healthy moral tone.</p>
