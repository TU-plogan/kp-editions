                <p><label type="entry">GOLD COAST</label>, a British colony in Western Africa
                    reconstituted on the 24th of July 1876 by a royal charter which defines it as
                    consisting of two settlements—(1) the Gold Coast proper, comprising “all places,
                    settlements, and territories which may at any time belong to us in Western
                    Africa, between the fifth degree of west longitude and the second degree of east
                    longitude; and (2) the settlement of Lagos, similarly comprising all possessions
                    between the second and fifth degrees of east longitude.” The charter appoints a
                    governor, establishes a legislative andan executive council, and authorizes the
                    appointment of judgesand other legal officers, &lt;fcc. Both the Gold Coast
                    colony and Lagos had previously been administered by lieutenant-governors
                    dependent on the governor of Sierra Leone; and the two divisions are still
                    sufficiently distinct to require separate treatment.</p>
                <p>By Bosman, the Dutch factor at Elmina in the beginning of the 18th century, the
                    Gold Coast is said to extend “about 60 miles, beginning with the Gold River, 3
                    miles .west of Assini, or 12 miles above Axim, and ending with the village

                    long.) being accepted as the western buundary, and the mouth of the Volta river
                    (0° 4Γ 2" E. long.) as the eastern, the whole coast measures about 225 miles,
                    and this is divided into two sections, the windward or western and the leaward
                    or eastern, the boundary between the two being the Secoom river (0° 3' 2" W.
                    long.). Beginning at the west, the first places on the coast that deserve to be
                    mentioned are Grand Bassam and Assini, both French settlements up to 1870. The
                    mouth of the river Assini forms the outlet of a series of lagoons, the eastmost
                    of which is fed by a considerable river —the Tanno or Tando. About 55 miles
                    eastward from this point are the Four Hills or Hummocks of Apollonia, where the
                    English formerly had a fort; and about 20 miles from Apollonia is the mouth of
                    the Ankobne. Three miles further and we come to Axim, the site of an old Dutch
                    fort built near the mouth of the Axim river; and other 20 miles and we reach
                    Great Friedrichsburg, founded by the Brandenburg Company. Rounding Cape Three
                    Points (2° 7' W. long.), whose vicinity is marked by a line of breakers nearly
                    2J miles long, the first place of importance that we find is Akodah or Aquidah,
                    and 10 miles beyond Akodah lies the better known Dixcove or Dick’s Cove. From
                    Dixcove Pompendi is distant 10 miles, and other 12 or 13 miles brings us to
                    Secondee, which is only 8 or 9 miles from the mouth of the Busum (or Sacred)
                    Prah. With the exception of the Volta this is the largest river of the Gold
                    Coast; it is on one of its sub-tributaries that Coomassee is situated. At the
                    mouth of the Beyah, 19 or 20 miles eastward, stands Elmina, or in the native
                    language Edenà, one of the most important posts of European settlement, with a
                    native population of some 10,000 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Elmina).</hi> Eight
                    miles east of Elmina is Cape Coast Castle, which was the capital of the British
                    territory until 1876. Anamaboe, 10 miles distant, is a town of some 4000 or 5000
                    inhabitants, with a free port and a good landing-place; and about 38 miles
                    further on we come to Winnebah, which up till 1812 was the seat of an English
                    fort. About 11 miles eastward there is another abandoned fort at Barrocoe; and
                    at Barrocoe we are only 23 miles from Acra or Accra (in Tshi Nkran), the present
                    capital of the Gold Coast colony. It was selected instead of Cape Coast Castle
                    on account of its comparatively healthy position. In the words of Dr A. F.
                    Elliot, it is the healthiest station on the west coast of Africa, being
                    surrounded for miles by fresh undulating ground, and backed at the distance of a
                    day’s journey, or about 30 miles, by a range of hills where Europeans can
                    recruit. A sanitary station has been fixed at Akropong, 1800 feet above the
                    sea-level, where the Basel missionaries have their headquarters. About 2 miles
                    east of Acra is the old Danish fort of Christiansborg. There is no station of
                    much importance except Tassi, Ponce, and Great Ningo or Ningua, in the 60 miles
                    between Acra and the Volta. The Volta, otherwise known as the Firaw, the Shilao,
                    or the Amu, is a large river, the course of which has been only partially
                    explored, but which may be expected to furnish a means of opening up the
                    interior. In December 1875, M. M. J. Bonnat, journeying partly by water and
                    partly by land, proceeded as far as Salaha or Paraha, a commercial town of some
                    18,000 inhabitants. He reports that the Labelle rapids, though 25 feet high, can
                    be ascended by steamers during the rains in September and October, because at
                    that season the river rises 50 feet. The lower part of the course is of
                    difficult navigation in the dry season owing to the shallows, Addah, on the
                    right bank of the river near its mouth; Quittah, the seat of a British fort; and
                    Jellah Coffi, a trading port, are the principal places on the coast between the
                    Volta and FIouhow, which lies at the eastmost extremity of the Volta lagoon.
                    According to the ordinary divisions we enter the Slave Coast when we proceed
                    east of the Volta.</p>

                <p>Such are the chief points of interest along the Gold Coast, hut there is a
                    considerable range of territory extending from 20 to 60 miles inland, which
                    belongs to the colonial protectorate; and about this a few words are necessary.
                    The western portion of the protectorate is occupied by the woody hill country of
                    Fanti, which stretches northwards towards Ashantee. From the mouth of the Secoom
                    a fine range varying in height from 1200 to 1500 or 1600 feet stretches N.N.E.,
                    and divides the eastern portion into two halves. Between the mountains and the
                    sea there are large stretches of prairie land, in which the grass grows to a
                    height of 10 or 12 feet.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the Gold Coast may be divided into two great classes—the Tshi
                    or Chee, a black type, and the Aera, a red type. The Fantis and Ashantis, both
                    belonging to the former class, have already been described in <hi

                    maintain existence by hunting, gold-digging, and the gathering of wood snails.
                    The capital of their country is Kyebi.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    European culture, are to be found in all the towns of the λVest African coast as
                    artisans and sailors. They are employed by the interior tribes as middle men and
                    interpreters. On the right bank of the Volta are the Adangme<note

                    are spoken in Assini, Amanahia (Apollonia), Awini, Ahanta, Wasaw, Tshuforo
                    (Juffer or Tufel), and Denkyera in the west, and in Asen, Akem, and Aquapem in
                    the east, as well as in the different parts of Ashantee. Fante dialects are
                    spoken, not only in Fantiproper, but in Afutu or the country round Cape Coast,
                    in Abora, Agymako, Akomfi, Gomoa, and Agona. The difference between the two
                    types is not very great; a Fanti, for example, can converse without much
                    difficulty with a native of Aquapem or Ashantee, his language being in fact a
                    deteriorated form of the same original. Akem is considered the finest and purest
                    of all the Akan dialects. The Aquapem, which is based on the Akem but has
                    imbibed Fanti influences, has been made the book-language by the Basel
                    missionaries. About a million people in all, it is estimated, speak dialects of
                    the Tshi. The south-eastern corner of the Gold Coast is occupied by another
                    language known as the Ga or Aera, which comprises the Ga proper and the Adangme
                    and Crobo dialects. Ga proper is spoken by about 40,000 people, including the
                    inhabitants of Ga and Kinkä (i.β., Dutch and British Aera, in Tshi, Nkran, and
                    Kankan), Osu <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Christiansborg), La, Tessi, Ningua,
                    and numerous inland villages. It has been reduced to writing by the
                    missionaries. The Adangme and Crobo dialects are spoken by about 80,000 people.
                    They differ very considerably from Ga proper, but books printed in Ga can be
                    used by both the Crobo and Adangme natives. Another language known as Gum is
                    used in parts of Aquapem and in Anum beyond the Volta; but not much is known
                    either about it or the Obutu tongue spoken in a few towns in Agona, Gomoa, and
                    Akomfi. The dialects of the Ahanta country have still to be investigated.<note

                <p>Mahometanism and Christianity are both making themselves felt to some extent
                    among the natives of the Gold Coast. A Danish mission was started at
                    Christiansborg about 1736 by Protten and Huckoff, the Moravian brethren. In 1835
                    the Wesleyan mission began its l.∙i&gt;ours among the Fanti. The Basel
                    missionaries had made a start in 1828, but it was not till 1835 that they were
                    fairly settled at Akropong, the capital of Aquapem. They now have stations also
                    at Kyebi, at Kukurantimy, at Abune, at Abokoli, at Addah, and at Aera, and the
                    leaders of the English expedition against the Ashantees speak very highly of
                    their labours.</p>
                <p>The climate of the Gold Coast is notoriously unhealthy. Ab Cape Coast Castle the
                    thermometer ranges from 72° to 85° or 90°, and the amount of moisture in the
                    atmosphere is very great. Not only are the coasts in many places lined with
                    swamps and lagoons, but, according to Dr Gordon, the very basis rock of the
                    country—a granite in which iron ore and hornblende are present—gives oft" under
                    the influence of the air and the rain large quantities of sulphuretted hydrogen
                    gas. The native towns are populous and dirty, and to add to the evil it was,
                    until the prohibition of the British authorities (at Elmina by Colonel Resting,
                    and at Cape Coast by Governor Strahan), the custom to bury the dead in the
                    floors of the houses. Intermittent fevers, remittent fevers (the so-called coast
                    fever is of this class), and dysentery are the diseases most to be dreaded by
                    the European. “The native inhabitants,” says Marcus Allen, “appear to enjoy
                    tolerable health and to live to an average age; but in the rainy season it is
                    not uncommon to find them suffering from pleuritis and pneumonia, rheumatic
                    attacks, bronchitis, and catarrh.”</p>
                <p>Though the precious dust to which the Gold Coast owes its name is no longer
                    obtained in any considerable quantities by the rude methods of collection
                    employed by the natives, there is abundant proof that the whole region is more
                    or less auriferous, and it is possible that European energy and skill might make
                    it again a real gold coast. In some parts of the country—in the neighbourhood of
                    the Volta, for example—the surface of the ground is broken by innumerable small
                    pits dug by the native miners.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the value of the territory is mainly due to the profusion of vegetable products
                    supplied by the rich alluvial soil. Of the timber trees which abound in the vast
                    stretches of forest, the best known are several species of the genus <hi

                    The cocoa-nut and the palm oil are common along the coast, and the bread-fruit
                    tree has been introduced with success at Napoleon. Indian corn, yams, cassava,

                    and forms an important article of export. Both tobacco and cotton are
                    indigenous, but neither is cultivated by the natives. Coffee and tobacco are
                    grown by the missionaries at Akropong.</p>
                <p>The exports are mainly gold dust, palm oil, and palm kernels; and the imports, in
                    exchange, dry goods from the United Kingdom, and tobacco and spirits from
                    America. In 1875 and 1876 the exports were respectively of the value of £327,012
                    and £465,268, and the corresponding imports amounted to £364,672 and £446,088.
                    The revenue of the Gold Coast, mainly derived from customs duties, was £67,368
                    in 1875, and £64,788 in 1876; the corresponding expenditures were £67,368 fur
                    1875, and £93,944 for 1876. There is no public debt.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of England on the Gold Coast was defined by the bond of the 6th
                    of March 1844, an agreement with the native chiefs by which Her Majesty receives
                    the right of trying criminals and repressing human sacrifices, pannyaring,
                    &amp;c. The limits of the protectorate inland were not very rigidly defined. The
                    purchase of the Danish forts in 1851, and of the Dutch forts and territory in
                    1871, led to the consolidation of the British power along the coast; and the
                    Ashantee war of 1873-74 resulted in the extension of the area of British
                    influence towards the interior. By the royal ordinances of December 1874 the
                    selling, buying, or dealing in slaves was declared unlawful, and no person can
                    any longer be put in pawn for debt; but those who were actually slaves at that
                    date are left in the same state, except where cruelty can be proved against the
