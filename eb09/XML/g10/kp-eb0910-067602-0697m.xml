                    rend="italic">γλαυκός,</hi> “silvery” or “sheeny”), in Greek mythology, the name
                    of several figures, the most important of which are the four described
                    below:—</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Glaucus,</hi> surnamedPontius (ό πόντιον, equivalent to
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">g</hi> θαλάσσιον), according to the common legend had
                    originally been an expert fisherman and diver at Anthedon (Boeotia),'but, having
                    eaten of the magical herb sown by Cronos, had leapt into the sea, where
                    ultimately he was changed into a god, and endowed with the gift of unerring
                    prophecy. A principal seat of his cultus was Anthedon, where the inhabitants
                    claimed to be descended from him; but he was also worshipped extensively, not
                    only on the coasts of Greece, but also on those of Sicily and Spain, it being
                    customary for fishermen and sailors at certain seasons to watch during the night
                    for the moment when he should come on his periodical rounds accompanied by his
                    train, in order that they might consult him as an oracle. He is generally
                    represented as endowed with most of the attributes of Nereus, but occasionally
                    he is identified with Melicertes. He is sometimes said to have instructed Apollo
                    in prophecy. In art he 13 depicted as a vigorous old man with long hair and
                    beard, his body terminating in a scaly tail. The <hi rend="italic">Argo·</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nautica</hi> represent Glaucus as having been builder and
                    steersman of the “Argo,” as having alone remained unhurt in the fight of Jason
                    with the Tyrrhenians, and as having afterwards become a sea god, in which
                    capacity he was able in various ways to assist the expedition. A poetical
                    account of his metamorphosis is given by Ovid <hi rend="italic">{Met.,</hi>
                    xiii. 906), and his story has been also treated by Pindar and by Aeschylus, the
                    latter of whom is known to have made Glaucus Pontius the subject of one of his
                    satyr-dramas (see Pausanias, ix. 22, 6; and compare Hermann, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Aeschyli</hi><hi rend="italic">Glaucis).</hi> Allusions to the loves of
                    Glaucus with Ariadne, Scylla, the Nereids, and Melicertes are frequently to be
                    met with in ancient literature; and a considerable quantity of folklore
                    concerning him will be found in the scholiast on Plato’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic,</hi> p. 536, and also in Athenaeus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deipηosoph.</hi> vii. 47, 48, See also Gädechen’s monograph <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Glaukos der Meergott,</hi> 1860).</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Glaucus,</hi> usually surnamed Potnieus (ό πoτvι∈υv),
                    from Potniae near Thebes, a deity worshipped chiefly in Corinth, is to be
                    carefully distinguished from Glaucus Pontius. He was the son of Sisyphus by
                    Merope, and the father of Bellerophon. According to the legend he was destroyed
                    by his own mares,—the most common form of the .story being that he was tom to
                    pieces by them. Accounts differ as to the place of his violent death, and also
                    as to the immediate occasion of it. Sometimes it is represented as having
                    happened at Iolcus, at the funeral games of Pelias, but usually the scene is
                    laid at Potniae. He is most frequently represented as having offended Aphrodite
                    by having kept his mares from breeding; but other versions of the myth are that
                    he had fed them on human flesh to make them more spirited, or that they had been
                    suffered to drink at a sacred well at Boeotia, or that they had eaten the herb
                    hippomanes. On the isthmus of Corinth, and also at Olympia and Nemea, he was
                    worshipped as ταρά£ιππος; and he was the subject of a lost tragedy of Aeschylus.
                    His affinities with Poseidon Hippius are obvious; and it may be taken for
                    granted that the frantic horses of Glaucus Potnieus represent the stormy waves
                    of the sea, just as Glaucus Pontius is himself a personification of the ocean in
                    its friendlier and calmer moods.</p>
                <p>(3.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Glaucus,</hi> the son of Minos by Pasiphae, when a
                    child, playing at ball or pursuing a mouse, fell into a honey pot and was
                    smothered. His father, after a vain search for him, consulted the oracle, and
                    was referred for an answer to the person who should suggest the aptest
                    comparison for one of the cows of Minos which had the power of assuming three
                    different colours. Polyidus (ΙΙολυϊδον) of Argos, who had likened it to a
                    mulberry (or bramble), which changes from white to red and then to black, soon
                    afterwards discovered the child. Minos then desired him to restore young Glaucus
                    to life; and on his failure in this, he was sentenced to be entombed alive along
                    with the corpse. Having in the sepulchre killed a serpent by which he had been
                    attacked, he saw its com panion revivify it by laying upon it a few leaves of a
                    certain herb. The same herb he successfully applied to Glaucus. This curious
                    myth is now very generally admitted to be of a solar character; but interpreters
                    are far from unanimous as to the significance of the various details. The story,
                    which is related by Apollodorus (iii. 3, 1), and also by Aelian, was a favourite
                    subject with poets and artists. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides are each of
                    them said to have treated it dramatically; and, according to Lucian, it was
                    often represented in mimic dances (Lucian, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Saltatione,</hi> 49; Weicker, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">riech.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tragoedie).</hi> In some of its features at least the my thus is found to be
                    very widely diffused. See Cox, <hi rend="italic">Aryan Mythology,</hi> i. 161;
                    Baring-Gould, <hi rend="italic">Myths of the Middle Ages,</hi> ii. 145.</p>
                <p>(4.j <hi rend="smallcaps">Glaucus,</hi> son of Hippolochus, and grandson of
                    Bellerophon, mythical progenitor of the kings of Ionia, was a ^Lycian prince
                    who, along with his brother Sarpedon, assisted Priam in the Trojan war. The
                    incident between Glaucus and Diomede, as related in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> is well known. He was afterwards slain by Ajax; but his body was
                    carried back to Lycia, as that of his brother had been. It seems probable that
                    these two sons of the Lycian land—the land of light—who leave it in youth, but
                    are carried thither again (by Hypnos and Thanatos) when their course is done,
                    originally were meant to represent respectively the creeping light of the early
                    dawn (Sarpedon) and the brightness of the open day (Glaukos).</p>
