                    lieutenantgovernorship of the North-Western Provinces, and included in the
                    Benares division. It is bounded on the N. by Azimgarh and Sâran, E. by Sâran, S.
                    by Shâhâbâd, and W. by Benares and Jaunpur. Ghâzipur forms part of the great
                    alluvial plain of the Ganges, which divides it into two unequal portions. The
                    northern subdivision lies between the Gumti and the Gogrâ, whose confluences
                    with the main stream mark its eastern and western limits respectively. The
                    southern tract is a much smaller strip of country, enclosed between the
                    Karamnâsa and the great river itself. No hill or natural eminence is to be found
                    in the district. A few lakes are scattered here and there, formed where the
                    rivers have deserted their ancient channels. The largest is that of Surâha, once
                    a northern bend of the Ganges, but now an almost isolated sheet of water, 5
                    miles long by about 4 broad.</p>
                <p>Ghâzipur is a closely cultivated district, and out of a total area of 2168 square
                    miles 1546 are actually under cultivation. The harvests are the same as those
                    common to the whole of the plain districts of the North-Western Provinces. The
                    census of 1872 returned a total population in Ghâzipur district of 1,345,570
                    souls (males 696,572, females 648,829), dwelling in 3725 villages or townships,
                    and inhabiting 285,007 houses. The Hindus numbered 1,221,810, or 90 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 per cent., and Mahometans, 123,455. Of the three
                    higher Hindu castes there were—Brâhmans, 123,012; Râjputs, 295,355; and Baniyâs,
                    49,538. The lower castes are represented by the Ahirs, 171,216; Châmârs,
                    122,075; Kâyasths, 22,480; and Kurmis, 18,136. Amongst the Mussulmans, the
                    Shaikhs numbered 26,940; Sayyids, 4525; Mughals, 570; and Pathâns, 18,452. The
                    district is rich, and in the eastern parts the soil is extremely fertile, so
                    that the cultivators are, on the whole, in easy circumstances. Sixteen towns
                    contain a population exceeding 5000, viz., Ghâzipur, 38,853; Mahatwar Khâs,
                    8975; Shiupur Diar, 9279; Gahmar, 9050; Sherpur, 7958; Riotipur, 9323; Bâra,
                    5424; Chit, 5821; Narhi, 5527; Bansdih, -7319; Rioti, 7700; Maniar, 5285;
                    Ballia, 8521; Bairia, 5589; Sonbarsa, 7162; and Rasra, 7261. The chief imports
                    into the district are English piece goods and thread, cotton, salt, spices, and
                    grain; the principal exports, country cloth, sugar, fuller’s earth, oil seeds,
                    and hides. The headquarters of the Government opium manufacture is at Ghâzipur
                    town. Carbonate of soda is manufactured from the reh or saline efflorescence of
                    the barren usαr plains, and largely exported. Saltpetre is also largely prepared
                    from the same source. The great trade route is the Ganges, but good roads
                    connect all the principal centres with each other. The East Indian Railway runs
                    for 24 miles through the district, with stations at Zamâniah, Dildarnagar, and
                    Gahmar. The total amount of imperial, local, and municipal revenue of the
                    district in 1876 was £200,000. Ghâzipur is said to be one of the hottest and
                    dampest districts in the North-Western Provinces. In 1869 the annual mean
                    temperature was 80° Fahr., the lowest monthly mean being 61° Fahr., in January,
                    and the highest 98°, in May. The average total rainfall for 11 years from 1860
                    to 1871 was 40 T inches, the maximum being 50 ‘5 inches, in 1861, and the
                    minimum 21’5 inches, in 1868.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ghâzipur</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Town,</hi> the capital of
                    the district, stands on the low alluvial northern bank of the Ganges, in 35° 23'
                    36" N. lat. and 83° 35' 13" E. long., covering an area of 416 acres, and with a
                    population in 1872 of 38,853. There is considerable trade in sugar, tobacco,
                    long cloth, and rose water. It is the headquarters of the Government opium
                    department, where all the opium from the North-Western Provinces is collected
                    and manufactured under a monopoly. A metalled road runs from Ghâzipur to
                    Zamâniah station on the East Indian Railway, 13⅜ miles. Lord Cornwallis, the
                    governor-general of India, died at Ghâzipur in 1805, and a monument and marble
                    statue are erected over his grave.</p>
