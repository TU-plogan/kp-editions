                    spelt it “Gairfowl.” Prof. Owen has adopted the form “Garfowl,” without, as

                    the Hebridean name of a large sea-bird, formerly a visitor to certain remote
                    Scottish islands, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Great Auk</hi> of most English
                    book-writers, and the <hi rend="italic">Alca impennis</hi> of Linnaeus. Of this
                    remarkable creature mention has been already made at some length <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. pp. 731, 735), but since the species has
                    a mournful history and several egregious misconceptions prevail concerning it, a
                    few more details may not be unacceptable, particularly as many of them have been
                    hitherto confined to works not easily accessible to the general reader, and the
                    presumed extinction of the bird gives it especial interest. In size it was
                    hardly less than a tame Goose, and in appearance it much resembled its smaller
                    and surviving relative the Razor-bill <hi rend="italic">{Alca torda)</hi>; but
                    the glossy black of its head was varied by a large patch of white occupying
                    nearly all the space between the eye and the bill, in place of the Razorbill’s
                    thin white line, while the bill itself bore eight or more deep transverse
                    grooves instead of the smaller number and the ivory-like mark possessed by the
                    species last named. Otherwise the coloration was similar in both, and there is
                    satisfactory evidence that the Gare-fowl’s wintér-plumage differed from that of
                    the breeding-season just as is ordinarily <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n88/mode/1up"

                    rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> to which it belongs. The most striking characteristic
                    of the Garefowl, however, was the comparatively abortive condition of its wings,
                    the distal portions of which, though the bird was just about twice the linear
                    dimensions of the Razor-bill, were almost exactly of the same size as in that
                    species—proving, if more direct evidence were wanting, its inability to fly.</p>
                <p>• - The most prevalent misconception concerning the Garefowl is one which has
                    been repeated so often, and in books of such generally good repute and wide
                    dispersal, that a successful refutation seems almost hopeless. This is the
                    notion that it was a bird possessing a very high northern range, and
                    consequently to be looked for by Arctic explorers. How this error arose would
                    take too long to tell, but the fact remains indisputable that, setting aside
                    general assertions resting on no evidence worthy of attention, there is but a
                    single record deserving any credit at all of a single exajnple of the species
                    having been observed within the Arctic Circle, and this, according to Prof.
                    Reinhardt, who has the best means of ascertaining the truth, is open to grave
                    doubt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The specimen is
                    in the Museum of Copenhagen; the doubt lies as to the locality where it was
                    obtained, whether at Disco, which is within, or at the Fiskernäs, which is
                    without, the Arctic Circle.</p></note> It is clear that the older ornithologists
                    let their imagination get the better of their knowedge or their judgment, and
                    their statements have been blindly repeated by most of their successors. Another
                    error which, if not so widely spread, is at least as serious, since Prof. Owen
                    <hi rend="italic">{Encyd. Brit.,</hi> ed. 8, xvii. p. 176; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaeontology,</hi> p. 400) has unhappily given it countenance, is that this
                    bird “has not been specially hunted down like the dodo and dinornis, but by
                    degrees has become more scarce.” Now, if any reliance can be placed upon the
                    testimony of former observers, the first part of this statement is absolutely
                    untrue. Of the Dodo all we know is that it flourished in Mauritius, its only
                    abode, at the time the island was discovered, and that some 200 years later it
                    had ceased to exist—the mode of its extinction being open to conjecture, and a
                    strong suspicion existing that though indirectly due to man’s acts it was
                    accomplished by his thoughtless agents <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi>
                    1869, p. 354). The extinction of the <hi rend="italic">Dinornis</hi> lies beyond
                    the range of recorded history. Supposing it even to have taken place at the very
                    latest period as yet suggested—and there is much to be urged in favour of such a
                    supposition—little but oral tradition remains to tell us how its extirpation was
                    effected. That it existed after New Zealand was inhabited by man is indeed
                    certain, and there is nothing extraordinary in the proved fact that the early
                    settlers (of whatever race they were) killed and ate Moas. But evidence that the
                    whole population of those birds was done to death by man, however likely it may
                    seem, is wholly wanting. The contrary is the case with the Gare-fowl. In Iceland
                    there is the testimony of a score of witnesses, taken down from their lips by
                    one of the most careful naturalists who ever lived, the late John Wolley, that
                    the latest survivors of the species were caught and killed by expeditions
                    expressly organized with the view of supplying the demands of caterers to the
                    various museums of Europe. In like manner the fact is incontestable that its
                    breeding-stations in the western part of the Atlantic were for three centuries
                    regularly visited and devastated with the combined objects of furnishing food or
                    bait to the fishermen from very early days, and its final extinction, according
                    to Sir Richard Bonny castle <hi rend="italic">{Newfoundland in</hi> 1842, i. p,
                    232) was owing to “the ruthless trade in its eggs and skin.” No doubt that one
                    of the chief stations of this species in Icelandic waters disappeared, as has
                    been before said <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi><hi rend="italic">loc.
                    cit.),</hi> through volcanic action—</p>
                <p>“A land, of old upheaven from the abyss</p>
                <p>By fire, to sink into the abyss again”—</p>
                <p>and that the destruction of the old Geirfuglaskér drove some at least of the
                    birds which frequented it to a rock nearer the mainland, where they were exposed
                    to danger from which they had in their former abode been comparatively free; yet
                    on this rock (Eldey*= fire-island) they were “specially hunted down” whenever
                    opportunity offered,until the stock there was wholly extirpated in 1844, and
                    whether any remain elsewhere must be deemed most doubtful.</p>
                <p>A third misapprehension is that entertained by Mr Gould who, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Birds of Great Britain,</hi> says that “formerly this bird was
                    plentiful in all the northern parts of the British Islands, particularly the
                    Orkneys and the Hebrides. At the commencement of the present century, however,
                    its fate appears to have been sealed; for though it doubtless existed, and
                    probably bred, up to the year 1830, its numbers annually diminished until they
                    became so few that the species could not hold its own.”</p>
                <p>Now of the Orkneys, we know that Low, who died in 1795, says in his
                    posthumously-published· <hi rend="italic">Fauna Orcademsis</hi> that he could
                    not find it was ever seen there; and on Bullock’s visit in 1812 he was told,
                    says Montagu <hi rend="italic">{Orn. Diet. App.),</hi> that one male only had
                    made its appearance for a long time. This bird he saw and unsuccessfully hunted,
                    but it was killed soon after his departure, while its mate had been killed just
                    before his arrival, and none have been seen there since. As to the Hebrides, St
                    Kilda is the only locality recorded for it, and the last example known to have
                    been obtained there, or in its neighbourhood, was that given to Fleming <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ediηb. Phil. Journ.,</hi> x. p. 96) in 1821 or 1822, having been
                    some time before captured by Mr Maclellan of Glass. That the Gare-fowl was not
                    plentiful in either group of islands is sufficiently obvious, as also is the
                    impossibility of its continuing to breed “up to the year 1830.”</p>
                <p>But mistakes like these are not confined to British authors. As on the death of
                    an ancient hero myths gathered round his memory as quickly as clouds round the
                    setting sun, so have stories, probable as well as impossible, accumulated over
                    the true history of this species, and it behoves the conscientious naturalist to
                    exercise more than common caution in sifting the truth from the large mass of
                    error. Americans have asserted that the specimen which belonged to Audubon (now
                    at Vassar College) was obtained by him on the banks of Newfoundland, though
                    there is Macgillivray’s distinct statement <hi rend="italic">{Brit. Birds,</hi>
                    v. p. 359) that Audubon procured it in London. The account given by Degland <hi
                    rend="italic">{Om. Europ.,</hi> ii. p. 529) in 1849, and repeated in the last
                    edition of his work by M. Gerbe, of its extinction in Orkney, is so manifestly
                    absurd that it deserves to be quoted in full:—“Il se trouvait en assez grand
                    nombre il y a une quinzaine d’années aux Orcades; mais le ministre presbytérien
                    dans le Mainland, en offrant une forte prime aux personnes qui lui apportaient
                    cet oiseau, a été cause de sa destruction sur ces îles.” The same author daims
                    the species as a visitor to the shores of France on the testimony of Hardy <hi
                    rend="italic">{Annuaire</hi><hi rend="italic">Normand,</hi> 1841, p. 298), which

                    rend="italic">{Naumanηia,</hi> 1855, p. 423), thereby misleading an anonymous

                    contribution to our knowledge of it that has appeared is a paper by Mr John
                    Milne, published in <hi rend="italic">The Field</hi> newspaper, and since
                    reprinted for private circulation, This gentleman visited Funk Island, one of

                    and natural mummies so lately as 1863 and 1864. Landing on this rock at the risk
                    of his life, he brought off a rich cargo of its remains, belonging to no fewer

                    had before been known. His collection has since been dispersed, most of the
                    specimens finding their way into various public museums in this country.</p>
