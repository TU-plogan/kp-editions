                    to Rome and the Roman provinces, was originally borrowed from Etruria is shown
                    by various indications. On an Etruscan tomb discovered at Tarquinii there is a
                    representation of gladiatorial games; the slaves employed to carry off the dead
                    bodies from the arena wore masks representing the Etruscan Charon; and we learn
                    from Isidore of Seville that the name for a trainer of gladiators, <hi
                    rend="italic">lanista,</hi> is an Etruscan word meaning butcher or executioner.
                    These games are evidently a survival of the practice of immolating slaves and
                    prisoners on the tomb of illustrious chieftains, a practice recorded in Greek,
                    Roman, and Scandinavian legends, and traceable even as late as this century in
                    the Indian suttee. Even at Rome they were for a long time confined to funerals,
                    and hence the older name for gladiators was <hi rend="italic">bustuarii;</hi>
                    but in the later days of the republic their original significance was forgotten,
                    and they formed a3 indispensable a part of the public amusements as the theatre
                    or the circus.</p>
                <p>The first gladiators are said, on the authority of Valerius Maximus, to have been
                    exhibited at Rome in the Forum Boarium 264 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> by
                    Marcus and Decimus Brutus at the funeral of their father. On this occasion only
                    three pairs fought, but the taste for these games spread rapidly, and the number
                    of combatants grew apace. In 174 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Titus Flamininus
                    celebrated his father’s obsequies by a three days’ fight, in which 74 gladiators
                    took part. Julius Caesar engaged such extravagant numbers for his aedileship,
                    that his political opponents took fright, and carried a decree of the senate
                    imposing a certain limit of numbers; but notwithstanding this restriction he was
                    able to exhibit no less than 300 couples. During the later days of the republic
                    the gladiators were a constant element of danger to the public peace. The more
                    turbulent spirits among the nobility had each his band of gladiators to act as a
                    body guard, and the armed troops of Clodius, Milo, and Catiline played the same
                    part in Roman history as the armed retainers of the feudal barons or the
                    condottieri of the Italian republics.</p>
                <p>Under the empire, notwithstanding sumptuary enactments, the passion for the arena
                    steadily increased. Augustus, indeed, limited the shows to two a year, and
                    forbade a praetor to exhibit more than 120 gladiators, yet allusions in Horace
                    and Persius show that 100 pairs was the fashionable number for private
                    entertainments; and in the Marmor Ancyranum the emperor states that more than
                    10,000 men had fought during his reign. The imbecile Claudius was devoted to
                    this pastime, and would sit from morning till night in his chair of state,
                    descending now and then to the arena to coax or force the reluctant gladiators
                    to resume their bloody work. Under Nero senators and even wellborn women
                    appeared as combatants; and Juvenal has handed down to eternal infamy the
                    descendant of the Gracchi that appeared without disguise as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >retiarius,</hi> and begged his life from the <hi rend="italic">secutor,</hi>
                    who blushed to conquer one so noble and so vile. Titus, whom his countrymen
                    surnamed the Clement, ordered a show which lasted 100 days; and Trajan, in
                    celebration of his triumph over Decebalus, exhibited 5000 pairs of gladiators.
                    Domitian instituted <hi rend="italic">venationes</hi> by torchlight, and at the
                    Saturnalia of 90 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> arranged a battle between dwarfs
                    and women. Even as late as 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> an edict was
                    passed forbidding women to fight. How widely the taste for these sanguinary
                    spectacles extended throughout the Roman provinces is attested by monuments,
                    inscriptions, and the remains of vast amphitheatres. From Britain to Syria there
                    was not a town of -any size that could not boast its arena and annual games. The
                    following inscription copied from the pedestal of a statue shows the important
                    part they played in provincial life :—“In four days, at Minturnae, he showed
                    eleven pairs of gladiators, who did not cease fighting till one half, all the
                    most valiant men in Campania, had fallen. You remember it well, noble fellow
                    citizens.” After Italy, Gaul, North Africa, and Spain were most famous for their
                    amphitheatres; and Greece was the only Roman province where the institution
                    never took root.</p>
                <p>Gladiators were commonly drawn either from prisoners of war, or slaves, or
                    criminals condemned to death. Thus <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0649-0632"/> in the first class we read of tatooed Britons in
                    their war chariots, Thracians with their peculiar bucklers and scimitars, Moors
                    from the villages round Atlas, and negroes from central Africa, exhibited in the
                    Colosseum. Down to the time of the empire only greater malefactors, such as
                    brigands and incendiaries, were condemned to the arena; but by Caligula,
                    Claudius, and Nero this punishment was extended to minor offences, such as fraud
                    and peculation, in order to supply the growing demand for victims. For the first
                    century of the empire it was lawful for masters to sell their slaves as
                    gladiators, but this was forbidden by Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. Besides these
                    three regular «lasses, the ranks were recruited by a considerable number of
                    freedmen and Roman citizens who had squandered their estates, and voluntarily
                    took the <hi rend="italic">auctoramentum gladiatorium,</hi> by which for a
                    stated time they bound themselves to the <hi rend="italic">lanista.</hi> Even
                    men of birth and fortune not seldom entered the lists, either for the pure love
                    of fighting, or to gratify the whim of some dissolute emperor; and one emperor,
                    Commodus, actually appeared in person in the arena.</p>
                <p>Gladiators were trained in schools <hi rend="italic">(ludi)</hi> owned either by
                    the state or by private citizens; and though the trade of a lanista was
                    considered disgraceful, to own gladiators and let them out for hire was reckoned
                    a legitimate branch of commerce. Thus Cicero, in his letters to Atticus,
                    congratulates his friend on the good bargain he had made in purchasing a band,
                    and urges that he might easily recoup himself by consenting to let them out
                    twice. Men recruited mainly from slaves and criminals, whose lives hung on a
                    thread, must have been more dangerous characters than modern galley slaves or
                    convicts; and, though highly fed and carefully tended, they were of necessity
                    subject to an iron discipline. In the school of gladiators discovered at
                    Pompeii, of the sixty-three skeletons buried in the cells many were in irons.
                    But hard as was the gladiator’s lot, —so hard that special precautions had to be
                    taken to prevent suicide,—it had its consolations. A successful gladiator
                    enjoyed far greater fame than any modern prize-fighter or athlete. He was
                    presented with broad pieces, chains, and jewelled helmets, such as may be seen
                    in the museum at Naples; poets like Martial sang his prowess; his portrait was
                    multiplied on vases, lamps, and gems; and high-born ladies contended for his
                    favours. Mixed, too, with the lowest dregs of the city, there must have been
                    many noble barbarians condemned to the vile trade by the hard fate of war. There
                    are few finer characters in Roman history than the Thracian Spartacus, who,
                    escaping with seventy of his comrades from the school of Lentulus at Capua, for
                    three years defied the legions of Rome; and after Antony’s defeat at Actium, the
                    only part of his aπny that remained faithful to his cause were the gladiators
                    whom he had enrolled at Cyzicus to grace his anticipated victory.</p>
                <p>There were various classes of gladiators, distinguished by their arms or modes of
                    fighting. The Samnites fought with the national weapons—a large oblong shield, a
                    vizard, a plumed helmet, and a short sword. The Thraces had a small round
                    buckler and a dagger carved like a scythe; they were generally pitted against
                    the Mirmillones, so called from the fish (p,op∕zυλoς) which served as the crest
                    of their helmet. In like manner the Retiarius was matched with the Secutor: the
                    former had nothing on but a short tunic or apron, and sought to entangle his
                    pursuer, who was fully armed, with the cast-net <hi rend="italic">(jaculum)</hi>
                    that he carried in his right hand; and if successful, he despatched him with the
                    trident <hi rend="italic">(tridens, fuscina)</hi> that he carried in his left.
                    We may also mention the Andabatae, who wore helmets with closed vizors; the
                    Dimachaeri of the later empire; the Essedarii, who fought from chariots like the
                    ancient Britons; the Hoplomachi, armed like a Greek hoplite; and the
                    Laqueatores, who tried to lasso their antagonists.</p>
                <p>The estimation in which gladiatorial games were held by Roman moralists deserves
                    notice, and the influence that they exercised upon the morals and genius of the
                    nation. The Roman was essentially cruel, not so much from spite or
                    vindictiveness, as from callousness and defective sympathies. This element of
                    inhumanity and brutality must have been deeply ingrained in the national
                    character to have allowed the games to become popular, but there can be no doubt
                    that it was fed and fostered by the savage form which their amusements took.
                    That the sight of bloodshed provokes a love of bloodshed and cruelty is a
                    commonplace of morals. To the horrors of the arena λve may attribute in part,
                    not only the brutal treatment of their slaves and prisoners, but the frequency
                    of suicide among the Romans. On the other hand, we should be careful not to
                    exaggerate the effects or draw too sweeping inferences from the prevalence of
                    this degrading amusement. Human nature is happily illogical; and we know that
                    many of the Roman statesmen who gave these games, and themselves enjoyed these
                    sights of blood, were in every other department of life
                    irreproachable,—indulgent fathers, humane generals, and mild rulers of
                    provinces. In the present state of society it is difficult to conceive how a man
                    of taste can have endured to gaze upon a scene of human butchery. Yet we should
                    remember that it is less than half a century since bear-baiting was prohibited
                    in England, and we are only now attaining that stage of morality in respect of
                    cruelty to animals that was reached in the 5th century, by the help of
                    Christianity, in respect of cruelty to men. We shall not then be greatly
                    surprised if hardly one of the Roman moralists is found to raise his voice
                    against this amusement, except on the score of extravagance. Cicero, in a
                    well-known passage commends the gladiatorial games as the best discipline
                    against the fear of death and suffering that can be presented to the eye. The
                    younger Pliny, who perhaps of all Romans approaches nearest to our ideal of a
                    cultured gentleman, speaks approvingly of them. Marcus Aurelius, though he did
                    much to mitigate their horrors, yet in his writings condemns the monotony rather
                    than the cruelty. Seneca is indeed a splendid exception, and his letter to
                    Lentulus is an eloquent protest against this inhuman sport. But it is without a
                    parallel till we come to the writings of the Christian fathers, Tertullian,
                    Lactantius, Cyprian, and Augustine. In the Confessions of the last there occurs
                    a narrative which is worth quoting as a proof of the strange fascination which
                    the games exercised even on a religious man and a Christian. He tells us how his
                    friend Alipius was dragged against his will to the amphitheatre, how he strove
                    to quiet his conscience by closing his eyes, how at some exciting crisis the
                    shouts of the whole assembly aroused his curiosity, how he looked and was lost,
                    grew drunk with the sight of blood, and returned again and again, knowing his
                    guilt yet unable to abstain. The first Christian emperor was persuaded to issue
                    an edict abolishing gladiatorial games (325), yet in 404 we read of an
                    exhibition of gladiators to celebrate the triumph of Honorius over the Goths,
                    and it is said that they were not totally extinct in the West till the time of
                    Theodoric (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Games).</hi></p>
                <p>Gladiators formed admirable models for the sculptor. One of the finest pieces of
                    ancient sculpture that has come down to us is the Wounded Gladiator of the
                    National Museum at Naples. The so-called Fighting Gladiator of the Borghese
                    collection, now in the Museum of the Louvre, and the Dying Gladiator of the
                    Capitoline Museum, which inspired the famous stanza of Childe Harold, have been
                    pronounced by modern antiquaries to represent, not gladiators, but warriors. In
                    this connexion we may mention the admirable picture of Gérome which bears the
                    title, Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant.</p>
                <p>The attention of archaeologists has been recently directed to the tesseroe of
                    gladiators. These tesserae, of which about sixty exist in various museums, are
                    small oblong tablets of ivory or bone, with an inscription on each of the four
                    sides. The first line contains a name in the nominative case, presumably that of
                    the gladiator; the second line a name in the genitive, that of the patronus or
                    dominus; the third line begins with the letters SP, for spectatus or approved,
                    which shows that the gladiator had passed his preliminary trials; this is
                    followed by a day of a Roman month; and in the fourth line are the names of the
                    consuls of a particular year.</p>
