                    son of Gruffydd Vychan, sprung from the lords of Bromfield, and through his
                    mother he claimed descent from a daughter of Llywelyn, the last crowned prince
                    of Wales. He was entered a member of one of the inns of court, and brought up to
                    the profession of the law, but he does not seem to have practised. In 1385, in
                    the great dispute between the Grosvenors and the Scropes as to their right to
                    bear a certain coat of arms, he was a witness for Grosvenor—one of the witnesses
                    for Scrope being the poet Chaucer. He found his way to court, where he became a
                    favourite with King Richard, and was made an esquire of his body. When Richard
                    went to Ireland Owen accompanied him, as he did also on his return to Wales. He
                    was present when Richard placed himself in the hands of the treacherous
                    Northumberland, and at Flint, where his deposition was decided upon. Owen
                    thereupon retired into private life. He had the misfortune to have for a
                    neighbour Reginald de Grey, earl of Ruthin; and between him and De Grey a feud
                    existed, occasioned by a dispute about a piece of waste land. In the time of
                    Richard, Owen was successful in a lawsuit; but no sooner was the king deposed
                    than De Grey took forcible possession of the land. Owen in vain appealed to
                    parliament, although the bishop of St Asaph entreated them to grant his request,
                    and warned them that if they did not, Wales would rise in rebellion; and a
                    little later Henry IV., on the ground that Owen, as a crown tenant, had
                    neglected to join an expedition to Scotland (while the fact was that the
                    summons, which had been entrusted to De Grey to give to Owen, was not delivered
                    until it was too late), declared a forfeiture of his land held of the crown, and
                    granted some of it to De Grey. With armed retainers De Grey took possession; but
                    Owen mustered his followers, and after regaining his own, devastated the lands
                    of De Grey. Henry took De Grey’s part, and Owen set both at defiance. On the
                    20th September 1400 Owen struck the first blow for the freedom of his country at
                    Ruthin, where a fair was being held. The town was burnt down. During that and
                    the following year Owen steadily added to his strength, and the king, although
                    he thrice invaded Wales at the head of a large army, failed to get at the enemy,
                    who retired to the mountain fastnesses. This, and the stormy weather which the
                    English seem to have invariably experienced, so awed them that they thought the
                    Welsh chieftain was allied with the powers of darkness. Harsh laws were enacted
                    against the Welsh, who thereby were only the more goaded to rebellion. The
                    lord-marchers sided with the king, and Sir Edward Mortimer, uncle of the earl of
                    March, gave Owen battle at Brynglas in Radnorshire, on June 22, 1402. 1100
                    Herefordshire men were left dead on the field, and Mortimer himself was made
                    prisoner. It was at this battle that the Welsh women were guilty, as Shakespeare
                    says, of inhuman conduct to the dead. This so alarmed the king that he invaded
                    Wales in the autumn with three armies, but nothing came of it. Ata parliament
                    held at Machynlleth, at the close of this year (1402), Owen was formally
                    proclaimed Prince of Wales. About this time it was that the first steps were
                    taken which secured the league between Owen, Mortimer, and Percy. Early in 1403
                    Prince Henry— Falstaff’s Hal—was appointed lieutenant of the king in Wales. He
                    led an army into North Wales and destroyed Owen’s residences, “and laid waste a
                    fine and populous country.” The next great event was the battle of Shrewsbury,
                    at which Percy was defeated. Glendower has been accused of having neglected aid
                    to his ally at this battle, but letters recently discovered exonerate him from
                    blame in this respect, as he was elsewhere at the time. Meanwhile Owen was
                    committing terrible ravages in the districts under the sway of the marchers, or
                    where Norman castles overawed the natives; and in 1404 he sent ambassadors— his
                    chancellor Griffith Young, and his brother-in-law John Hanmer—to Charles of
                    France, who entered into treaty to aid Owen. In pursuance of this treaty a large
                    force, under the command of Hugueville, landed at Milford Haven at the end of
                    July 1405. But meanwhile Owen had sustained two crushing defeats from the army
                    under Prince Henry, the first at Grosmont in Monmouthshire on the Γlth March,
                    and the second at Mynyddpwllmelin in Brecknockshire four days later. Still he
                    was able to muster a force to join the French contingent, and with them he
                    pushed on to the neighbourhood of Worcester, where the king met them but did not
                    fight, and the French returned home. Owen’s power appears to have suffered
                    irrevocably at the defeats of the spring. For years afterwards he carried on a
                    desultory warfare, but defections from his ranks so weakened his power that he
                    was no longer the dangerous enemy he had been. But he never submitted. In July
                    1415—fifteen years after the first outbreak—the king, now Henry V., authorizes
                    Sir Gilbert Talbot to treat with Owen, and to offer him and his followers free
                    pardon, “in case they should desire it.” A similar offer was made in February
                    1416. His death is believed to have taken place at the house of one of his
                    daughters in Monmouthshire, but there is no certainty as to either the date or
                    the place of his death.</p>
