                    limits in the neighbourhood of 75° E. long., and its eastern somewhere between
                    114° and 115°. Like many other geographical designations, the word is not only
                    of doubtful origin, but in conventional usage has modified its meaning.
                    According to Sir T. Douglas Forsyth, it is originally the Turki for “great”; and

                    proper name, but, like Shamo, as a general term for any sandy and desert piece
                    of country. This being the case, the great German geographer proposes to
                    displace the word Gobi in European usage by the Chinese Han-hai or Dry Sea,
                    suggestive as he says not only of the present appearance but also of the former
                    history of the region; but it is to be feared that the older designation has
                    become too familiar, and the disadvantages arising from its use are of too
                    recondite a character, to render it likely that his proposal will be generally
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>As a sea the Gobi or Han-hai must have been comparable in extent to the
                    Mediterranean, and the ancient coast-line can be pretty clearly recognized. In
                    its present state it may be divided into two distinct basins, the western taking
                    its name from the river Tarim or Tarym, and the eastern from the Chinese Shamo
                    or “Sand Desert.” The Dzungarian valley stretches westwards like a gulf. The
                    Tarim basin is bounded on the S. by the range of mountains which, under various
                    names applicable to different portions, such as the Kwen-lun and the Altyntag,
                    forms the northward rim of the great plateau of Thibet; on the west it comes up
                    to the spurs of the Pamir plateau, and on the north it lies along the foot of
                    the Thian Shan. If we measure from the source of any of its principal
                    tributaries, the Tarim must have a course of more than 1000 miles. The
                    head-waters rise in the mountains just named, and the more important of them in
                    the south and west. The Khot,an river and its confluent the Kara-Kash both
                    descend from the Karakorum mountains, and flow in a generally northward
                    direction; the Zarafshan or Yarkand River, rising in the same range, winds about
                    in the first part of its course so as to enter the Gobi almost from the west;
                    and the Kizil Su or Kashgar River has its numerous head streams in the Kizil
                    Yart mountains belonging to the Pamir plateau. The Aksai River and the Shah Yar
                    are the most important contributions from the Thian Shan. The course of all of
                    these rivers after they enter the Gobi is largely matter of conjecture, and all
                    that can be asserted with confidence is that they unite to form the Tarim, and
                    find their final goal in an inland lake. They have probably all reached a common
                    channel about 82° E. long.; but as the stream presses eastward it again breaks
                    up into numerous branches, the arrangement of which, except along the route
                    followed by Przhevalski, is still unknown. As it passes east the stream
                    gradually loses in volume by absorption, evaporation, and the demands of
                    riparian populations. In the neighbourhood of the Ugendarya, the breadth is
                    about 300 or 360 feet, and the depth about 20. The course of the Tarim lies much
                    nearer the northern side of the Gobi than the southern, but it gradually trends
                    south east, and at length passing through Lake Karaburan, loses itself in Lake
                    Chon Kul (7c., great lake) or Kara-Kurchin. This last lake is identified with
                    the famous Lob-nor, the position of which has been one of the outstanding
                    problems of comparative geography. Against the identification a number of
                    objections have been urged by Richthofen <hi rend="italic">{cf “</hi>
                    Bemerkungen zu den Ergebnissen von Öber-lieut. Prejewalski’s Reise”in <hi
                    rend="italic">Verh.d. Ges.für Erdk.,</hi> Berlin, 1878), the most important of
                    which are the prevailing tradition that the Lob-nor was a salt lake while the
                    Chon·Kul is fresh, and the fact that the Chinese maps place the Lob nor to the
                    north of the position assigned to the Chon Kul, which according to Przhevalski
                    lies about 39° 30' N. lat., immediately to the N. of the Altyntag range (13,000
                    to 11,000 feet high). The country through which the Lower Tarim flows is dreary
                    and monotonous. “In general,” reports the traveller, “the Lob-nor desert is the
                    wildest and most unfertile of all that I have yet seen in Asia; it is sadder
                    than the desert of Ala-Shan.” A meagre vegetation of tamarisks and reeds lines
                    the course of the river. Away towards the southwest there stretch, if we may
                    trust to native reports, those vast fields of drifting and treacherous sands
                    which have given so much of its terror to the legendary account of the desert of
                    Gobi. That the reports are in the main true, and that the legends are founded on
                    fact, appears to be rendered probable by the statements of Sir T. Douglas
                    Forsyth, who has contributed an interesting paper on the subject to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</hi> (187 6). The
                    population of the Tarim basin is scanty and poverty-stricken. On the Lower Tarim
                    there are nine villages with a total of 1200 souls. Cattle-rearing is more
                    general than agriculture, which indeed is of the most recent introduction, and
                    confines itself to barley and wheat. Mahometanism is the universal religion, and
                    the language appears to be identical with the Taranchi and the Sart.</p>
                <p>The Shamo or eastern basin is cpιite different in its character. Here we have no
                    large river like the Tarim, and, instead of its boundaries being marked by lofty
                    ranges of mountains from 13,000 to 20,000 feet high, the ground gradually rises
                    in a series of scarcely marked terraces. The central point, at Ozon Khoshu, is
                    the lowest discovered in Central Asia, being only 607 metres (1948 feet) above
                    the level of the sea. “The aspect of the country,” says Ney Elias, “who crossed
                    in a north-westerly direction from China, is that of low hills or downs, with
                    valleysandplains intervening, the whole of a rocky or stony nature rather than
                    sandy, though patches of sand do occur every here and there. What little
                    vegetation exists is chiefly composed of weeds, ‘ scrub,’ and heath, there being
                    scarcely any grass, and only a dwarfed and stunted tree here and there, in the
                    gorges or passes of those low rocky ranges that at uncertain intervals cross the
                    desert in almost parallel lines from east to west.” Of the western portion of
                    the basin we have no modern account.</p>
                <p>Marco Polo was the first European who gave a distinct description of the desert
                    of Gobi. He tells ns how on quitting Charchan (the modern Chachan, according to
                    Yule) “you ride some five days through the sands finding none but bad and bitter
                    water; and then you come to a city called Lop at the edge of the desert .... The
                    length of the desert is so great that it would take a year and more to ride from
                    one end of it to the other. It is all composed of hills and valleys of sand.”
                    And then he goes on to speak of spirits that haunt the waste, and syllable men’s
                    names, and of strange noises like the tramp and hum of a great cavalcade, of the
                    sound of drums, and a variety of musical instruments. Polo appears to have
                    proceeded east from Khotan to Lob, and then further east to Etsina on the
                    southern edge of the desert, and afterwards to have spent forty days in crossing
                    the desert northwards to Karakorum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (1692-94), and by Lorenz Lange, who was sent in 1727-28 and in 1736 by Peter the

                    that accurate information began to accumulate about the eastern portions, and

                    in his explorations. In 1830-31 Fuss and Bunge crossed the eastern Gobi from
                    Urga to Kalgan; and Dr Fritsche executed a series of journeys in the same
                    district between 1869 and 1873.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Government topographer Matusovski, made valuable observations on the route from
