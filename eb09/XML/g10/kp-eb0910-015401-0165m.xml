                    >Janua,</hi> and in French <hi rend="italic">Genes,</hi> one of the most
                    important cities of Italy, is situated in what was formerly known as Liguria, on
                    the northern coast of the Mediterranean near the middle of the Gulf of Genoa.
                    The latitude of its lighthouse is 44° 24' 16" N., and its longitude 8° 54' 15"
                    E. By rail Genoa is 115 English miles N.E. of Nice and 119 miles N.W. of
                    Leghorn. The city, as seen from the sea, is “built nobly,” and deserves the
                    title it has acquired or assumed of the Superb. Finding only a small space of
                    level ground along the shore, it has been obliged to climb the lower hills of
                    the Ligurian Alps, which afford many a coign of vantage for the effective
                    display of its architectural magnificence. The original nucleus of the city is
                    that portion which lies to the east of the port in the neighbourhood of the old
                    pier (Molo Vecchio).’ In the 1Oth century it began to feel a lack of room within
                    the limits of its fortifications; and accordingly, in the middle of the 12th
                    century, it was found necessary to extend the line of circumvallation. Even this
                    second circuit, however, was of small compass, and it was not till 1320-30 that
                    a third line took in the greater part of the modern site of the city proper.
                    This presented about 3 miles of rampart towards the land side, and can still be
                    easily traced from point to point through the city, though large portions,
                    especially towards the east, have been dismantled. The present line of
                    circumvallation dates from 1626-1632, the period when the independence of Genoa
                    was threatened by the dukes of Savoy. From the mouth of the Bisagno in the east,
                    and from the lighthouse point in the west, it stretches inland over hill and
                    dale to the great fort of Sperone, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Spur, on the
                    summits of Monte Peraldo at a height of 1650 feet,—the circuit being little less
                    than 12 miles, and all the important points along the line being defended by
                    forts or batteries. Of course a large portion of the enclosed area is open
                    country, dotted only here and there with houses and gardens. There are eight
                    gates in all,—the more important being PortaPila and Porta Romana towards the
                    east, and the new Porta Lanterna or Lighthouse Gate to the west.</p>
                <p>The irregular relief of its site, and its long confinement within the limit of
                    fortifications which it had outgrown, have both contributed to render Genoa a
                    picturesque confusion of narrow streets, lanes, and alleys, which it would
                    almost require the delicate diminutives of Italian to name, varied with
                    stairways climbing the steeper slopes, and bridges spanning the deeper valleys.
                    As there are large portions of the town which are quite inaccessible to ordinary
                    carriages, and many even of the more important streetshave very little room for
                    traffic, porters and chairs take to a considerable extent the place of cabs, and
                    goods are largely transported by means of mules. In the middle of the 16th
                    century the Government gave commencement to a system of more spacious
                    thoroughfares than had previously been in vogue by laying out the street which
                    still bears the name of Via Nuova; in 1606 the Via Balbi, as it was ultimately
                    called from the palaces of the Balbi family, began to stretch westwards; and at
                    length, about 1778, a connexion between these two streets was effected by the
                    opening up of Via Nuovissima. The line thus produced, extending as it does from
                    the Piazza Fontane Morose westward for about a mile to the Piazza Verde is still
                    the route most in favouι∙ with the fashionable world of Genoa. As early as the
                    middle of the 17th century the Via Giulia was driven through the midst of the
                    small streets between the ducal palace and the Porta d’Arco; but it was not till
                    about 1825 that the Via Carlo Felice gave free route between the palace and the
                    Piazza Fontane Morose. The Via Lorenzo and the long line of street which, under
                    the names of Carlo Alberto, S. Benedetto, and Milano, runs round the port to its
                    western extremity, also belong to this century. The spacious Via Roma, running
                    east from Via Carlo Felice to meet the Via Assarotti, has been built since 1870;
                    and the area of the Piazza Cavour was only about the same time cleared of the
                    old houses. The great public promenade of Acquasola already mentioned was laid
                    out by the architect Carlo Barabino between 1821 and 1837; and it has been
                    connected with the gardens of the Villetta di Negri, purchased by the
                    municipality about 1865.</p>
                <p>Of the churches of Genoa, which number upwards of eighty, the principal is the
                    cathedral of St Laurence (il duomo di San Lorenzo). Tradition makes its first
                    foundation contemporary with St Laurence himself; there is distinct historic
                    mention of a church on the site in the latter part of the 9th century; and a
                    document of 987 implies that it was even then the metropolitan church.
                    Reconstructed about the end of the 11 th and beginning of the 12th century, it
                    was formally consecrated by Pope Gelasius II., 18th October 1118; and since then
                    it has undergone a large number of extensive though partial renovations. In the
                    façade the lower part, with its three elaborate doorways in the Gothicυ-Moorisħ
                    style, dates from the 12th century; the upper part belongs to the 14th; and, the
                    belfry which rises above the right-hand doorway was erected about 1520 by the
                    doge, Ottaviano da Campo-fragoso. To the 13th century is assigned the central
                    nave, which was, however, both lengthened and heightened in the 14th; and the
                    cupola was erected after the designs of the architect Galeasso Alessi invited to
                    Genoa about 1550. Among the artists who have contributed to the internal
                    decoration the most noteworthy are Damiano of Bergamo, who represented the
                    Slaughter of the Innocents and the Martyrdom of St Laurence in the woodwork of
                    the choir; Lazzaro Tavarone, who painted the roof about 1622; G. B. Bianco, who
                    furnished the bronze statue of the Madonna of the city in 1652; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n166/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0166-0155"/> Gian Giacomo della Porta, the sculptor of the
                    statues of Mark and Luke in the presbyterium; and Giovanni Maria Pas3al0 and
                    Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, the sculptors of the corresponding statues of
                    Matthew and John. The stained glass windows of the choir, representing the four
                    patron saints of the city, are the work of Giovanni Bertini. To none of the
                    chapels in the cathedral, rich as several of them are in works of artistic
                    value, can a higher rank be assigned than to the chapel of St John the Baptist.
                    The main design, with its elaborate detail of columns and arabesques, and
                    foliage and statues, was due to Pio Domenico da Bissone, who from 1450 was
                    engaged for ten years on the work. Statues by Matteo Civitali of Lucca and
                    Andrea Contucci of Monte San Savino, a rich and costly baldachin presented by
                    Count Filippino Doria, and stained glass windows designed by Ulisse de’ Mattei,
                    are among the later additions to its decoration. On one day only in the course
                    of the year are women allowed to enter the chapel; for was it not a woman who
                    procured the death of the Baptist? Amid the profusion of ecclesiastical
                    bric-a-brac in the nooks and niches of the cathedral, there are objects enough
                    of considerable interest. Here, bound together by craft of goldsmith, is an
                    octagonal bowl, brought from Caesarea in 1101, which corresponds to the
                    descriptions given of the Holy Grail, and was long regarded as an emerald of
                    matchless price, but which turned out, when broken by its French purloinere, to
                    be only a remarkable piece of ancient glass.</p>
                <p>Of older date than the cathedral is the church of St Ambrose and St Peter, if its
                    first foundation be correctly assigned to the Milanese bishop Honoratus of the
                    6th century; but the present edifice is due to the Society of Jesus, who
                    obtained possession of the church in 1587, and employed the skill of Pellegrino
                    Tebaldi in its restoration. Among the paintings of this church the first place
                    is naturally given to the Circumcision and St Ignatius by Rubens, and to the
                    Assumption of Guido Reni. The Annunziata del Guastato is one of the largest and
                    wealthiest churches in the city. It owes its first foundation to the order of
                    the Humiliati, but S. Marta, as it was originally called, was a small building
                    till it passed about 1505 into the hands of the Conventuals of St Francis, by
                    whom the present gigantic structure was planned and partly erected. The rest of
                    the main edifice was due to the Observartines of the same order, who came into
                    possession in 1537, and gave the church its modern name; and the necessary funds
                    were largely supplied by the Lomellini family. The church is a cruciform
                    structure, with a dome, and the central nave is supported by fourteen columns in
                    the Corinthian style. To the unfinished brick façade an incongruous portal with
                    marble columns was added about 1843, after the plans of Carlo Barabino. Santa
                    Maria delie Vigne probably dates from the 9th century, but the present structure
                    was erected towards the close of the 16th. The campanile, however, is a
                    remarkable work of the 13th century. San Siro, originally the “Church of the
                    Apostles” and the cathedral of Genoa, was rebuilt by the Benedictines in the
                    11th century, and restored and enlarged by the Theatines in the 16th. Santa
                    Maria di Carignano, or more correctly Santa Maria Assunta e SS. Fabiano e
                    Sebastiano, belongs mainly to the 16tħ century, and was designed by Galeazzo
                    Alessi, in imitation of Bramante’s plan for St Peter’s at Rome. The expense was
                    borne by the Sauli family. From the highest gallery of the dome—368 feet above
                    the sea-level, and 194 feet above the ground—a magnificent view is obtained of
                    the city and the neighbouring coast. S. Stefano dates from 969, and keeps its
                    ancient campanile, but it has been <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0167-0156"/> several times rebuilt. Tiιe famous painting of
                    the martyrdom of St Stephen, by Giulio Romano, carried off by Napoleon in 1811,
                    was restored to the church in 1815. The Madalena, as it now stands, was built by
                    Andrea Vannone about the close of the 16th century; and San Filippo Neri was
                    rebuilt in the close of the 17th century at the expense of the Pallavicini
                    family. S. Matteo, the church of the D’Oria or Doria family, was founded in 1126
                    by Martino Doria, and the present edifice, after the designs of Montorsoli,
                    dates from 1543. In the crypt is the tomb of Andrea Doria the Great by the same
                    Montorsoli, and above the main altar hangs the dagger presented to the doge by
                    Pope Paul III.</p>
                <p>The palaces of the Genoese patricians are famous for their sumptuous architecture
                    and their artistic collections. The Palazzo Rosso, or Red Palace, erected in the
                    middle of the 17th century, was in 1874 presented to the city by Maria, the wife
                    of Raffaele de Ferrari, duke of Galliera, and her son Filippo de Ferrari, along
                    with its library and picture gallery. The old palace of the doges, now the seat
                    of the prefecture, was rebuilt in the 16th century, and again restored after a
                    great fire in 1777; the neighbouring tower, from which the magistrates were
                    summoned by toll of bell, dates from the beginning of the 14th century. A
                    sixteenth century palace, formerly the property of the dukes of Turin, is now
                    occupied by the municipality, and contains among its more curious treasures a
                    bronze tablet (117 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> with an inscription relating
                    to a dispute between Genoa and a neighbouring castle, two autograph letters of
                    Columbus, and Paganini’s violin. The inscription, discovered in 1506, was
                    printed for the first time in 1520 by Brucelli, whose works form part of
                    Graevius’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus,</hi> and among its modern commentators
                    are Serra in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Genoa, and Simoni and
                    Grassi in the Transactions of the Ligurian Society of Native History. The palace
                    which was presented in 1528 by the republic to Andrea Doria is a large building
                    of the 15th century, restored and extended under the doge’s direction, and
                    decorated with frescos by Perino del Vaga. The royal palace, built in the middle
                    of the 16th century for the Durazzo family, was acquired by Victor Emmanuel in
                    1817. Among other buildings of the same class, the Durazzo palaces in the Via
                    Nuovissima, and the Via Balbi, the Balbi Senarega in the Via Balbi, the Sarra
                    palace in the Via Nuova, and the Pallavicino in the Piazza Fontane Morose are
                    worthy of note.</p>
                <p>Of most historical interest among the benevolent institutions of Genoa is the
                    hospital of Pammatone (Ospedale civile di Pammatone), a vast edifice contiguous
                    to the public park of Acquasola. It owes its origin to the bequest in 1429 of
                    Bartolommeo Bosco; and the excellence of the infirmary thus established caused
                    the citizens to procure permission from Sixtus V. to divert the funds of all
                    similar minor foundations to its support. New buildings were erected in 1626 by
                    Giacomo Saluzzo, and still larger additions were made in 1758, under the
                    superintendence of Andrea Orsolino. Under the same committee with the general
                    hospital is the hospital for incurables (Ospedale dei Cronici, originally
                    Ridotto degli Incurabili), instituted towards the end of the 15th century by
                    Ettore Vernazza, and taken under the direct control of the civil authorities in
                    1500. The great poorhouse (Albergo dei Poveri), dating from about 1665, is a
                    vast building, after designs by Stefano Scaniglia, covering no less than 215,280
                    square feet, and accommodating 1400 inmates, who manufacture cotton and woollen
                    cloth, furniture, embroidery, &amp;c. The so-called Conservatorio delle
                    Fieschine was founded in 1763, in accordance with the will of Domenico Fieschi,
                    as an asylum for destitute girls; and in 1783 his widow left 80,000 lire to
                    provide a dowry of 500 lire for any of the inmates leaving the institution to be
                    married or to take the veil. A considerable reputation has been acquired by the
                    flower-makers of this institution.</p>
                <p>The sums bequeathed for charitable purposes during 1863-75 amounted to 3,798,106
                    francs, in addition to the immense donations (about thirty millions of francs)
                    of the deceased duke of Galliera.</p>
                <p>The highest educational institution in Genoa is the royal university, which
                    occupies a palace in the Via Balbi, originally built about 1623 for the Jesuit
                    fathers entnιsted by the magistrates with the supervision of education in 1572.
                    The republic had received the right of conferring degrees from Pope Sixtus IV.
                    as early as 1471, a privilege confirmed by the emperor Maximilian I. in 1496. On
                    the dissolution of the Jesuits the administration of the college passed into the
                    hands of the republic, and the provisional Government of 1797 reinaugurated it
                    as a university in 1803. In 1808, during the French occupation, it was
                    assimilated to the other imperial academies, so that its present organization
                    may be said to date only from 1812. It numbers about 400 students, who have the
                    advantage of a physical and a natural history museum, an anatomical cabinet, a
                    meteorological observatory, a botanical garden, and a library. The library,
                    originated by the Jesuits, numbers about 80,000 volumes, among which none is
                    considered of greater value by the Genoese than the manuscript collection of the

                    Jαnucnsis.</hi> In Genoa, as elsewhere in Italy, great advance has been made
                    both in secondary and primary education since 1867: in 1877 the city possessed
                    two gymnasiums, a lyceum named after Christopher Columbus, three technical
                    schools, a high school for female education opened by the municipality in 1874,
                    a female normal school dating from 1859, a teachers’ training school founded in
                    1861, and upwards of 40 infant schools (Asili d’ Infanzia), of which the first
                    was opened in 1840. The royal technical institute comprises three distinct
                    sections—a professional industrial institute, an institute of mercantile marine,
                    and a system of evening classes in mathematics, chemistry, mechanics, &amp;c.;
                    and a royal naval college was opened in 1873. The Ligurian academy of the fine
                    arts owed its origin in 1751 to Francesco Maria Doria, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >p&gt;ala~zo</hi> in which its museums and galleries are situated was erected in
                    1831 by Carlo Barabino. A musical institute, founded by Antonio Costa and
                    maintained by the municipality, has rooms in the convent of St Philip Neri. A
                    society for the promotion of the fine arts dates from 1849, the Ligurian society
                    of native history from 1857, and a society for the arts and industries of
                    Liguria from 1871. Besides the university library there are four public
                    libraries—the Biblioteca Civico-Berian a (40,000), presented to the municipality
                    by Victor Emmanuel I., to whom it had been bequeathed; the Biblioteca della
                    Missione Urbana (40,000), a noble collection rich in manuscripts of Ligurian
                    history and Greek codices, which owes its origin to the legacy of Gerolamo
                    Franzone in 1727; the Biblioteca Franzoniana (12,000), due to the same G.
                    Franzone. and administered by the congregation of “Evangelical Workmen”; and,
                    lastly, the fine library which forms part of the great legacy in the Palazzo
                    Rosso. A museum of natural history (Museo Civico di St. Nat.), opened in the
                    Villetta di Negro in 1873, is worthy of special note for the collections made by
                    Giacomo Doria, Beccari, D’Albertis, and Antinori. Picture galleries are to be
                    found in many of the ancient palaces, and in two at least, the Palazzo Rosso and
                    the Palazzo Bianco, the collections are of great value. An excellent law forbids
                    the removal from the city or province of any object of ancient art without the
                    sanction of a commission under the presidency of the prefect. In 1877 the
                    Genoese had a choice of about a dozen theatres, small and great, inclusive of
                    those in Sampierdarena. Of these the greatest is the Carlo Felice, erected in
                    1826-28 under the patronage of the king whose name it bears. The National
                    Theatre, rebuilt in 1790, dates originally from 1702, and it has an older rival
                    in the Teatro del Falcone, which is associated with the life of Goldoni, and now
                    serves as court theatre.</p>
                <p>The mountainous character of the surrounding country has rendered it a difficult
                    task to supply Genoa with sufficient means of railway communication; in the 20
                    miles, for example, between the city and Arquata there are eleven tunnels, that
                    of Giovi being upwards of 2 miles long. The line to the north through the valley
                    of the Polcevera, which joins the general Italian system at Alessandria, was
                    opened about 1853; but it was not till 1870 that the western line was completed
                    so as to give a continuous route from France, and it was November 1874 before
                    the eastern section between Sestri di Levante and Spezia established a connexion
                    with the lines along the western coast of Italy. Since that date, however,
                    passengers and goods can be conveyed by rail from Calais to Otranto. There are
                    two stations in the city,—one for the west and north, and the other for the east
                    and south,—connected since 1871 by a tunnel 7518 feet in length.</p>
                <p>Though its existence as a maritime power was originally due to its port, Genoa
                    has only begun since 1870 to construct the conveniences necessary for the modern
                    development of its trade. As early as 1134 the old pier (Molo Vecchio) was in
                    existence, stretching westward into the gulf; and in 1639 the new pier (Molo
                    Nuovo) from the other side of the gulf was commenced, after the plans of Ansaldo
                    de Mari. Up to 1878 the former had a length of 2800 feet, and the latter was
                    only slightly longer. The harbour thus formed was in some respects a good one;
                    the bottom being of clay furnished excellent anchorage, and within the new pier
                    there was depth for the largest class of vessels. But a swell was always felt
                    whenever the wind was at any point between S.W. and S.E.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n168/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0168-0157"/>
                <p>The vast bequests of the duke of Galliera have enabled the authorities to
                    undertake (1878) an elaborate scheme for the extension and improvement of the
                    port, including, not only a great addition of the harbour area, but also the
                    construction of a system of wharves and warehouses, which have hitherto been
                    surprisingly insufficient. It is difficult to believe that in one of the
                    greatest harbours of Europe the goods should be “discharged into lighters,
                    slowly towed by rowing boats to the side of the quays, removed by hand labour
                    from the lighters to uncovered quays, and again transferred by hand labour tι
                    the railway.” In spite of all these disadvantages the shipping trade of Genoa
                    has rapidly increased since the consolidation of Italy. From 1815 to 1825 there
                    was a large trade in grain, with a corresponding expansion of other branches. A
                    sudden change was produced by a system of differential duties in favour of
                    native grain; instead of 1000 foreign vessels with a tonnage of 95,000 as in
                    1821-5, there were only 760 vessels on an average in the three years 1825-8; and
                    there was no corresponding increase in native shipping, which rose only from 55
                    to 70 vessels. The more liberal tariffs attached to the commercial treaties,
                    concluded about 1852 with France, England, and Germany, gave a new impulse to
                    foreign trade, and this -was followed up by Count Cavour’s law exempting all
                    foreign grain from duty. The principal imports are petroleum, raw cotton, wool,
                    grain, coal, metal goods, hides, tobacco, and English-cured fish. The total
                    value imported in 1876 was £14,324,347, and in 1877 £12,066,911, while the
                    exports for the same years amounted to £2,088,578 and £1,968,503—exclusive in
                    both cases of goods merely in transit. During the five years 1873-7 the total
                    number of vessels arriving at Genoa was on an average 2633 per annum, with an
                    annual tonnage of more than 1,000,000 tons. Of these vessels about 1510 per
                    annum sailed under the Italian flag with 533,900 tons; 421 were English with
                    284,390 tons, and 320 French with 105,945 tons. The opening of the St Gotthard
                    Bailway is expected to give a great impulse to Genoese trade.</p>
                <p>The local industry devotes itself mainly to the manufacture of cotton and silk,
                    gold, silver, ivory, and coral, paper and leather goods, macaroni and
                    vermicelli, sugar, and preserved fruits. The coarser cotton cloths or bordatti
                    are the favourite wear of the Ligurian population. Iron-founding and
                    shipbuilding are carried on in the district, and there is a growing export trade
                    in all articles of market gardening and floriculture.</p>
                <p>In Michelet’s phrase, it may almost be said that Genoa was a bank before it was a
                    city, and its money business is still greater than that of any other town in
                    Italy. The Bank of St George, founded in 1407, was “one of the most ancient and
                    celebrated banks of circulation and deposit in Europe," but it never recovered
                    from the damage done to its credit by the appropriation of its treasure, first
                    by the Austrians in 1740, and again by the French in 1800. It no longer exists,
                    and the famous building of the 13th century in which it was accommodated is now
                    used as a customs house. A new bank was founded at Genoa in 1844, which, since
                    its union in 1855 with a similar institution at Turin, bears the name of the
                    National Bank. It has branches at Turin, Florence, Milan, and Naples. Up till
                    1871 its only important rival was the Cassa di Sconto, but about this time the
                    Genoese, in the words of the British consul, “went mad on the subject of new
                    companies, and in a single year they started not less than thirty-three banking,
                    trading, mining, shipping, and manufacturing concerns.” The result was a series
                    of bankruptcies. Bank after· bank failed; and criminal proceedings were in
                    several cases instituted against the bank directors. The only notes current in
                    Genoa in 1875 were those of the National Bank and the Tuscan National Bank.</p>
                <p>The Genoese have long been known as a hard-working and frugal people; and the
                    lower classes of the whole Ligurian coast are inured to privation and hardships.
                    Since about 1850 there has been a strong current of emigration to South America.
                    About 1858 the Ligurian settlers in Monte Video, Buenos Ayres, Rio de la Plata,
                    Rio Janeiro, Lima, and Valparaiso were estimated at 60,000; and since that date
                    the number of emigrants leaving northern Italy by way of Genoa has increased to
                    80,000 or 90,000 per annum. A very considerable proportion of this number return
                    to their native country in their latter years, and the successful adventurer
                    usually assists his younger brethren to follow in his footsteps. A large trade
                    has sprung up with South America, the newest feature of which is an exportation
                    of Piedmontese wine.</p>
                <p>According to the returns of 1876, the income of Genoa was 6,343,175 francs,
                    including octroi dues for 4,326,000 francs. The ordinary, extraordinary, and
                    casual expenses for 1875 were—for municipal administration, 608,461 francs;
                    local police and sanitary expenses, 1,038,418; administration of law, 227,376;
                    public works, 2,312,470; education, 692,662; religious worship, 12,117; and
                    public charitie3, 648,468 francs. The debt of the city in 1876 was 36,731,457
                    francs.</p>
                <p>The council directing the local government of the city is chosen by a body,
                    according to the last returns, of 41,984 electors, every citizen paying 40
                    franc3 of taxes being entitled to vote, and every voter being eligible as a
                    councillor. The head of the cc·uncil is the syndic or mayor, chosen by the king
                    from the 12 members of the giunta or administrative committee, who are
                    themselves appointed from the entire body of the 60 municipal councillors.
                    Besides possessing this municipal council, Genoa is also the seat of the
                    provincial council, elected in the same way, but presided over by the prefect,
                    or representative of the Government.</p>
                <p>In 1848 the population of the city was 100,382; by 1862 it had increased to
                    127,986, but a careful census undertaken by the municipality in 1871 found no
                    more than 120,595, exclusive, however, both of resident strangers and absent
                    natives. The principal causes which had tended to retard the natural growth of
                    the population were the cholera of 1866-67, and the small-pox of 1870,—the
                    latter having actually occasioned an excess of 1178 deaths over the births for
                    the year. To this must be added the removal of the Government arsenal to Spezia
                    in 1870-1, and the tendency, which has gradually made itself felt since the
                    opening of the railways, to settle in the suburban towns. The stretch of coast
                    for miles along the gulf is an almost continuous line of country houses and
                    mansions, and indeed, to quote the words of Μ. Reclus, the whole riviera from
                    Ventimiglia to Spezia assumes more and more the aspect of a single town where
                    the populous quarters alternate with groups of villas and gardens. Proceeding
                    westwards we are no sooner beyond the fortifications than we find ourselves in
                    the flourishing town of Sampierdarena, that is, San Pier d’Arena, or St Peter of
                    the Sands. Down to the middle of last century it was mainly inhabited by the
                    wealthier classes, but has since become the seat of great industrial and
                    commercial activity. Its population, which in 1814 was only 5345, was upwards of
                    17,000 in 1877. From Sampierdarena a stone bridge of the 16th century, memorable
                    as the spot when Masséna signed the capitulation of Genoa, leads across the
                    Polcevera to Corneliano, a market-town with 2698 inhabitants at the census of
                    1871; and Corneliano in its turn connects itself with Sestri Ponente, a busy
                    place of from 9000 to 10,000 inhabitants, with a large shipbuilding trade.
                    Towards the cast there is a similar succession of villages and towns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early importance, both political and
                    commercial, of Genoa is attested by the part which it played in the Second Punic
                    War. Its supremacy amongst the neighbouring municipalities and populations is
                    not less evident from the inscription on the bronze table still to be seen in
                    the council-hall of the city. Its history during the dark ages, throughout the
                    Lombard and Carolingian periods, is but the repetition of the general history of
                    the Italian communes, which succeeded in snatching from contending princes and
                    barons the first charters of their freedom. The patriotic spirit and naval
                    prowess of the Genoese, developed in their defensive Avars against the
                    Saracens,· led to the foundation of a popular constitution, and to the rapid
                    growth of a powerful marine. From the necessity of leaguing together against the
                    common Saracen foe, Genoa united with Pisa in expelling the Moslems from the
                    island of Sardinia; but the Sardinian territory thus acquired soon furnished
                    occasions of jealousy to the conquering allies, and there commenced between the
                    two republics the long naval wars destined to terminate so fatally for Pisa.
                    With not less adroitness than Venice, Genoa saw and secured all the advantages
                    of the great carrying trade which the crusades created between Western Europe
                    and the East. The seaports wrested at the same period from the Saracens along
                    the Spanish and Barbary coasts became important Genoese colonies, whilst in the
                    Levant, on the shores of the Black Sea, and along the banks of the Euphrates
                    were erected Genoese fortresses, of which the strength some 40 years ago
                    commanded the admiration of the young traveller Moltke. No wonder if these
                    conquests generated in the minds of the Venetians and the Pisans fresh jealousy
                    against Genoa, and provoked fresh wars; but the struggle between Genoa and Pisa
                    was brought to a disastrous conclusion for the latter state by the battle of
                    Meloria. The commercial and naval successes of the Genoese during the Middle
                    Ages were the more remarkable because, unlike their rivals, the Venetians, they
                    were the unceasing prey to intestine discord—the Genoese commons and nobles
                    fighting against each other, rival factions amongst the nobles themselves
                    striving to grasp the supreme power in the state, nobles and commons alike
                    invoking the arbitration and rule of some foreign captain as the sole means of
                    obtaining a temporary truce. From these contests of rival nobles, in which the
                    names of Spinola and Doria stand forth with greatest prominence, Genoa was soon
                    drawn into the great vortex of the Guelph and Ghibelline factions; but its
                    recognition of foreign authority—successively German, Neapolitan, and
                    Milanese—gave way to a state of greater independence in 1339, when the
                    government assumed a more permanent form with the appointment of the first doge,
                    an office held at Genoa for life, in the person of Simon Boccanera. Alternate
                    victories and defeats of the Venetians and Genoese—the most terrible being the
                    defeat sustained by the Venetians at Chioggia in 1380—ended by establishing the
                    great relative inferiority of the Genoese rulers, who fell under the power now
                    of France, now of the Visconti of Milan, until the national spirit appeared to

                    of the 15th and commencement of the 16th century, that the genius and daring of
                    a Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, gave to Spain that new world, which
                    might have become the possession of his native state, had Genoa been able to
                    supply him with the ships and seamen which he so earnestly entreated her to
                    furnish. The government as restored by Andrea Doria, with certain modifications
                    tending to impart to it a more conservative character, remained unchanged until
                    the outbreak of the French Revolution and the creation of the Ligurian republic.
                    During this long period of nearly three centuries, in which the most dramatic
                    incident is the conspiracy of Fieschi, the Genoese found no small compensation
                    for their lost traffic in the East in the vast profits which they made as the
                    bankers of the Spanish crown and outfitters of the Spanish armies and fleets
                    both in the Old World and the New.</p>
                <p>The short-lived Ligurian republic was soon swallowed up in the French empire,
                    not, however, until Genoa had been made to experience, by the terrible
                    privations of the siege when Masséna held the city against the Austrians (1800),
                    all that was meant by a participation in the vicissitudes of the French
                    Revolution. In 1814 Genoa rose against the French, on the assurance given by
                    Lord William Bentinck that the allies would restore to the republic its
                    independence. It had, however, been determined by a secret clause of the treaty
                    of Paris that Genoa should be incorporated with the dominions of the king of
                    Sardinia. The discontent created at the time by the provision of the treaty of
                    Paris as confirmed by the congress of Vienna had doubtless no slight share in
                    keeping alive in Genoa the republican spirit which, through the influence of a
                    young Genoese citizen, Joseph Mazzini, assumed forms of permanent menace not
                    only to the Sardinian monarchy but to all the established Governments of the
                    peninsula. Even the material benefits accruing from the union with Sardinia and
                    the constitutional liberty accorded to all his subjects by King Charles Albert
                    were unable to prevent the republican outbreak of 1850, when, after a short and
                    sharp struggle the city, momentarily seized by the republican party, was
                    recovered by General Alfonzo La Marmora. The most important of the later events
                    in the history of Genoa has been the seizure within its port of the five
                    Neapolitan brigands, Cipriano La Gala and his accomplices, who travelling with
                    papal passports were arrested on board the French passenger steamer, the
                    “Aunis,” by orders of the Marquis Gualterio prefect of Genoa. Though the event
                    threatened at first to create a rupture between the French and Italian
                    Governments, the diplomatic discussions which it called forth, and the
                    impression generally produced throughout Europe, had no slight share in
                    weakening the political ties which had hitherto existed between the Papal
                    Government and· France.</p>
                <p>Among the earlier Genoese historians the most important are Bartolommeo Fazio and
                    Jacopo Bracelli, both of the 15th century, and Paolo Partenopeo, Jacopo
                    Bonfadio, Oberto Foglietta, and Agostino Giustiniano of the 16th. Paganetti
                    wrote the ecclesiastical history of the city; and Accinelli and Gaggero
                    collected material for the ecclesiastical archaeology. The memoirs of local
                    writers and artists were treated by Soprani and Ratti. Among more general works
                    are Brêquigny, Histoire des Revolutions de Gênes jusqu'en 1748; Serra, La Storia

                    1844-54), Xuova istoria della repubblica di Genova (Florence, 1853), and Storia

                    iurium reipublicoe Genuensis was edited by Ricotti in the 7th, 8th, and 9th
                    volumes of the Monumenta historiae patriot (Turin, 1854-1857). A great variety
                    of interesting matter will be found in the Atti della Società Ligure di Storia
                    patria (13 volumes, from 1861-1878), and in the Giornale Ligustico di
                    Archeologia, Storia, e Bell’ Arti. The history of the university has been
                    written by Lorenzo Isnardi, and continued by Em. Celesia (2 vols., Genoa).
