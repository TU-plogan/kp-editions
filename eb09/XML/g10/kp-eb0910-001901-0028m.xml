                    the theory that Paul when he uses the word Galatia intends the Roman province,
                    and that by the Galatians we are to understand chiefly the Christians of
                    Antioch, Iconium, Derbe, and Lystra. Their arguments are drawn from the ordinary
                    <hi rend="italic">usus</hi><hi rend="italic">loquendi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> Paul (by Asia, Macedonia, Achaia he invariably means the provinces
                    bearing these names); from the analogy of 1 Pet. i. 1, where all the districts
                    mentioned happen to be “provinces”; from such considerations as the
                    inaccessibility of Galatia proper; from inferences based on Acts xviii. 23, Gal.
                    ii. 5, and other texts; and from the admittedly perplexing fact that unless the
                    churches of Derbe, Lystra, &amp;c., be regarded as Galatian, we are left in
                    ignorance of the names, localities, and histories of the churches addressed.
                    But, as has been seen, the ancient <hi rend="italic">usus loquendi</hi> appears
                    on the whole to have disregarded the Roman division of provinces in this case at
                    least; moreover, Iconium was never a part of the Roman Galatia; and in any case
                    there would have been an inappropriateness in addressing Lycaonians and
                    Pisidians by a title so rich in ethnological and historical suggestion as that
                    of “Galatians” is.</p></note> On this assumption, the history of the formation
                    of the Christian “churches of Galatia” is very obscure. It is obvious enough,
                    from the epistle itself, that they had been planted by Paul · but when, or under
                    what circumstances, we are nowhere explicitly informed. In the Acts of the
                    Apostles we read that, accompanied by Silas, he set out on what is generally
                    known as his second missionary journey soon after the council of Jerusalem,
                    which may be dated approximately as having occurred about the year 52 <hi

                    After having traversed “Syria” and “Cilicia,” strengthening the churches, they
                    “passed through Phrygia and the region of Galatia <hi rend="italic">(την</hi><hi

                    not.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So Acts xvi. 6, 7,

                    The language here employed, even if, as Wieseler argues, it implies that
                    preaching was engaged in, can hardly be said to suggest of itself that churches
                    had been formed on the route, but rather appears to hint at a forced and rapid
                    march. Acts xviii. 23, however, indicates that “disciples” at least had been
                    made, and it is well known that in the narrative of the Act3 many important
                    passages in the eventful public life of the apostle have been passed with even
                    less explicit allusion. Combining then the meagre facts which that narrative in
                    this instance affords with inferences derived from incidental expressions made
                    use of in the epistle itself, we conjecture the apostle to have been detained by
                    ill-health (see Gal. iv. 13, “because of bodily weakness”), probably in the
                    western district of Galatia (that of the Tolistobogii), though not at the
                    capital Pessinus itself, but nearer the borders of Asia and Mysia; and there, in

                    Galatians, although in their intercourse with one another they still continued
                    to make use of their ancient dialect, were quite able to understand the then

                    favour and even with enthusiasm (Gal. iv. 14). How loug this visit continued we
                    are not told; but most of the chronological evidence goes to show that it cannot
                    have lasted more than six months, and that it probably came to an end within a
                    much shorter interval. Resuming the journey by Mysia and the Troad, Paul and his
                    companion proceeded to “Macedonia” and “Achaia,” spending in the latter province
                    at least eighteen months, and finding no opportunity of revisiting Galatia for a
                    space of at least three years. During this interval several causes must have
                    been quietly but constantly working with a iendency to alienate the Galatian
                    converts from the new “gospel of the uncircumcision” (∈υαγγ∈λtov <hi
                    rend="italic">τηςακροβυστίας,</hi></p>
                <p>11. 7), and induce them to that conformity with certain parts of Jewish
                    ceremonial which was even at that time described by the word “Judaizing”
                    (ίουδαίξαν, Gal. ii. 14). Even among those whose leanings were towards the
                    spiritual religion of the Old Testament, Jewish habits of thinking and feeling
                    could never fail to assert themselves with considerable strength; and there were
                    also elements peculiar to the old pagan religion of the district which were
                    fitted to predispose even the heathen mind towards that ceremonialism and
                    “making a fair show in the flesh” <hi rend="italic">(eυπpoσωπησaι εv</hi><hi

                    themselves in the way of deliberate rebellion against the teachings which Paul
                    had left behind him, can only be a matter of pure conjecture; but it would
                    appear that,⅛ven if the revolt had been originated by Palestinian Jews, it had
                    at least been fomented by other agitators who were Gentiles by birth (v. 12; vi.
                    13); nor does it seem improbable that they had begun their work very soon after
                    the time of the apostle’s first visit. The second visit, mentioned in Acts
                    xviii. 23, which must have taken place about 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    and have occupied very little time, appears to have been on the whole a pleasant
                    one; the apostle was still received with due respect (iv.</p>
                <p>12, 18), and may well have left Galatia with the impression that the disciples
                    had been “strengthened” by him, and that they “were running well ’’ (v. 7). But
                    shortly after his departure tidings reached him that, though the influence of
                    the Judaizers had for the time been neutralized by iis presence, it had begun to
                    reassert itself with greater force than ever almost immediately after he had
                    gone, and that his disciples had been so “bewitched” that, after “having begun
                    in the spirit,” they were now endeavouring to be “made perfect by the flesh.” He
                    also learned that the reactionary doctrines had been supported by a suggestion
                    that he himself was no teacher of independent authority, but merely a
                    subordinate, and that a treacherous one, of the original apostles and pillars of
                    the church, whose “gospel” was emphatically “of the circumcision.” Immediately
                    on receipt of this intelligence, he wrote the present epistle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contents.</hi> —It consists of three parts, in which the

                    (1.) After an expression of surprise at the instability displayed by his
                    Galatian converts, the author proceeds to establish the divineness of his
                    message by an historical proof of the wholly divine character of his commission
                    to be its messenger. He urges that he had received his apostleship directly from
                    God; and that, far from proceeding from men, it had been tardily, and so far
                    reluctantly, acknowledged by them only after it had become an altogether patent
                    and undeniable fact. His first visit to Jerusalem had been three years after his
                    conversion. If it had not resulted in his recognition as on a footing of
                    equality with the apostles, it at least had not led to his taking any position
                    of subordination; while on his second visit to Jerusalem he had met the apostles
                    and deliberated with them on terms of undisputed parity. On the third occasion
                    of his coming into contact with an apostolic person so distinguished as Peter,
                    he had openly withstood him and vanquished him in argument, thereby even
                    establishing a superiority. (2.) He proceeds to state and defend the doctrine of
                    justification by faith in the crucified Christ. After alluding to it as a truth
                    already established in their Christian consciousness (iii. 1-5), he proceeds to
                    show that the same truth had been embedded in the whole Old Testament
                    revelation, and was capable of being deduced from the entire course of the past
                    history of the church. The religion of Abraham had been a religion of faith, and
                    his justification had not been a justification by works (iii. 6-18). The law
                    which came later is misunderstood if it be regarded as superseding the promise
                    which had been the foundation of the religion of the patriarch. Its relation to
                    the promise was manifestly of a subordinate and temporary kind. To regard it as
                    having been otherwise would be as absurd as to suppose that a Hagar and an
                    Ishmael could ever have taken that place in the family which belonged of
                    inalienable right to Sarah and to Isaac (iii. 19—iv. 31). (3.) He exhorts to a
                    continuance in the life of faith which is also the life of freedom, and warns
                    against any relapse under the yoke of Judaism (v. 1-12). He explains that
                    Christian freedom is a freedom conditioned by morality (v. 13—vi. 10), and
                    concludes with a recapitulation and the benediction.</p>

                    epistle has never been disputed. The external evidence is remarkably clear and

                    may refer only to vi. 11-18. The question as to its date has given occasion for
                    considerable diversity of opinion. It has been seen that the apostle wrote
                    immediately after he had heard of the change that had come over the Galatian
                    churches, and that this change occurred “soon” <hi rend="italic">(ταχέως)</hi>
                    after his second visit. These facts favour a date not much later than 55 A.D.
                    Further, a comparison of the epistle to the Galatians with those to the Romans
                    and Corinthians results, on the whole, in favour of the opinion that it was the
                    earliest of the four, or at all events not much later than the latest, in other
                    words, not later than 59 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It is probably idle to

                    critics, according to the interpretation adopted, in placing it either early in
                    the Ephesian sojourn or late in the Corinthian. The majority of the moderns is

                    made to the theory of Renan and Hausrath, which leads them to assign this
                    epistle to the period of the second missionary journey. Apart from the
                    considerations which have been indicated in a preceding note, this view is open
                    to the objection that it raises new and gratuitous difficulties in connexion
                    with the history and chronology of the Acts; it has accordingly niet with
                    comparatively little acceptance. According to some older writers, such as
                    Michaelis, Koppe, Borger, the supposed absence of any reference to the council
                    of Jerusalem implies a very early date; English readers, on the other hand, are
                    familiar with the statement derived from some of the later Greek MSS., and
                    supported by the Syriac and Arabic versions, as well as by the weighty authority
                    of Eusebius, Jerome, and Theodoret, that the epistle was “written from Rome.”
                    This view has been advocated in modern times also by C. Schrader; but the
                    general verdict vzill .probably continue to be, as it has for some time been,

                    Galatians,</hi> 1865, 2d ed. 1874). Those belonging to the Reformation period
                    are sufficiently well known, particularly Luther’s, Calvin’s, and Beza’s. Of
                    modem English commentaries the most exhaustive is that of Dr Lightfoot, already
                    referred to; but those of Ellicott (1854), JoWett (1855), and Alford (1857) are
                    also of great value. In Germany one of the latest is that of Wieseler <hi

                    of the epistle is to be derived from the various works on the apostle Paul and
