                    Science, however, offered to him a career more congenial to his tastes than that
                    of an ecclesiastic, and, after some persuasion, he gained from his father
                    permission to remain in Paris, and to attend the lectures at the Collège de
                    France and the Jardin des Plantes, on the condition that he should likewise read
                    law. He accordingly took up his residence at Cardinal Lemoine’s college, and
                    there became the pupil and soon the esteemed associate of Brisson’s friend,
                    Haüy, the eminent mineralogist, under whose guiding influence his passion for
                    the natural sciences daily deepened. Having, before the close of the year 1790,
                    taken the degree of bachelor in law, he became a student of medicine, but the
                    lectures of Fourcroy at the Jardin des Plantes, and of Daubenton at the Collège
                    de France, and his favourite scientific pursuits gradually came to occupy his
                    almost exclusive attention. His studies at Paris were at length suddenly
                    interrupted, for, on the 12th or 13th of August 1792, Haüy and the other
                    professors of Lemoine’s college, as also those of the college of Navarre, were
                    arrested by the revolutionists as priests, and confined in the prison of St
                    Firmin. Through Daubenton and other persons of distinction with whom he was
                    acquainted, Geoffroy on the 14th August obtained an order for the release of
                    Haüy in the name of the Academy; still the other professors of the two colleges,
                    save Lhomond, who had been rescued by his pupil Tallien, remained in
                    confinement. Geoffroy, foreseeing their certain destruction <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0185-0174"/> if they remained in the hands of the
                    revolutionists, determined if possible to secure their liberty by stratagem. By
                    bribing one of the officials at St Firmin, and disguising himself as a
                    commissioner of prisons, he gained admission to his friends, and entreated them
                    to effect their escape by following him. All, however, dreading lest their
                    deliverance should render the doom of their fellow-captives the more certain,
                    refused the offer, and one priest only, who was unknown to Geoffroy, left the
                    prison. Already on the night of the 2d of September the massacre of the
                    proscribed had begun, when Geoffroy, yet intent on saving the life of his
                    friends and teachers, repaired to St Firmin. At 4 o’clock on the morning of the
                    3d Sept., after 8 hours’ waiting, he by means of a ladder assisted the escape of
                    twelve ecclesiastics, not of the number of his acquaintance, and then the
                    approach of dawn and the discharge of a gun directed at him warned him, his
                    chief purpose unaccomplished, to return to his lodgings. Leaving Paris he
                    retired to Étampes, where, in consequence of the anxieties of which he had
                    lately been the prey, and the horrors which he had witnessed, he was for some
                    time seriously ill. At the beginning of the winter of 1792 he returned to hi≡
                    studies in Paris, and in March of the following year Daubenton, through the
                    interest of Bernardin de Saint Pierre, procured him the office of sub-keeper and
                    assistant demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history, vacant by the
                    resignation of Lacépède. By a law passed June 10th, 1793, Geoffroy was appointed
                    one of the twelve professors of the newly constituted museum of natural history,
                    being assigned the chair of zoology. In the same year he busied himself with the
                    formation of a menagerie at that institution. On the 6th May 1794 commenced his
                    opening course of lectures, and on December 1st he read to the society of
                    natural history his first paper, on the subject of the Aye-aye. It was in 1794,
                    also, that through the introduction of Tessier he entered into correspondence
                    with Georges Cuvier, to whom, after the perusal of some of his manuscripts, he
                    wrote: “Venez jouer parmi nous le rôle de Linné, d’un autre législateur de
                    l’histoire naturelle.” Shortly after the appointment of Cuvier as Mertrud’s
                    assistant (see vol. vi. p. 740), Geoffroy received him into his house. The two
                    friends wrote together five memoirs on natural history, one of which, on the
                    classification of mammals, puts forward the idea of the subordination of
                    characters upon which Cuvier based his zoological system. It was in a paper
                    entitled “Histoire des Makis, ou singes de Madagascar,” written in 1795, that
                    Geoffroy first gave expression to his views on “the unity of organic
                    composition,” the influence of which is perceptible in all his subsequent
                    writings: nature, he observes, presents us with only one plan of construction,
                    the same in principle, but varied in its accessory parts.</p>
                <p>In 1798 Geoffroy was chosçn a member of the great scientific expedition to Egypt.
                    With Delile and Larrey, on the capitulation of Alexandria in August 1801, he
                    resisted the claim made by the British general Hutchinson to the collections of
                    the expedition, sending him word that, were his demand persisted in, history
                    would have to record of him that he also had burnt a library in Alexandria.
                    Early in January 1802 Geoffroy returned to his accustomed labours in Paris. He
                    was elected a member of the academy of sciences of that city in September 1807.
                    In March of the following year the emperor, who had already recognized his
                    national services by the award of the cross of the legion of honour, selected
                    him to visit the museums of Portugal, for the purpose of procuring from them
                    collections, and these, though in the face of considerable opposition from the
                    British, he eventually was successful in retaining as a permanent possession for
                    his country. In 1809, the year after his return to France, he was made professor
                    of zoology of the faculty of sciences at Paris, and from that -period he devoted
                    himself more exclusively than before to the study of anatomical philosophy. In
                    1815 he was elected political representative for his native town. Three years
                    later he gave to the world the first part of his celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophie Anatomique,</hi> the second volume of which, published in 1822, and
                    memoirs subsequently written account for the formation of monstrosities on the
                    principle of arrest of development, and of the attraction of similar parts.
                    When, in 1830, Geoffroy proceeded to apply to the in vertebra ta his views as to
                    the unity of animal composition, he found a vigorous opponent in Georges Cuvier,
                    and the discussion between them, continued up to the time of the death of the
                    latter, soon attracted the attention of the scientific throughout Europe.
                    Geoffroy, a synthesist, contended, in accordance with his theory of unity of
                    plan in organic composition, that all animals are formed of the same elements,
                    in the same number, and with the same connexions: homologous parts, however they
                    differ in form and size, must remain associated in the same invariable order.
                    With Goethe he held that there is in nature a law of compensation or balancing
                    of growth, so that if one organ take on an excess of development, it is at the
                    expense of some other part <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Darwin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origin of Species,</hi> 5th ed., p. 182); and he maintained that, since nature
                    takes no sudden leaps, even organs which are superfluous in any given species,
                    if they have played an important part in other species of the same family, are
                    retained as rudiments, which testify to the permanence of the general plan of
                    creation. It was his conviction that, owing to the conditions of life, the same
                    forms had not been perpetuated since the origin of all things, although it was
                    not his belief that existing species are becoming modified (see Darwin, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. xvi.). Cuvier, who was an analytical observer of
                    facts, admitted only the prevalence of “laws of coexistence” or “harmony” in
                    animal organs, and maintained the absolute invariability of species, which he
                    declared had been created with a regard to the circumstances in which they were
                    placed, each organ contrived with a view to the function it [had to fulfil, thus
                    putting, in Geoffroy’s consideration, the effect for the cause. In July 1840
                    Geoffroy became blind, and some months later he had a paralytic attack. From
                    that time his strength gradually failed him. He resigned his chair at the museum
                    in 1841, and on the 19th June 1844, at the age of 72, he died.</p>
