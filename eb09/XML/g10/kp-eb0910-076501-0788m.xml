                    enactment of James VI. (tlιen James I. of England), bearing date 1618, we find
                    that a considerable importation of golf balls at that time took place from
                    Holland, and as thereby “na small quantifie of gold and silver is transported
                    zierly out of his Hienes’ kingdome of Scoteland” (see letter of his Majesty from
                    Salisbury, 5th Aug. 1618), he issues a royal prohibition, at once as a wise
                    economy of the national monies, and a protection to native industry in the
                    article. From this it might almost seem that the game was at that date still
                    known and practised in Holland, though it has long since entirely disappeared
                    there.</p></note></p>
                <p>Golf maybe practised on anygood stretch of meadow-land, where the grass is not
                    too rank; but the ground best suited for the purpose is a reach of undulating
                    down-country, such as is common on the seaboard,—sandy in soil, and as such
                    covered with a short crisp turf, occasionally broken up by sandholes or
                    “bunkers,” and provided, in addition, with a fair supply of gorse or whin. These
                    “bunkers” and whins constitute the main “hazards” of the game, in the avoidance
                    of which skill in it is specially shown; and without a fair provision of them,
                    no golfing “links” or “green” can be held to approach the ideal standard. Small
                    holes, of about 4 inches diameter, are punched in the turf at distances
                    indefinitely variable, but ranging from about 100 to 400 or 500 yards; and from
                    one of these holes into the next in order, a ball of gutta percha of about If
                    oz. weight has to be driven with implements (clubs) of some variety, devised for
                    the purpose. Their variety is determined by this, that while, in starting from
                    the hole, the ball may be <hi rend="italic">teed {i.e.,</hi> placed where the
                    player chooses, with a little pinch of sand under it called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tee),</hi> it must in every other case be played strictly from its place as it
                    chances to lie,—in sand, whin, or elsewhere,—a different club being necessary in
                    each particular difficulty. These clubs may generally be defined as shafts of
                    wood, with so called <hi rend="italic">heads</hi> of wood or iron attached.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A complete set of them may
                    number about a dozen :—a driving club, a long, a middle, and a short ‘‘ spoon”
                    (so called from the face of the club being spooned, or bevelled, to lift a
                    bad-lying ball), and a “putter” (the use of which is explained below) are the
                    clubs formed wholly of wood, while of iron there are—a heavy and a light “iron,”
                    a driving and a lifting “cleek,” possibly also a “putting cleek, finally a‘
                    niblick,” constructed to pick a ball out of some such hole as no other iron can
                    reach.</p></note> Starting from the one hole, it is the immediate aim of the
                    player to drive his ball as far towards the next as he can. Having got within
                    some moderate distance of it, he proceeds to make his “approach shot,” carefully
                    selecting the appropriate implement. When he has reached the “putting green,”—a
                    smooth space carefully chosen for the purpose,·—he essays to put (or putt) his
                    ball into the hole; and generally, if he does it in two strokes, he may be held
                    skilful or fortunate. The player who holes his ball in the smallest number of
                    strokes is, as matter of course, winner of the hole. The “approach” and the
                    “putting” are by far the most difficult, critical, and important parts of the
                    game; though no one who is not fairly competent in his driving also is ever in
                    the least likely to take rank as a first-class player. The maximum length of a
                    good driving stroke for a first-class player, not favoured by any exceptional
                    circumstances, may perhaps fairly be stated as something over 180 yards, and
                    under 200. For further details as to the mode and order of playing, the reader
                    is referred to the set of “rules” appended to this article.</p>
                <p>The game, in description as above, may not seem very lively or entertaining; and
                    it is to be admitted that, seen for the first time, more especially if played by
                    bungling or indifferent performers, it does not look of much promise. No game,
                    however, stirs a keener enthusiasm in its votaries; and very few people who have
                    ever fairly committed themselves to serious practice of it will be found to deny
                    its extreme fascination. It is a manly and eminently healthful recreation,
                    pursued as it is mostly amid the fresh seabreezes; while, as exercise, it has
                    this peculiar merit, that, according to pace, it may be made easy or smart at
                    pleasure, and thus equally adapts itself to the overflowing exuberance of youth,
                    the matured and tempered strength of manhood, and the gentler decays of age.</p>
                <p>It is uncertain at what date golf was introduced into Scotland, but in 1457 the
                    popularity of the game had already become so great as seriously to interfere
                    with the more important pursuit of archery, and cause the rulers of the realm to
                    sound a note of alarm. In March of that year, it is recorded that the Scottish
                    parliament “deereted and ordained that wapinshawingis be halden be the lordis
                    and baronis spirituale and temporale, four times in the zeir; and that the
                    fute-ball and <hi rend="italic">golf be utterly cryit down, and nocht usit;</hi>
                    and that the bowe-merkis be maid at ilk paroche kirk a pair of buttis, and <hi
                    rend="italic">sehuttin be usit ilk Sunday.”</hi> It does not appear, however,
                    that to this patriotic decree of their parliament the people paid much
                    attention; and fourteen years afterwards, in May 1471, it was judged necessary
                    to pass another Act “anent wapenshawings,” and for opposing “our auld enimies of
                    England.” But it seems to have been pretty much as before; <hi rend="italic"
                    >sehuttin</hi> was no more <hi rend="italic">usit,</hi> nor golf the less
                    steadily played because of these decrees of parliament; and accordingly in 1491
                    a final and evidently angry fulmination is issued on the general subject, with
                    pains and penalties annexed. It runs thus—“Futeball and Golfe forbidden. Item,
                    it is statut and ordainit that in na place of the realme there be usit futeball,
                    <hi rend="italic">golfe,</hi><hi rend="italic">or uther sik

                    foresaid,” &amp;c. This, be it noted, is an edict of James IV.; and it is not a
                    little curious presently to find the monarch himself breaking his own behest,
                    and setting an ill example to his commons, by practice of this “unprofitabill
                    sport,” as is shown by various entries in the accounts of the Lord High
                    Treasurer of Scotland (1503-6).</p>
                <p>About a century later, the game again appears on the surface of history, and it
                    is quite as popular as before. In the year 1592, the Town Council of Edinburgh

                <p>Golf has from old times been known in Scotland as “The <hi rend="italic">Royal
                    and Ancient</hi> Game of Goff.” Though no doubt Scottish monarchs handled the
                    club before him, James IV. is the first who figures formally in the golfing
                    record. James V. was also very partial to the game distinctively known as
                    “royal”; and there is some scrap of evidence to show that his daughter, the
                    unhappy Mary Stuart, was, in some sort of feminine way, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >golfer.</hi> It was alleged by her enemies that, as showing her shameless
                    indifference to the fate of her husband, a very few days after his murder, she
                    “was seen playing <hi rend="italic">golf</hi> and pallmall in the fields beside
                    Seton.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    golfer tradition confidently asserts, though the evidence which connects him
                    with the personal practice of the game is slight. Of the interest he took in it
                    we have evidence in his Act—already alluded to—“anent <hi rend="italic"
                    >golfe</hi><hi rend="italic">ballis,”</hi> prohibiting their importation, except
                    under certain restrictions. Charles I. (as his brother Prince Henry had

                    Whilst engaged in it on the links of Leith, in 1642, the news reached him of the
                    Irish rebellion of that year. He had not the equanimity to finish his match, but
                    returned precipitately and in much agitation to Holyrood.<note anchored="true"

                    commissioner of the king to parliament, and an historical monument of his
                    prowess as a golfer remains there to this day in tbe “Golfer’s Land,” as it is
                    still called, 77 Canongate. The duke having been challenged by two English
                    noblemen of his suite, or <hi rend="italic">entourage,</hi> to play a match
                    against them, for a very large stake, along with any Scotch ally he might
                    select, judiciously chose as his partner one “Johne Patersone,” a shoemaker—a
                    local <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> of the day, it is to be presumed. The duke
                    and the said Johne won easily, and half of the large stake the duke made over to
                    his humble coadjutor, who therewith built himself the house mentioned above.
                    With the Revolution royal patronage entirely ceased, to be renewed only in
                    comparatively recent times. In 1834 William IV. became patron of^e St Andrews
                    Golf Club (St Andrews, the ancient ecclesiastical ιn∙Wopolisσf Scotland, being
                    now, as of old, the most famous seat of the game), and to approve of its being
                    styled in time coming “The <hi rend="italic">Royal and Ancient</hi> Golf Club of
                    St Andrews.” In 1837, as further proof of royal favour, he presented to it a
                    magnificent gold medal, which “should be challenged and played for annually;”
                    and in 1838 the queen dowager, duchess of St Andrews, became patroness of the
                    club, and presented to it a handsome gold medal— “The Royal Adelaide,”—as a mark
                    of her approbation, with a request that it should be worn by the captain, as
                    president, on all public occasions. In June 1863 the prince of Wales signified
                    his desire to become patron of the club, and in the following September was
                    elected captain by acclamation. The engagements of the prince did not admit of
                    his coming in person to undertake the duties of the office, but his brother
                    Prince Leopold, having in 1876 done the club the honour to become its captain,
                    twice visited the ancient city in that capacity. Prince Leopold is himself a
                    keen player, and under his superintendence a green has been laid out in
                    Windsor-park. The ancient game of golf has thus fairly now again become as
                    “royal” as ever it was in its old historic periods.</p>
                <p>The later fortunes of the game have been uneventful. While always keeping its
                    hold on the affections of the people, it might readily be shown, that over
                    Scotland generally its tide, till nearly within our o∖yn time, was rather an
                    ebbing than a flowing one. While it remained a favourite pastime with some of
                    the aristocracy and gentry who always had a sufficient following where—as
                    instance, in Edinburgh—the due facilities admitted, the general enthusiasm for
                    the sport which lives for us in the old records had certainly disappeared, and
                    over various isolated greens, where playing was at one time constant, it had
                    virtually and sometimes absolutely died out. Its increased popularity within
                    recent years has no doubt been largely due to those general causes which have
                    led to a keener interest in almost every form of out-door amusement, but it is
                    also in some measure to be attributed to greatly extended railway facilities,
                    and to the introduction some thirty years ago of the cheap and durable gutta
                    percha ball to replace the old missile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p> The old ball was, roughly, a circlet of leather, stitched
                    together in sections, and stuffed as hard as a stone with feathers. It was about
                    twice the price of the present ball, and almost incomparably less
                    durable.</p></note></p>
                <p>It remains to give some little account of the more noted golf clubs and golfing
                    grounds. The most famous of golf clubs, to which primacy is by common consent
                    accorded, is' that of the city of St Andrews, instituted in 1754. F or various
                    reasons this club has always been of much more than merely local celebrity. Its
                    membership is far more numerous than that of any other; nearly all golfers of
                    note belong to it; and to its spring and autumn meetings they flock from every
                    part of the kingdom. To be winner of a medal at St Andrews is thus the highest
                    honour to which the ambition of the golfer can aspire. A “round,” as it is
                    termed, of the links is very nearly four miles; and, extent and quality
                    considered, the green is on the whole unrivalled by any other in Scotland. Of
                    greens in Fife of minor importance, those of Elie and Leven may be noted. Next
                    in importance to “The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews’’ ranks “The
                    Honourable the Edinburgh Company of Golfers,” who play over Musselburgh green,
                    one of fair but scarcely supreme quality. The first of its regular series of
                    minutes bears date 1744, and is signed by Lord President Duncan Forbes of
                    Culloden, but the club itself is beyond question very much older. Of other
                    Edinburgh golf clubs maybe noted “The Bruntsfield,” founded in the year
                    1760,-and the “Edinburgh Burgess,” the minute books of which are preserved since
                    the year 1773, though it claims to have date of origin 1735. In East Lothian,
                    besides the good old green of North Berwick, there are of late years two
                    others,—Gullane and Luffness,—and on all three excellent golfing sport is to be
                    had, At the ancient city of Perth, though the ground is but indifferently
                    adapted for it, the old Scottish game has continuously been maintained, and
                    still flourishes. So also in Forfarshire, at the historic green of Montrose, to
                    which in our own time have been added those of Monifeith and Carnoustie, which,
                    from their proximity to Dundee, naturally attract many players; and all three
                    may be ranked as greens of fair quality. At Aberdeen, till very lately, the game
                    had quite died out, but it has now been with more or less of vigour resumed. At
                    Stirling likewise it was extinct, but is now again fairly alive, though under
                    conditions of ground, as at Perth, not quite satisfactory. At Glasgow also,
                    where on the old “Glasgow Green” the game was habitually played, it had lapsed
                    into disuse and even oblivion; but within the last ten years the general
                    resuscitation has reached it, and a spirited club now exists there. If the
                    ground is by no means what might be wished, the Glasgow golfer, by a very easy
                    railway run, can reach the green of Prestwick, near Ayr. The “Prestwick Club”
                    is, by comparison, of recent origin, having been organized mainly by the last
                    earl of Eglintoun, and one or two gentlemen in the neighbourhood, interested
                    like himself in the game. Except for limitation in extent, making it impossible
                    that a large “field” should be accommodated without confusion and even danger,
                    such is the excellence of the ground that, as a “sporting” green, to test play,
                    that of Prestwick is held by competent judges perhaps to surpass all others. A
                    second links has receutly been opened at Prestwick, and another at Troon, on the
                    same coast.</p>
                <p>The oldest golf club in the kingdom is not improbably that of Blackheath, near
                    London. The old records of the club were unfortunately destroyed by fire at
                    Greenwich, where they were kept, and 1766 is thus the earliest date for which
                    there is documentary evidence. Tradition places the origin of this club so far
                    back as 1608, when King James, with his Scotch following, brought the game south
                    into England. Recently another London club has been started, whose ground of
                    play is at Wimbledon. Neither green is of great merit, but both are much prized
                    and frequented by golfers in and near London. In 1864, at Bideford, in
                    Devonshire, a golfing green was laid out by the well-known Tom Morris of St
                    Andrews, and a club was duly instituted, which has since continued to flourish.
                    This links is one of the finest and most extensive anywhere to be found, and
                    despite the disadvantage of remoteness and difficulty of access, the meetings of
                    the club attract players from all quarters, and are commonly most successful.
                    More lately an excellent green was opened at Hoylake, near Liverpool, and the
                    club here has also prospered greatly. At Crookham in Berkshire, and Alnwick in
                    Northumberland, the game is regularly played; and at the universities of Oxford
                    and Cambridge rival golf clubs have within the last few years been formed. In
                    brief, the game has now thoroughly taken root in England; from year to year it
                    is rapidly spreading, and many fine English players have already passed into the
                    front rank.</p>
                <p>In nearly all the British colonies the game has naturalized itself. Golf clubs of
                    old standing exist at Calcutta and Bombay, and more casually over India a good
                    deal of play is to be met with. Wherever Scots congregate in any numbers a golf
                    club is pretty sure to spring up. In Canada and the United States, as in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0790-0767"/> Australia and New Zealand, many clubs may be
                    found flourishing; and, oddly enough, at Pau in the Pyrenees, a golf club has
                    long existed. An export of clubs and balls to all these golfing dependencies has
                    long formed, and still forms, an important item of the manufacture.</p>
                <p>We must not quit the subject without making note of one pleasing innovation. Some
                    six or eight years ago, the ladies took to the game, and since have diligently
                    prosecuted it in large numbers, some attaining no mean proficiency. They have
                    hitherto confined themselves to the “short game,” as it is termed, or putting;
                    and where a separate piece of ground has been assigned them, as at St Andrews,
                    North Berwick, and elsewhere, the “Ladies’ Links” form a pretty and charming
                    adjunct to the main green.</p>
                <p>We append the more important rules of the game, as played by “The Royal and
                    Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews,” which, though .it has no claim to give law to
                    other clubs, may be accepted as, on the whole, the best authority on the subject
                    :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Mode and Order of Playing the Game.—</hi> The game of golf
                    is played by two persons, or by four (two of aside), playing alternately. It may
                    also be played by three or more persons, each playing his own ball. The game
                    commences by each party playing off a ball from a place called the <hi
                    rend="italic">tee,</hi> near the first hole. In a match of four, those who are
                    opposed to each other, and to play off, shall be named at starting, and shall
                    continue so during the match. The person entitled to play off first shall be
                    named by the parties themselves; and although the courtesy of starting is
                    generally granted to old captains of the club, or members, it may be settled by
                    lot or toss of a coin. The hole is won by the party holing at fewest strokes,
                    and the reckoning of the game is made by the terms <hi rend="italic">odds</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">like, one more, two more,</hi> &amp;c. The party gaining
                    the hole is to lead, unless his opponent has won the previous match, in which
                    case the latter leads off, and is entitled to claim his privilege, and to recall
                    his opponent’s stroke should he play out of order. One round of the links, or 18
                    holes, is reckoned a match, unless otherwise stipulated. If, in a double match,
                    one person shall play twice in succession, he loses the hole.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Place of Teeing.—</hi> The ball must be teed not nearer the
                    hole than eight, nor further than twelve club lengths, except where special
                    ground has been marked by the conservator of the links, which shall be
                    considered the “teeing ground,” and the balls shall be teed within and not in
                    advance of such marks. After the balls arc struck off, the ball farthest from
                    the hole to which the parties are playing must be played first. When two parties
                    meet on the putting green, the party first there may claim the privilege of
                    holing out, and any party coming up must wait till the other party has played
                    out the hole, and on no account play their balls up lest they should annoy the
                    parties who are putting. No player may play his teed ball till the party in
                    front have played their second strokes,</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Changing the Balls.—</hi> The balls struck off from the
                    tee must not be changed, touched, or moved before the hole is played out (except
                    in striking, and the cases provided for by Rules VIIf., XVI II., and XIX.); and
                    if the parties are at a loss to know the one ball from the other, neither shall
                    be lifted till both parties agree.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Lifting of Break-Clubs,</hi> &amp;c.—All loose impediments
                    within a club length of the ball may be removed on or off the course, when the
                    ball lies on grass (see Rules VI. and XII.) When a ball lies in a bunker, sand,
                    or any other hazard, there shall be no impression made, nor sand or other
                    obstacle removed by the club, or otherwise, either on or off the green, before
                    striking at the ball. When a ball lies within a club length of a washing-tub,
                    the tub may be removed, and when on clothes the ball may be lifted and dropped
                    behind them.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Entitled to see the Ball.—</hi> When a ball is completely
                    covered with fog, bent, whins, &amp;c., ⅞o much thereof shall be set aside as
                    that the player shall merely have a view of his ball before he plays, whether in
                    a line with the hole or otherwise. A ball stuck fast in wet ground or sand may
                    be taken out and replaced loosely in the hole it has made.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Clearing the Putting Green.—</hi> All loose impediments, of
                    whatever kind, may be lifted on the putting green or table-land on which the
                    hole is placed (excepting as declared in Rule IV. ), which is considered not to
                    exceed twenty yards from the hole. Nothing can be lifted either on the course or
                    putting green, if it is to move the ball out of its position.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Lifting Balls.—</hi> When, on any part of the course, or
                    off it, or in a bunker, the balls lie within six inches of each other, the ball
                    nearest the hole must be lifted till the other is played, and then placed as
                    nearly as possible in its original position—the six inches to be measured from
                    the surface of the balls. In a three-ball match, the ball in any degree
                    interposing betλveen the player and the hole on the putting green, must be
                    played out.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Ball in Water, or in the Burn, and Place of
                    Re-teeing.—</hi> If the ball is in water, the player may take it out, change the
                    ball if he pleases, tee it, and play from behind the hazard, losing a stroke. If
                    the ball lies in any position in the burn across the first hole, the player may
                    take it out, tee it on the line where it entered the bum, on the opposite side
                    from the hole to which he is playing, and lose a stroke; or he may play it where
                    it lies, without a penalty. However, should a ball be driven into the Eden at
                    the high hole, or the sea at the first hole, the ball must be placed a
                    club-length in front of either sea or river, the player or party losing a
                    stroke. In playing for a medal, a ball driven into the Eden may be treated as a
                    lost ball.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="italic">Rubs of the Green.—</hi> Whatever happens to a ball by
                    accident, such as striking any person, or being touched with the foot by a third
                    party, or by the fore cady, must be reckoned a rub of the green, and submitted
                    to. If, however, the player’s ball strike his opponent, or his opponent’s cady
                    or clubs, the opponent loses the hole; or if he strikes himself or his partner,
                    or their cadies or clubs, or if he strikes the ball a second time while in the
                    act of playing, the player loses the hole. If the player touch the ball with his
                    foot, or any part of his body, or with anything except his club, or if he with
                    his club displace the ball in preparing to strike, he loses a stroke; and if one
                    party strikes his opponent’s ball with his club, foot, or otherwise, that party
                    loses the hole. But if he plays it inadvertently, thinking it his own, and the
                    opponent also plays the wrong ball, it is then too late to claim the penalty,
                    and the hole must be played out with the balls thus changed. If, however, the
                    mistake occurs from wrong information given by one party to the other, the
                    penalty cannot be claimed; and the mistake, if discovered before the other party
                    has played, must be rectified by replacing the ball as nearly as possible where
                    it lay. If the player’s ball be played away by mistake, or lifted by a third
                    party, then the player must drop a ball as near the spot as possible, without
                    any penalty. Whatever happens to a ball on a medal day, such as a player
                    striking his cady, or himself, or his clubs, or moving the ball with his foot or
                    club, or his cady doing so, or the player'striking it twice before it stops
                    motion, the player in such cases shall lose one stroke only as the penalty.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="italic">Ball Lost.—</hi> If a ball is lost, the player (or his
                    partner, in a double match) returns to the spot, as near as possible, where the
                    ball was struck, tees another ball, and loses both the distance and a stroke. If
                    the original ball is found before the party has struck the other ball, the first
                    shall continue the one to be played.</p>
                <p>XI. <hi rend="italic">Club Breaking.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> If, in
                    striking, the club breaks, it is nevertheless counted to be a stroke, if the
                    part of the club remaining in the player’s hand either strike the ground or pass
                    the ball.</p>
                <p>XII. <hi rend="italic">Holing out the Ball.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In
                    holing, no mar⅛ shall be placed, or line drawn, to direct the ball to the hole';
                    the ball must be played fairly and honestly for the hole, and not on your
                    opponent’s ball not being in the way to the hole; nor, although lying in the way
                    to the hole, is the player entitled to play with any strength upon it that might
                    injure his opponent’s position, or greater than is necessary honestly to send
                    your own ball the distance of the hole. Either party may smooth sand lying
                    around the hole, but this nuιst be done lightly and without pressure, or beating
                    down wit⅛Phe feet, club, or otherwise. If, in holing out, the ball rests upon
                    the flag-stick in the hole, the player shall be entitled to have the stick
                    removed, and if the ball falls in, it shall be considered as holed out; but
                    either party is entitled to have the flag-stick removed when approaching the
                    hole.</p>
                <p>XIII. <hi rend="italic">Unplaying</hi><hi rend="italic">Bails.—</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">Match</hi> playing every ball must be played, wherever it lies, or
                    the hole be given up, excepting when it lies on clothes, in water, or in the bed
                    of the burn (see Rules IV. and VIII. ), or in any of the holes, or short holes,
                    .made for golfing, in which latter case it may be lifted, dropped behind the
                    hazard, and played without losing a stroke. In <hi rend="italic">Medal</hi>
                    playing a ball may, under a penalty of two strokes, be lifted out of a
                    difficulty of any description, and teed behind the hazard, and if in any of the
                    golfing holes, it may be lifted, dropped, and played, without a penalty. In all
                    cases where a ball is to be dropped, the party doing so shall front the hole to
                    which he is playing, standing close on the hazard, and drop the ball behind him
                    from his head.</p>
                <p>XV. <hi rend="italic">Asking</hi><hi rend="italic">Advice.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> A player must not ask advice about the game, by word, look, or gesture,
                    from any one except his own cady, his partner’s cady, or his partner.</p>
                <p>XVIII. <hi rend="italic">Balls Splitting.—</hi> If a ball shall split into two or
                    more pieces, a fresh ball shall be put down where the largest portion of the
                    ball lies; and if a ball is cracked the player may change it on intimating his
                    intention of doing so to his opponent.</p>
                <p>XIX. <hi rend="italic">Breach of Rules,—</hi> Where no penalty for the
                    infringement of a rale is specially mentioned, the loss of the hole shall be
                    understood to be the penalty.</p>
                <p>Golf which, as we have seen, has a history of some interest, has also a
                    literature (copious in verse and prose), and a somewhat amusing anecdotage. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Golf, a Royal and Ancient Game,</hi> a work issued in 1875 by
                    Mr Robert Clark of Edinburgh, a well-known and accomplished adept, a very
                    careful collection will be found of everything connected with the game which in
                    this form deserves preservation. Through the ready kindness of the author this
                    admirable compendium has been available, and free use has been made of it, in
                    the preparation of this article. (P. P. A.) <pb break="no"
