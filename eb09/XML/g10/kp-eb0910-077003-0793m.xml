                    extending from the 19th to the 25th degree of N. lat., deriving its name from
                    the aboriginal tribe of <hi rend="italic">Gonds,</hi> who form the predominant
                    element in the population. The tract may be considered as comprising part of the

                    Nâgpur, and Sirguja, the petty native states on the S.W. frontier of Bengal, the
                    Cuttack Mahals, and the northern portion of Nâgpur. It is estimated to be 400
                    miles in length by 280 in average breadth. Gondwâna, in its most extensive
                    sense, includes all that part of India within the above-mentioned boundaries
                    which remained unconquered by the Mahometans up to the reign of Aurungzebe. But
                    Gondwâna proper is limited to four districts, named Mândla, Chlιatisgarh,
                    Nâgpur, and Chândal, and it stretches south along the east side of the Wardha
                    and Godâvari, to within 100 miles of the mouth of the latter. The greater part
                    of this province is a mountainous, unhealthy, and ill-watered country, covered
                    with jungle, and thinly inhabited; and to its poverty and other bad qualities
                    its independence may be ascribed. A continued chain of moderately elevated hills
                    extends from the southern frontier of Bengal almost to the Godâvari, and by
                    these the eastern was formerly separated from the western portion of the Nâgpur
                    dominions. This province contains the sources of the Nerbudda and the Son, and
                    is bounded by the Wardha and Godâvari; but a want of water is still the general
                    defect, the streams by which it is intersected, namely, the Mahânadi, Kârun,
                    Hatus, and Silâir, being inconsiderable, and not navigable within its limits.
                    The Gonds, or the hill tribes who took refuge in the mountains and fastnesses
                    from the invaders of the country, are the original inhabitants of the country,
                    and, till recently, retained all their primeval habits of barbarism. They have
                    now adopted a form of Hinduism, but they retain many of their ancient customs,
                    and abstain from no flesh except that of the ox, cow, and bull. According to the
                    census of 1872 they numbered 2,041,276, or nearly 25 per cent, of the entire
                    population of the Central Provinces. The more fertile tracts of Gondwâna were
                    subdued at an early period by the Marhattâs, who claimed as paramount over the
                    whole. The inhabitants were rendered nominally tributary; but it was found
                    impossible to collect any revenue from them without military force, so that, in
                    fact, the collection of the revenue was like a plundering expedition, the cost
                    of which always exceeded the profit.</p>

                <p>During the war against the Pindaris in 1818, when the British troops invaded the
                    territories of Appa Sahib, the raja of Nagpur, their operations were greatly
                    facilitated by the insurrection of the hill tribes, who occupied the passes into
                    the Nagpur territories. For a long series of years it was the policy of the raja
                    of this territory, a descendant of Sivaji, to interfere as little as possible
                    with the neighbouring powers. At length, in 1803, Raghoji Bhonsla was induced,
                    in an evil hour for himself, to depart from this system of neutrality, and to
                    join Sindhia in a confederacy against the British. He was soon reduced, however,
                    by the defeats which the confederates sustained at Assaye and Argaum, to sue for
                    peace, as the price of which he ceded a large portion of his dominions to the
                    conquerors, namely, the province of Orissa. After the death of this raja, the
                    throne, contested by various competitors, was at last secured by Appa Sahib, his
                    nephew, who, in the war against the Pindaris, joined the coalition against the
                    British power, and was involved in ruin along with his other allies. A treaty of
                    peace was concluded with him, which he violated; and he was finally deposed in
                    1818, and the grandson of the late raja put in his stead. The latter prince,
                    after a reign of 35 years, died without issue in 1853; the dynasty thus became
                    extinct, and the kingdom of Nagpur was incorporated with the British empire, and
                    now forms the chief commissionership of the Central Provinces.</p>
