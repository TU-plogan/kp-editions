                    ancl in later writers, to denote the whole of the territory occupied by the
                    Israelites eastward of Jordan, extending from the Arnon to the southern base of
                    Hermon (Deut, xxxiv. 1; Judg. xx. 1; Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> xii. 8.
                    3, 4). More precisely, however, it was the usual name of that mountainous
                    district which is bounded on the N.·by the Hieromax (Yarmuk), on the E. by the
                    Jordan, on the S. by the Arnon, and on the W. by a line which may be said to <pb

                    Rabbath-Ammon). It thus lay wholly within 31° 25' and 32° 42' N. lat., and 35°
                    34' and 36° E. long. Excluding the narrow strip of low-lying plain along the
                    Jordan, it has an average elevation of 2500 feet above the Mediterranean; but,
                    as seen from the west, the relative height is very much increased by the
                    depression of the Jordan valley. The range from the same point of view presents
                    a singularly uniform outline, having the appearance of an unbroken wall; in
                    reality, however, it is traversed by a number of deep ravines (wadys), of which
                    the most important are the Yâbis, the Ajlûn, the Râjib, the Zerka (Jabbok), the
                    Hesban, and the Zerka Main. The great mass of the Gilead range is formed of Jura
                    limestone, but there are also occasional veins of sandstone. The eastern slopes
                    are comparatively bare of trees; but the western are well supplied with oak,
                    terebinth, and pine. The pastures are everywhere luxuriant, and the wooded
                    heights and winding glens, in which the tangled shrubbery is here and there
                    broken up by open glades and flat meadows of green turf, exhibit a beauty of
                    vegetation such as is hardly to be seen in any other district of Palestine.</p>
                <p>The first mention of “Mount Gilead” in Scripture occurs in Gen. xxxι., where it
                    is said that the place where Jacob’s covenant with his father-in-law was
                    ratified was thenceforward called “the hill of witness” ("$?£). The locality
                    contemplated by the sacred writer was doubtless somewhere on the ridge of what
                    is now known as Jebel Ajlûn, and probably not far from Mahneh (Mahanaim), near
                    the head of the wady Yabis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Beke, Notes on an Excursion to Harran,” &amp;c., in vol. xxxii. of the
                    Journal of the Royal Geographical Society (1862). “It was not the river Jordan,
                    but the ridge of Mount Gilead, which formed the natural boundary of the
                    possessions of the children of Israel”</p></note> Gilead next comes under notice
                    in connexion with the partition of the promised land among the twelve tribes of
                    Israel. At the period of the conquest the portion of Gilead northward of the
                    Jabbok (Zerka) belonged to the dominions of Og, king of Bashan, while the
                    southern half was ruled by Sihon, king of the Amorites, having been at an
                    earlier date wrested from Moab (Numb. xxi. 24; Deut. iii. 12-16). These two
                    sections were allotted respectively to Manasseh and to Reuben and Gad, both
                    districts being peculiarly suited to the pastoral and nomadic character of these
                    tribes. A somewhat wild Bedouin disposition, fostered by their surroundings, was
                    retained by the Israelite inhabitants of Gilead to a late period of their
                    history, and seems to be to some extent discernible in what we read alike of
                    Jephthah, of David’s Gadites, and of the prophet Elijah.</p>
                <p>After the close of the Old Testament history the word Gilead seldom occurs. It
                    seems to have soon passed out of use as a precise geographical designation; for
                    though occasionally mentioned by Apocryphal writers, by Josephus, and by
                    Eusebius, the allusions are all vague, and show that those who made them had no
                    definite knowledge of Gilead proper. In Josephus and the New Testament the name
                    Peraea or <hi rend="italic">πepav</hi><hi rend="italic">του</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">ιopδdvov</hi> is most frequently used; and
                    the country is sometimes spoken of by Josephus as divided into small provinces
                    called after the capitals in which Greek colonists had established themselves
                    during the reign of the Seleucidae. At present Gilead south of the Jabbok alone
                    is known by the name of Jebel Jilad (Mount Gilead), the northern portion between
                    the Jabbok and the Yarmuk being called Jebel Ajlûn. Jebel Jilad includes Jebel
                    Osha, and has for its capital the town of Es-Salt. The cities of Gilead
                    expressly mentioned in Scripture are Ramoth, Jabesh, and Jazer. The first of
                    these has been satisfactorily identified with Es-Salt, and apparently ought not
                    to be regarded as distinct from Mizpeh (Judg. xi. 11, 34), called also
                    Mιzpeh-Gιlead (Judg. χi. 29), or Ramoth Mizpeh (Josh, xiii. 26).</p>
