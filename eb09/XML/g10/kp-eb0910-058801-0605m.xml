                    proceeded to Strasburg to study divinity; but finding that the theological
                    prelections of Schmidt and Spener there were not conducive to the growth of his
                    piety, he removed to Spires, where he entered the faculty of law. In 1664 he was
                    admitted an advocate at Ratisbon; but having become acquainted with the Baron
                    von Weitz, an Hungarian nobleman who cherished enthusiastic if not extravagant
                    schemes for the reunion of Christendom and the conversion of the world, he
                    abandoned all interest in his profession, and became an energetic promoter of
                    the “Christerbauliche Jesusgesellschaft,” or Christian Edification Society of
                    Jesus, in the interests of which he visited many parts of Germany and Holland.
                    The movement in its beginnings provoked at least no active hostility; but when
                    Gichtel began to attack the teaching of the Lutheran clergy and church,
                    especially upon the fundamental doctrine of justification by faith, he exposed
                    himself to a prosecution which ultimately resulted in sentence of banishment and
                    confiscation (1665). After many months of wandering and occasionally romantic
                    adventure, he in January 1667 reached Holland, and settled at Zwoll, where he
                    co-operated with Breckling, a man who shared his views and aspirations. Having
                    become involved in the troubles of this friend, Gichtel, after a period of
                    imprisonment, was banished for a term of years from Zwoll, but finally in 1668
                    found a home in Amsterdam, where in a state of poverty (which, however, never
                    became destitution), he lived out his strange life of visions and day-dreams, of
                    prophecy and prayer. He became ail ardent student and disciple of Jacob Boehme,
                    whose works he published in 1682 (Amsterdam, 2 vols.); but before the time of
                    his death, which occurred January 21, 1710, he had attracted to himself a small
                    band of followers known as Gichtelians or Angelic Brethren, who propagated
                    certain views at which he had arrived independently of Boehme. Seeking ever to
                    hear the authoritative voice of God within them, and endeavouring to attain to a
                    life altogether free from carnal desires, like that of “the angels in heaven,
                    who neither marry nor are given in marriage,” they claimed to exercise a
                    priesthood “after the order of Melchizedek,” appeasing the wrath of God, and
                    ransoming the souls of the lost by sufferings endured vicariously after the
                    example of Christ. The sect, never a numerous one, is said still to subsist in
                    some districts of Holland and North Germany. Gichtel’s correspondence was
                    published without his knowledge by Gottfried Arnold, a disciple, in 1701 (2
                    vols.), and again in 1708 (3 vols.). It has been frequently reprinted under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Theosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Practica.</hi> The
                    seventh volume of the Berlin edition (1768) contains a notice of Gichtel’s
                    life.</p>
