                    various other important offices in connexion with the university, and died 12th
                    December 1766. His chief works were a tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Der
                    sterbende</hi><hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> (Leipsic, 1732) —poor enough rubbish,
                    though it had great but shortlived popularity; <hi rend="italic">Deutsche
                    Schaubühne</hi> (1740-45), a collection of plays, some of which were written by
                    himself, his wife, J. C. Schlegel, and their friends, whilst others were
                    translated from the French classical dramatists; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xothiger</hi><hi rend="italic">Vorrath zur Gesichte der deutschen dramatischen
                    Dichtkunst</hi> (1757-1765), intended to contain an account of all previous
                    German plays Though not complete, the last is a very valuable and important
                    work. Besides these, Gottsched wrote a number of educational works, and edited
                    several journals devoted to literary criticism. He was a pedant, but there is no
                    doubt that he did good and lasting service to German literature. When he began
                    to write, the stage was occupied by plays in which extravagant rant did duty for
                    eloquence, coarse vulgarity for wit, and the wildest improbabilities for
                    inventive incident. In the writings of the second Silesian school the utmost
                    extent of absurdity was reached. Gottsched set his face against such
                    productions. He enunciated rules by which the playwright must be bound; he
                    insisted on the observance of the dramatic unities, and pointed to the French
                    drama as the best possible model for the German stage; moreover, his criticism
                    did much to regulate and purify the German language. Unfortunately he went too
                    far. He placed himself in opposition to the Swiss writers Bodmer and Breitinger,
                    who were bringing before the German public several of the great English writers,
                    more especially Milton; he refused to recognize the rising genius of Klopstock
                    and Lessing, and still went on enunciating rules when the time for that was
                    past, and praising mediocre writers as if they had been great geniuses. So it
                    came to pass that his influence speedily declined, and that before his death his
                    name became almost proverbial for pedantic folly. Of all lots his was the
                    hardest, for he outlived his own reputation. His wife, Luise Adelgunde Victorie
                    Kulmus (1713— 1762), was his faithful helper in his literary labours, and
                    herself an authoress of reputation. Among other works she translated the <hi

                    >Raf)e of the Lock</hi> (1744, new ed. 1772). After her death her husband edited
                    her <hi rend="italic">Gedichte,</hi> with a memoir (1763). See DanzeΓs <hi
