                    political reformer and philosophical radical, attempted to trace his pedigree to
                    a time before the Norman conquest and the great Earl Godwine. His father was a
                    cold and dull man, his mother uneducated, but clever, shrewd, and full of sound
                    common sense. Both parents were Calvinists: the father strict in observances
                    beyond what was even then ordinary; the mother regretting in Godwin’s maturer
                    years, and when some of her sons had turned out ill, that she had given birth to
                    so many children, who, as she thought, were heirs of damnation. Mr Godwin,
                    senior, died young, and never inspired love or much regret in his son; but in
                    spite of wide differences of opinion, the most tender affection always subsisted
                    between William Godwin and his mother, until her death at an advanced age.</p>
                <p>William Godwin was educated for his father’s profession, and was at first more
                    Calvinistic than his teachers, becoming a Sandemanian, of which sect he says,
                    that they were the followers of “a celebrated north-country apostle [Gias], who
                    after Calvin had damned ninety-nine in a hundred of mankind, has contrived a
                    scheme for damning ninety-nine in a hundred of the followers of Calvin.”</p>
                <p>He officiated as a minister at Ware, Stowmarket, and Beaconsfield. At the second
                    of these places the teachings of French Reformers were brought before him by a
                    friend, and these, while they intensified his political, undermined his
                    religious opinions. He came to London, still nominally a clergyman, to set about
                    the work of the regeneration of society with his pen—a real enthusiast, who,
                    theoretically, shrank from no conclusions from the premises which he laid down.
                    These were the principles of the Encyclopedists, and his own aim was the
                    complete overthrow of all existing institutions, political, social, and
                    religious. He believed, however, that calm discussion was the only thing needful
                    to carry every change, and from the beginning to the end of his career he
                    deprecated every approach to violence. He was, like Bentham—-whom, however, he
                    does not seem to have influenced or been influenced by—a philosophic radical in
                    the strictest sense of the term.</p>
                <p>His first published work was au anonymous <hi rend="italic">Life of Lord
                    Chatham·,</hi> the first to which he gave his name was still nominally clerical.
                    Under the inappropriate title <hi rend="italic">Sketches of History,</hi> he
                    published six sermons on the characters of Aaron, Hazael, and Jesus, in which,
                    though writing in the character of an orthodox Calvinist, he enunciates the
                    pregnant proposition, “God himself has no right to be a tyrant.” This was
                    published in 1782, and for the next nine years he wrote largely in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> and other periodicals, producing also three
                    novels, which have more completely vanished from the world than even the
                    contributions to reviews. They were probably not worth preserving, but the
                    “Sketches of English History” written for the <hi rend="italic">Annual
                    Register</hi> from 1785 onward still deserve study. He joined a club called the
                    Revolutionists, and associated much with Lord Stanhope, Horne Tooke, Holcroft,
                    and others, who, from their political principles and activity, were obnoxious to
                    men in power. It is perhaps needless to say that the title of “reverend” dropped
                    off from him without difficulty, and with no sense of discordance between the
                    old and the new. Doubt and change never seem to have brought with them any keen
                    sense of pain or outrooting. The equable calm of a cold temperament preserved
                    him from much which affects warmer natures; but he also knew that he was at all
                    times seeking after truth, and striving for what seemed right; and while such an
                    one can scarcely be called modest, he is preserved for many qualms which affect
                    more nervous and more selfdistrustful persons.</p>
                <p>In 1793 Godwin published his great work on political science, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Inquiry concerning Political Justice, and its Influence on General Virtue
                    and Happiness.</hi> Although this work is little known and less read now, it was
                    one of the epoch-making books of English thought, Godwin could never have been
                    himself a worker on the active stage of life. But he was none the less a power
                    behind the workers, and <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> takes its place
                    with Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Speech for Unlicensed Printing,</hi> with
                    Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Education,</hi> with Rousseau’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Émile,</hi> among the unseen levers which have moved the changes
                    of the times. It is therefore necessary to speak of this book more particularly.
                    By the words “political justice” the author meant “the adoption of any principle
                    of morality and truth into the practice of a community,” and the work was
                    therefore an inquiry into the principles of society, of government, and of
                    morals. For many vears Godwin had been “satisfied <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0741-0718"/> that monarchy was a species of government
                    unavoidably corrupt,”and from desiring a government of the simplest
                    construction, he gradually came to consider that “government by its very nature
                    counteracts the improvement of original mind.” Believing in the perfectibility
                    of the race, that there are no innate principles, and therefore no original
                    propensity to evil, he considered that “our virtues and our vices may be traced
                    to the incidents which make the history of our lives, and if these incidents
                    could be divested of every improper tendency, vice would be extirpated from the
                    world.” All control of man by man was more or less intolerable, and the day
                    would come when each mau, doing what seems right in his own eyes, would also be
                    doing what is in fact best for the community, because all will be guided by
                    principles of pure reason. But all was to be done by discussion, and matured
                    change resulting from discussion. Hence, while Godwin thoroughly approved of the
                    philosophic schemes of the precursors of the Revolution, he was as far removed
                    as Burke himself from agreeing with the way in which they were carried out. So
                    logical and uncompromising a thinker as Godwin could not go far in the
                    discussion of abstract questions without exciting the most lively opposition in
                    matters of detailed opinion An affectionate son, and ever ready to give of his
                    hard-earned income to more than one ne’er-do-well brother, he maintained that
                    natural relationship had no claim on man, nor was gratitude to parents or
                    benefactors any part of justice or virtue. In a day when the penal code was
                    still extremely severe, he argued gravely against all punishments, not only that
                    of death. Property was to belong to him who most wants it; accumulated property
                    was a monstrous injustice. Hence marriage, which is law, is the worst of all
                    laws, and property the worst of all properties. A man so passionless as Godwin
                    could venture thus to argue without suspicion that he did so only to gratify his
                    wayward desires. Portions of this treatise, and only portions, found ready
                    acceptance in those minds which were prepared to receive them. Perhaps no one
                    received the whole teaching of the book. But it gave cohesion and voice to
                    philosophic radicalism; it was the manifesto of a school without which the
                    milder and more creedless liberalism of the present day had not been. Godwin
                    himself in after days modified his communistic views, but his strong feeling for
                    individualism, his hate of all restrictions on liberty, his trust in man, his
                    faith in the power of reason remained; it was a manifesto which enunciated
                    principles modifying action, even when not wholly ruling it.</p>
                <p>In May 1794 Godwin published the novel of <hi rend="italic">Caleb Williams, or
                    Things as they are,</hi> a book of which the political object is overlooked by
                    many readers in the strong interest of the story. It is one of the few novels of
                    that time which may be said still to live. A theorist who lived mainly in his
                    study, Godwin yet came forward boldly to stand by prisoners arraigned of high
                    treason in that same year—1794. The danger to persons so charged was then great,
                    and he deliberately put himself into this same danger for his friends. But when
                    his own trial was discussed in the Privy Council, Pitt sensibly held that <hi
                    rend="italic">Political Justice,</hi> the work on which the charge could best
                    have been founded, was priced at three guineas, and could never do much harm
                    among those who had not three shillings to spare.</p>
                <p>From this time Godwin became anotable figure in London society, and there was
                    scarcely an important person in politics, on the liberal side, in literature,
                    art, or science, who does not appear familiarly in the pages of Godwin’s
                    singular diary. For forty-eight years, beginning in 1788, and continuing to the
                    very eud of his life, Godwin kept a record of every day, of the work he did, the
                    books he read, the friends he saw. Condensed in the highest degree, the diary is
                    yet easy to read when the style is once mastered, and it is a great help to the
                    understanding of his cold, methodical, unimpassioned characters. He carried his
                    method into every detail of life, and lived on his earnings with extreme
                    frugality. Until he made a large sum by the publication of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Political Justice,</hi> he lived on an average of .£120 a year. In 1797, the
                    intervening years having been spent in strenuous literary labour, Godwin married
                    Mary Wollstonecraft (see last article). Since both held the same views regarding
                    the slavery of marriage, and since they only married at all for the sake of
                    possible offspring, the marriage was concealed for some time, and the happiness
                    of the avowed married life was very brief. Mrs Godwin died in giving birth to a
                    daughter, afterwards the second wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley, on September 10,
                    1797, leaving Godwin, prostrated by affliction, and with a charge for which he
                    was wholly unfit—his own little daughter Mary, and her stepsister, Fanny Imlay,
                    who ever afterwards bore the name of Godwin. His unfitness for the cares of a
                    family, far more than love, led him to contract a second marriage with Mrs
                    Clairmont, in 1800. She was a widow with two children, energetic and
                    painstaking, but a harsh stepmother; and it may be doubted whether the children
                    were not worse off under her care than they would have been under Godwin’s
                    neglect. The second fiction which proceeded from Godwin’s pen was called <hi
                    rend="italic">St Leon,</hi> and published in 1799. It is chiefly remarkable for
                    the beautiful portrait of Marguerite, the heroine, which was drawn from the
                    character of his own wife.</p>
                <p>The events of Godwin’s life were few. Under the advice of the second Mrs Godwin,
                    and with her active co-operation, he carried on business as a bookseller under
                    the pseudonym of Edward Baldwin, under which name he published several useful
                    school-books and books for children, some by Charles and Mary Lamb. But the
                    speculation was unsuccessful, and for many years Godwin struggled with constant
                    pecuniary difficulties, for which more than one subscription was raised by the
                    leaders of the Liberal party, and by literary men. In his later years the
                    Government of Earl Grey conferred upon him the office known as “Yeoman Usher of
                    the Exchequer,” to which were attached apart· ments in Palace Yard, where he
                    died in the full posses, sion of his faculties, April 7, 1836, having completed
                    his eightieth year.</p>
                <p>In his own time, by his writings and by his conversation, Godwin had a great
                    power of influencing men, and especially young men. Though his character would
                    seem, from much which is found in his writings, and from anecdotes told by those
                    who still remember him, to have been unsympathetic, it was not so understood by
                    enthusiastic young people, who hung on his words as those of a prophet. The most
                    remarkable of these was Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in the glowing dawn of his
                    genius turned to Godwin as his teacher and guide. The last of the long series of
                    young men who sat at Godwin’s feet was Edward Lytton Bulwer, afterwards Lord
                    Lytton, whose early romances were formed after those of Godwin, and who, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Eugene Aram,</hi> succeeded to the story as arranged, and the plan
                    to a considerable extent sketched out, by Godwin, whose age and failing health
                    prevented him from completing it.</p>
                <p>Godwin’s more important works <hi rend="italic">are—The Inquiry concerning

                    his daughter Mrs Shelley. Many other short and anonymous works proceeded from
                    his ever busy pen, but many are irrecoverable, and all are forgotten. Godwin’s
                    place in literature is permanent, in that he produced one work which proved
                    effective in changing the course of thought in its time, but not permanent in
                    the sense that his writings will continue to be widely read. His life was
                    published in 1876 in two volumes, under the title <hi rend="italic">lVilliam

                    of his literary position is that given by Mr Leslie Stephen in his <hi
