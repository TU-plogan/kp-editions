                    licensed a preacher of the university; and three years afterwards he became
                    lecturer of Trinity Church, to the vicarage of which he was presented by the
                    king in 1632. Harassed by the interferences of his bishop, who was a zealous
                    adherent of Laud, he resigned all his preferments and left the university in
                    1634. He then seems to have lived for some time in London, where in 1638 he
                    married the daughter of an aiderman; but, in the following year, he found it
                    expedient to withdraw to Holland, and for some time was pastor of a small
                    congregation of English merchants and refugees at Arnheim. Returning to London
                    soon after Laud’s impeachment by the Long Parliament, he ministered for some
                    years to an Independent congregation in the parish of St Dunstan’s-in-the-East,
                    and rapidly rose to considerable eminence as a preacher; in 1643 he was chosen a
                    member of the Westminister Assembly, and at once identified himself with the
                    Congregational party, generally referred to in contemporary documents as “the
                    dissenting brethren.” He frequently preached by appointment before the Commons,
                    and in January 1650 his talents and learning were rewarded by the House with the
                    presidentship of Magdalen College, Oxford, a post which he held until the period
                    of the Restoration. He rose into high favour with the Protector, and ultimately
                    became somewhat prominent among his more intimate advisers. From 1660 until his
                    death, which occurred on the 23d of February 1679, he lived in London, and
                    devoted himself exclusively to theological study and to the pastoral charge of a
                    small congregation which his piety and intellectual abilities had attached to
                    him.</p>
                <p>The works published by Goodwin during his lifetime consist chiefly of sermons
                    printed by order of the House of Commons; but he was also associated with Nye
                    and others in the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Apologeticall
                    Narration</hi> (1643). His collected writings, which include expositions of
                    considerable portions of the Epistle to the Ephesians and of the Apocalypse,
                    were published in five folia volumes between 1681 and 1704, and have recently
                    been reprinted in twelve 8vo volumes (Edin. 1861-66). Characterized by great yet
                    one-sided reading, remarkable at once for the depth and for the narrowness of
                    their observation and spiritual experience, often admirably thorough in their
                    workmanship, yet in style prolix to a degree that, by modern readers at least,
                    is sometimes found to be almost intolerable,—they fairly exemplify both the
                    merits and the defects of the special school of religious thought to which they
                    belong. Calainy’s estimate of Goodwin’s qualities may be quoted as both friendly
                    and just. “He was a considerable scholar and an eminent divine, and had a very
                    happy faculty in descanting upon Scripture so as to bring forth surprising
                    remarks, which yet generally tended to illustration.” A memoir, derived from his
                    own papers, by his son is prefixed to the fifth volume of his collected works;
                    as a “patriarch and Atlas of Independency” he is also noticed by Wood in the <hi

                    sketch, from Addison’s point of view, of the Puritan president of Magdalen’s is
                    to be met with in No. 494 of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator.</hi></p>
