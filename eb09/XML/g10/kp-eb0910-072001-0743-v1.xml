                <p><label type="entry">GODWIT</label>, a word of unknown origin, the name commonly
                    applied to a marsh-bird in great repute, when fattened, for the table, and
                    formerly abundant in the fens of Norfolk, the Isle of Ely, and Lincolnshire. In
                    Turner’s days (1544) it was worth three times as much as a Snipe, and at the
                    same period Belon said of it—“C’est vn Oyseau es delices des Françoys.”
                    Casaubon, who Latinized its name <hi rend="italic">“Dei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ingenium”</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ephemerides,</hi> 19 th September 1G11),
                    was told by the “<hi rend="italic">ornithotrophomιs</hi>” he visited at Wisbech
                    that in London it fetched twenty pence. Its fame as a delicacy is perpetuated by
                    many later writers, Ben Jonson among them, and Pennant says that in his time
                    (1766) it sold for half-a-crown or five shillings. Under the name Godwit two
                    perfectly distinct species of British birds were included, but that which seems
                    to havo been especially prized fs known to modern ornithologists as the
                    Black-tailed Godwit, <hi rend="italic">Limosa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >oegocephala,</hi> formerly called, from its loud cry, a Yarwhelp,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This name seems to have
                            survived in Whelp Moor, near Brandon, in Suffolk.</p></note> Shrieker,
                    or Barker, in the districts it inhabited. The practice of netting this bird in
                    large numbers during the spring and summer, coupled with the gradual reclamation
                    of the fens, to which it resorted, has now rendered it but a visitor; and it
                    probably ceased from breeding regularly in England in 1824 or thereabouts,
                    though under favourable conditions it may have occasionally laid its eggs for
                    some thirty years later or more (Stevenson, <hi rend="italic">Birds of
                        Horfolk,</hi> ii. p. 250). This Godwit is a species of wide range, reaching
                    Iceland, where it is called <hi rend="italic">Jardrceka</hi> ( = earth-raker),
                    in summer, and occurring numerously, it is said, in India in winter. Its chief
                    breeding-quarters seem to extend from Holland eastwards to the south of Russia.
                    The second British species is that which is known as the Bar-tailed Godwit, <hi
                        rend="italic">L. lappoηica,</hi> and this seems to have never been more than
                    a bird of double passage in the United Kingdom, arriving in large flocks on the
                    south coast about the 12 th of May, and, after staying a few days, proceeding to
                    the north-eastward. It is known to breed in Lapland, but its eggs are of great
                    rarity. Towards autumn the young visit our coasts, and a few of them remain,
                    together with some of the other species, in favourable situations throughout the
                    winter. One of the local names by which the Bar-tailed Godwit is known to the
                    Norfolk gunners is Scamell, a word which, in the mouth of Caliban <hi
                        rend="italic">(Tempest,</hi> act ii. scene 2), has been the cause of much
                    perplexity to Shakespearian critics.</p>
                <p>The Godwits belong to the group <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> and are about
                    as big as a tame Pigeon, but possess long legs, and a long bill with a slight
                    upward turn. It is believed that in the genus <hi rend="italic">Limosa</hi> the
                    female is larger than the male. While the winter plumage is of a sober
                    greyish-brown, the breeding-dress is marked by a predominance of bright bay or
                    chestnut, rendering the wearer a very beautiful object. The Blacktailed Godwit,
                    though varying a good deal in size, is constantly larger than the Bar-tailed,
                    and especially longer in the legs. The species may be further distinguished by
                    the former having the proximal third of the tail-quills pure white, and the
                    distal two-thirds black, with a narrow white margin, while the latter has the
                    same feathers barred with black and white alternately for nearly their whole
                    length.</p>
                <p>America possesses two species of the genus, the very large Marbled Godwit or
                    Marlin, <hi rend="italic">L. fedoa,</hi> easily recognized by its size and the
                    buff colour of its axillaries, and the smaller Hudsonian Godwit, <hi
                        rend="italic">L. hudsonicα,</hi> which has its axillaries of a deep black.
                    This last, though less numerous than its congener, seems to range over the whole
                    of the continent, breeding in the extreme north, while it has been obtained also
                    in the Strait of Magellan and the Falkland Islands. The first seems not to go
                    further southward than the Antilles and the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
                <p>From Asia, or at least its eastern part, two species have been described. One of
                    them, <hi rend="italic">L. melanuroides,</hi> differs only from <hi
                        rend="italic">L. αgocephala</hi> in its smaller size, and is believed to
                    breed in Amurland, wintering in the islands of the Pacific, Nev; Zealand, and
                    Australia. The other, <hi rend="italic">L. urορygialis,</hi> is closely allied
                    to and often mistaken for <hi rend="italic">L. lapponiea,</hi> from which it
                    chiefly differs by having the rump barred like the tail. This was found breeding
                    in the extreme north of Siberia by Dr von Middendorff, and ranges to Australia,
                    whence it was, like the last, first described by Mr Gould, <hi rend="smallcaps"
