                    somewhat vague sense, the term Celtice (∙&gt;) <hi rend="italic"
                    >^K,eλτικη),</hi> calling its inhabitants Celts (Keλroi). Later we find Galatia
                    (Γαλατία) and Gallia (Γαλλία), with the corresponding Galati (Γαλάτοι) and Galli
                    (Γάλλοι), used as nearly synonymous with the earlier name. The shorter of these
                    two forms the Romans adopted; and in the opening chapter of Caesar’s well-known
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> we have our first definite account of the
                    limits of the country and its divisions, as then understood. According to this
                    authority, Gaul was in his day divided among three peoples, more or less
                    distinct from one another, the Aquitani, the Gauls, who called themselves Celts,
                    and the Belgae. The first of these extended from the Pyrenees to the Garumna
                    (Garonne); the second from that river to the Sequana (Seine) and its chief
                    tributary the Matrona (Marne), reaching eastward presumably as far as the Rhenus
                    (Rhine); and the third from this bounding line to the mouth of the last-named
                    river, thus bordering on the Germans. By implication Caesar recognizes a fourth
                    division, the Provincia, lying to the south in the basin of the Rhodanus
                    (Rhone), and stretching westwards as far as Tolosa (Toulouse) in the basin of
                    the Garonne—a portion of Gaul that had been subdued and made a Roman province
                    about fifty years before Caesar entered on his career of conquest there. By far
                    the greater part of the country was a plain watered by numerous rivers,-the
                    chief of which have already been mentioned, with the exception of its great
                    central stream, the Liger or Ligeris (Loire). Its principal mountain ranges were
                    Cebenna or Gehenna (Cevennes) in the south, and Jura, with its continuation
                    Vosegus or Vogesus (Vosges), in the east. The tribes inhabiting Gaul in Caesar’s
                    time, and belonging to one or other of the three races distinguished by him,
                    were numerous. Prominent among them, and dwelling in the division occupied by
                    the Celts, were the Helvetii, the Sequani, and the Aedui, in the basins of the
                    Rhodanus and its tributary the Arar (Saône), who, he says, were reckoned the
                    three most powerful nations in all Gaul; the Arverni in the mountains of
                    Cebenna; the Senones and Carnutes in the basin of the Liger; the Veneti and
                    other Armorican tribes between the mouths of the Liger and Sequana. The Nervii,
                    Bellovaci, Suessiones, Remi, Morini, Menapii, and Aduatici were Belgic tribes;
                    the Tarbelli and others were Aquitani; while the Allobroges inhabited the north
                    of the Provincia, having been conquered in 121 B.c.</p>
                <p>The ethnological relations of Caesar’s three great Gallic races have given rise
                    to much discussion. Greek writers, who, in consequence of the planting of the
                    colony of Massilia (Marseilles) on its southern coast at so early a period as
                    600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> had gained some knowledge of Gaul before the
                    Romans, speak of its inhabitants as Ligurians; and it is certain that a people
                    of this name occupied at one time the coast-line of Europe from the western
                    slopes of the maritime Alps to the Rhone. By many these Ligurians are regarded
                    as having once spread themselves over a much wider area, peopling extensive
                    tracts of Europe as well as Northern Africa. Subsequently, another race, coming
                    probably across the Pyrenees from Spain, subdued south-western Gaul and ruled as
                    far north as the Garonne—the Basques of the two slopes of these mountains
                    remaining to our own day their lineal representatives. Later still, but at a
                    date which history does not venture to fix, one of those great waves of
                    population that are believed to have rolled in succession from east to west
                    brought into northern and central Gaul, it may be at an interval of centuries,
                    the two great branches of the Celtic race, the Gadhelic or Gaelic and the
                    Cymric—the one represented in Britain by the Irish and Scottish Highlanders, the
                    other by the Welsh. Reading Caesar’s brief statements by the light thus
                    afforded, ethnologists now generally hold that his Aquitani were Iberians,
                    largely intermingled with intrusive Gauls; that his Gauls belonged to the Gaelic
                    division of the Celtic race, and his Belgae to the Cymric (both of them,
                    however, being affected by the presence of races whose territory they had
                    overrun, and the latter by the addition of a German element derived from their
                    proximity to the Rhine); and that the natives of the Provincia were Ligurians,
                    with so large an intermixture of Celts as to make the latter the dominant race.
                    Neither the Qreek colony of Massilia, nor those colonies sent out by it, can be
                    supposed to have seriously affected the Gaulish nation from the point of view we
                    are now discussing. It was in a different manner, as a civilizing agency, that
                    they made their presence felt.</p>
                <p>Such, it would appear, was Gaul ethnologically when made a part of the Roman
                    empire by Julius Caesar shortly before the commencement of the Christian era;
                    and, as has often been remarked, such in the main it is still. Some recent
                    scientific inquirers find grounds, however, for concluding<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0121-0112"/> that the opinion, so prevalent not only in
                    England but in France itself, that the physical and mental characteristics of
                    the modern Frenchman are chiefly derived from the ancient Gauls, is only in part
                    well founded. The Gauls, they say, like the Romans after them, were strong
                    enough to impose their language on a race or races they had subjugated; but in
                    the attempt to absorb them they themselves have suffered and continue to suffer
                    so much that the day may yet come when the older race will all but regain its
                    superiority. Slowly but surely, according to the researches of Μ. Roget, Baron
                    de Belloguet, the blue-eyed, fair-haired, long-headed Celt has for many
                    generations been giving place throughout France, in a direction proceeding from
                    south to north, to a more ancient, dark-eyed, black-haired, round-headed man—a
                    similar phenomenon being also noticeable among the Germans.</p>
                <p>Northern Italy, in consequence of an intrusion of Gauls at some early date,
                    received from the Romans the name of Gallia Cisalpina or Citerior, to
                    distinguish it from Gaul proper, called also Gallia Transalpina or Ulterior.
                    Afterwards when the Roman element gained the upper hand, Togata was sometimes
                    substituted for Cisalpina; while in contradistinction, Gallia Braccata was
                    applied to the Provincia from the <hi rend="italic">braccoe</hi> or trousers
                    worn by the natives, and Gallia Comata to the rest of the country, from the
                    inhabitants wearing their hair long. The Gaulish emigrations into Spain on the
                    one hand, and into Britain on the other, scarcely come under the present
                    article; still less can we refer here to the inroads of that restless race into
                    various parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. But it may be remarked in
                    passing that so extensive were the conquests of the Gauls that, in the beginning
                    of the third century before our era, their empire, if much less compact, was
                    scarcely less extensive than that of Rome in her palmiest days.</p>
                <p>For some time after the death of Caesar little attention could be paid to Gaul by
                    the ruling powers at Rome; but in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Augustus,
                    now master of the Roman world, took measures to Romanize it thoroughly. The old
                    division into four provinces was retained, and made subservient to
                    administrative purposes. The Provincia, however, received the name of Gallia
                    Narbonnensis, from the Roman town of Narbo (Narbonne); the boundaries of
                    Aquitania were extended to the Liger; what remained of Caesar’s Gauls were
                    constituted the province of Gallia Lugdunensis, so named from its capital, the
                    new settlement of Lugdunum (Lyons); and the northern division was called Gallia
                    Belgica. This arrangement remained nearly unchanged till the 4th century, when
                    the four provinces were broken up into seventeen, each with a capital and a
                    number of other towns of more or less importance, the names of which may be
                    found in the larger geographical and historical works that treat of the period.
                    While an integral part of the Roman empire Gaul often played no mean part in the
                    contests that took place for the imperial purple; and it was during one of these
                    that Claudius Civilis, a Romanized Gaul, made a gallant attempt to achieve the
                    independence of his country. His efforts, however, were not supported by the
                    mass of the people, and the movement was crushed by Vespasian. Perhaps the most
                    noteworthy event of those centuries was the insurrection of the Bagaudae or
                    peasant banditti, in the reign of Diocletian. Ruined and driven to despair by
                    the exactions of the imperial treasury, men scoured the country in marauding
                    bands, plundering wholesale. Though the revolt was suppressed, the lesson it
                    ought to have taught Rome was unheeded, and thus the seeds of future troubles
                    remained in the soil. Tn the declining days of the empire Gaul became a prey to
                    the Visigoths in the south, the Burgundians in the east, and the Franks in the
                    north-east. When order had arisen out of the confusion that ensued, the country
                    was found to have taken under a new name a still more conspicuous place in the
                    political system of Europe.</p>
