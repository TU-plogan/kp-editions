                    <hi rend="italic">(Theatre ιVHonneur</hi><hi rend="italic">et de
                    Chevalerie),</hi> was derived from the Oriental mode of contracting sales of
                    land and the like by giving the purchaser a glove, by way of delivery or
                    investiture; and to this effect he quotes Ruth iv. 7 and Psa. cviii. 9, passages
                    where the word commonly translated “shoe” is by some rendered “glove.” Du Cange
                    quotes from a charter of the 13th century an instance of re-investiture or
                    restitution symbolized by the person depositing his glove on the earth. The use
                    of gloves is of high antiquity. There is reason to believe the ancient Persians
                    wore them, since it is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Cyropoedia</hi> of
                    Xenophon that on one occasion Cyrus went without his gloves; and we know that
                    some kind of protecting coverings for the hands were used by the Greeks and
                    Romans in certain kinds of manual labour, although their precise form is
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">ganius,</hi> used for a glove in mediaeval Latin, is
                    obviously of Teutonic derivation. In the life of St Columbanus, written by
                    Jonas, abbot of Bobbio, in the 7th century, gloves for protecting the hands in
                    manual labour are spoken of as “tegumenta manuum quae Galli <hi rend="italic"
                    >wantos</hi> vocant.” A pair of gloves are mentioned in the will of Bishop
                    Riculfus, who died 915 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Gloves did not become
                    articles of ecclesiastical vestment till the 12th century. They do not appear in
                    the Bayeux tapestry, and they did not come into general use in England till the
                    13th century. Matthew Paris, noticing the burial of Henry II. (1189), mentions
                    that he was buried in his coronation robes, with a golden crown on his head and
                    gloves on his hands. Gloves were also found on the hands of King John when his
                    tomb was opened in 1797, and on the hands of Edward I. when his tomb was opened
                    in 1774. In the 14th century they w ere in common use among the better classes.
                    In the 16th century they were frequently embroidered with great elaboration, and
                    in the reign of Charles II. the short sleeves of the ladies’ dresses brought in
                    long gloves reaching almost to the elbow. It is an old custom in England that a
                    pair of gloves are given by the sheriff to the judge who presides at a maiden
                    assize; and in Scotland white gloves are given to the judges on a maiden
                    circuit,—that is, when there are no cases for trial.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of gloves was early introduced into the British Islands, and such
                    was the dignity of the craft that, as early as the reign of King Robert III.,
                    the incorporation of glovers of Perth was chartered—a wealthy guild still
                    existing, although the calling has long ceased to characterize that town. The
                    glovers’ company of London received its armorial bearings as early as 1464, but
                    the body was not chartered till 1638; and in Worcester, which has long been the
                    principal British centre of the trade, a company was incorporated in 1661.</p>
                <p>The glove industry of the present day is both extensive and diversified, seeing
                    that gloves are now almost universally worn, and made of various classes of
                    material and in several different ways. Of yarn, thread, silk, and cloth gloves
                    it is unnecessary to speak, as these varieties are, in comparison with leather
                    gloves, of comparatively little importance. The leather employed by glovers is
                    prepared from the skins of deer, sheep and lambs, goats aud kids— the last being
                    by far the most important. The skins are prepared either by the ordinary
                    processes of shamoying for wash-leather and doe or buck leather gloves, or by a
                    special method of tawing in the case of ordinary dress gloves. The kid-skins are
                    principally collected by hawkers in the South European countries, aud sold in
                    the Leipsic and Naples fairs. The tawing industry is conducted on a great scale
                    at Annonay, Paris, and Milhau in France. The tawing process differs from
                    ordinary tanning in the greater care and cleanliness of all the operations, in
                    the submission of the dressed skins to a brief fermentation by piling them under
                    the influence of heat, which increases the softness and flexibility of the
                    leather, and in tawing with a∙ mixture of flour, the yellow of eggs, and alum.
                    On the completion of this operation, they are stretched by hand and dried as
                    rapidly as possible. Thereafter they are damped, placed in dozens between linen
                    cloths, and worked about to render them soft and pliable, after which they are
                    planed on the flesh side, dried, and again planed. They are then polished by
                    rubbing with a heavy glass disc or other smooth substance, and dyed by brushing
                    liquid dyes over one side. Finally they are stretched on a marble table, and
                    smoothed with a blunt knife. From a kid skin so prepared the materials of three
                    gloves are obtained. The skins are moistened and stretched, and the various
                    parts are cut out by a machine having steel punches the shape and size desired.
                    The thumb piece, the quirks and the fourchettes inserted between the fingers,
                    and the wrist welt—the latter frequently white—are cut out separately. Machine
                    sewing, in which a kind of button stitch is made, is to a small extent utilized
                    in the manufacture of gloves; but the greater part of the sewing is done by
                    hand. The pieces to be sewn together are placed in a machine between a pair of
                    jaws, the holding edge of which is composed of fine saw teeth, between each of
                    which the sewer passes back and forward her needle, and in this way a neat
                    uniform stitch is secured. There are three kinds of hand-sewing in the glove
                    trade— round sewing or ordinary glove stitch, piqué stitch, and prick seam.
                    After sewing, the backs are stitched or tamboured, the button-hole is formed,
                    the wrist attached, and the button sewed on, thus finishing the glove. After
                    damping and stretching to its utmost length, the glove is ready to be stamped
                    and put up for use.</p>
                <p>Paris is, beyond question, the most important centre of glove-making, and for
                    delicacy of material and beauty of workmanship the productions of some Parisian
                    manufacturers are without any rivals; but it is at Grenoble that French gloves
                    are most extensively manufactured. English gloves, of unfailing excellence of
                    material and workmanship, are principally made at Worcester; and in one
                    specialty— “dogskin” gloves made from Cape sheep-skin, having a warm tan
                    colour—English makers have no competitors. A very large quantity of cheap but
                    useful gloves are made at Brusselsand Copenhagen. During the year 1876,1,084,400
                    dozen pairs, of a value of £1,380,884, were imported into <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0716-0693"/> the United Kingdom from France; from Belgium
                    there were 301,305 dozen pairs, valued at £345,174; and the total imports from
                    all quarters amounted to 1,497,437 dozen pairs, of a value of £1,840,956. In
                    1878 the total imports were 1,060,040 dozen pairs, valued at £1,302,060.</p>
                <p>Buckskin gloves are largely made in the United States, and that branch, together
                    with a limited production of kid and other gloves, is chiefly centred in the
                    village of Gloversville, Fulton co., N.Y. It is estimated that from about 140
                    separate glove factories in that village not less than two-thirds of the gloves
                    made in the United States are sent out. Kid gloves are made to some extent in
                    New York city.</p>
