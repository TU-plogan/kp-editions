                <p><label type="entry">GLOBE</label>. With the exception of illuminated portolani,
                    the most interesting monuments of geography are globes. Celestial globes are
                    much more ancient than terrestrial ones. The earliest of these with which we are
                    acquainted is one made of copper engraved in the Arab-Cufic character of the 11
                    th century. It is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris, Sect. Géog.,
                    No. 396 (see fig. 1). In Italy the emperor Frederick II. (1197-1250) possessed a
                    celestial globe of gold, probably also of Arab manufacture, on which the stars
                    were indicated by pearls; from the scanty information that has come down to us
                    respecting it we should imagine that it partook somewhat of the nature of an
                    armillary sphere, as representations of the planets were to be seen in the
                    interior of it. To these succeed a series of globes ranging from the 15th to the
                    17th century.</p>
                <p>One might suppose that many specimens of these globes would exist in public
                    libraries, but diligent research has shown that the majority of those not made
                    of metal are more perishable than maps, and much more so than books. The
                    earliest terrestrial globe of any importance known tσ geographers is the well
                    known one of Martin Behaim of Nuremberg, bearing the date of 1492. It is about
                    21 inches in diameter, and is made of pasteboard covered with parchment, on
                    which are designed historical pictures with their legends written in Old German
                    in various colours. The first meridian passes through Madeira, and the only
                    other lines on it are those of the equator, the two tropics, and the polar
                    circles. It has also a meridian of iron and an horizon of brass, but these were
                    not added until 1500, which date they bear. As a monument of geography it is of
                    the highest importance, being the only original document that has come down to
                    us in this form embodying the geographical views of its author with those of his
                    gifted contemporaries, Toscanelli, Columbus, &lt;fcc. This globe represents with
                    some slight modifications most of the disproportions of the Ptolemaic geography,
                    into which is incorporated information evidently derived from the travels of
                    Marco Polo and Sir J. Maundeville. It was executed by Behaim, assisted by
                    Holtzschuer, while on a visit to his native city (1491-3), after a sojourn of
                    five years at the Azores. It is still preserved in the house of his ancestors at
                    Nuremberg. An exact and authenticated facsimile of it, mounted on a stand, is
                    preserved in the Bib. Nat. de Paris, Section Géographique, No. 393.<note

                <p>The Laon globe of 1493, in the possession of Μ. Leonce Leroux of the
                    Administration Centrale de la Marine à Paris, is made of red copper engraved,
                    about tho size of a 36-pounder cannon ball, and pierced by a socket which at a
                    former period held an axis. It has all the appearance of having formed part of
                    the apparatus of an astronomical clock. On the globe are engraved many circles.
                    The first meridian, as in the globe of Eehaim, passes through Madeira. In the
                    northern hemisphere meridian lines are drawn at every 15th degree; these
                    meridians are again crossed by certain parallels of latitude corresponding
                    somewhat to the seven climates usually found on maps of the period. Neither
                    meridians nor parallels are to be traced on the southern hemisphere. Although
                    this globe bears a legend upon it dated 1493, it is evident that the general
                    geographical information recorded upon it is earlier than that on Behaim’s globe
                    by five or six years. In all probability it was that current in Lisbon between
                    the voyage of Diego Cam to the Zaire or Congo river, 1484-5, and that of
                    Bartholomeu Diaz to the Cape of Good Hoj e in 1487. The author is unknown. A
                    heart-shaped projection of this globe was published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bulletin</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Soc. de Geog. de Paris,</hi> 4me série,
                    tom. 20te, 1860.</p>
                <p>In all probability the earliest post-Columbian globe extant is the one now
                    preserved in the Lenox Library, New York. It was found in Paris some twenty-five
                    years ago by Mr Richard Μ. Hunt, who, upon learning its value, presented it to
                    the Lenox Library, of which he is the architect. This globe is of copper, about
                    4⅛ inches in diameter and engraved. It is pierced for an axis, and probably,
                    like the Laon sphere, formed the principal feature of an astronomical clock or
                    armillary sphere. The date assigned to the Lenox globe by Dir Henry Stevens, who
                    first recognized its importance, and had an accurately drawn projection made of
                    it in the Coast Survey Bureau at Washington in 1869, is about 1506-7. A
                    comparison of that projection, now published in reduced facsimile for the first
                    tftne (see fig. 2), with several contemporary maps and globes, serves to show
                    the accuracy of the date assigned to it, as also to suggest its French origin.
                    The author is unknown.</p>

                <p>The next globe that demands attention is the famous one made at Bamberg in 1520
                    by Johann Schöner, at the cost and charges of his friend Johann Sayler. It was
                    afterwards taken to Nuremberg by Schöner, where it is still preserved in the
                    town library. The importance attached to this globe is that hitherto it has
                    always been regarded as the first of its kind to portray the discoveries in the
                    New World, in combination with the notions that had previously prevailed of the
                    space intervening between Europe and Africa on one side, and the eastern ends of
                    Asia on the other. Schoner in this globe breaks up America into as many islands
                    as possible. Thus North America is shown as one large island. He also represents
                    South America as a large island, to which he applies several names, among which
                    we observe, for the first time on a globe, the name “America.” North America was
                    not comprised under the name until a later date. Schöner’s globe indicates two
                    great series of North American discoveries, of which one, commencing with the
                    Cabots in 1497, extended by degrees to Canada and Nova Scotia, while the other,
                    commencing with Columbus in 1492, advanced from the Bahamas slowly northwards to
                    Virginia and New England. Between these two points there remained a region more
                    or less known which on this globe is indicated by open water. In depicting the
                    east coast of Asia and the many islands there, including Japan and Java-major,
                    the author follows the globe of Behaim. By some it has been regarded as a new
                    edition of Behaim. There are in Germany several globes which depict the world
                    nearly in the same manner as Schöner’s. One, preserved in the city of Frankfort,
                    bearing the same date (1520), is about 10∣ inches in diameter, and has been
                    reproduced by M. Jomard in his <hi rend="italic">Monuments</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de la Géographie,</hi> pl. 15 and 16. There is also another in the library of
                    the grand-duke of Weimar. As all these globes give to North and South America
                    the configuration they have in Schöner, Humboldt was of opinion that they all
                    are, with respect to America, copies of an older chart “hidden perhaps in the
                    archives of Italy or Spain.”</p>
                <p>There is at Nancy a terrestrial globe which is also a geographical curiosity. It
                    is of chased silver gilt, about 6 inches in diameter; the land portions are
                    represented in fine gilding, the water by azure blue enamel. One of the
                    hemispheres opens outwards horizontally, the interior being also gilt. It
                    formerly served the purpose of a pyx on the altar of the church of Notre-Dame-de
                    Sion, to which church it was offered by Charles IV., duke of Lorraine, on his
                    return in 1663. It is now preserved in the town library. It bas all the
                    appearance of having been made at a period immediately following the execution
                    of the curious heartshaped map by Oronce Fine of 1531, found in the Paris
                    edition of Grynaeus, 1532. In this map and the globe at Nancy we find the New
                    World still regarded as an extension of eastern Asia or the Indies, the
                    geography of Marco Polo being apparently mixed up with that of Cortez in Mexico.
                    A stereographic projection of this globe was published in <hi rend="italic">Mem.
                    de la Sοc. Roy. de Nancy,</hi> vol. viii., 1836.</p>
                <p>There is another globe somewhat larger than the preceding, made of copper
                    engraved, known as the De Bure globe. It has no date, but its geographical
                    features in the main bear a close resemblance to the globe at Nancy. It is
                    supposed to be of Spanish origin. It is preserved in the Bib. Nat. de Paris,
                    Section Géographique, No. 427.</p>
                <p>In the same section, No. 394, is preserved the Ecuy globe, made of brass. The
                    word “Rhotomagi” (Rouen) is appended to the title, whence it seems to be of
                    French origin. We have on this globe the first indications of a separation
                    between East Asia and North America. The date appears to be about 1540.</p>
                <p>In 1541 the illustrious Gerard Mercator constructed and published at Louvain a
                    terrestrial globe, and in 1551 a companion celestial globe.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At a later period Mercator also made for
                    Charles V. a pair of globes, the terrestrial one of wood, the celestial one of
                    glass; these were destroyed in the subsequent troubles in the Low
                    Countries.</p></note> These are without doubt the most important monuments of
                    the kind of the 16th century. They were to be found in nearly all the
                    universities and libraries of Europe, in the private libraries of the rich, and
                    the class-room of the teacher of navigation. We also know from Blundeville’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Exercises</hi> that up to the date of 1592 they were in common use
                    in England. Six pairs at least of these globes were sold for Mercator by
                    Camerarius of Nuremberg; others we know were sold at the book-fairs of
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main; and Mercator himself presented one pair to the university
                    of Louvain, of which he was a student and a master of arts. Yet only two sets of
                    the original globes are known now to exist in Europe—one in the royal library at
                    Brussels, discovered in 1868, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n703/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0703-0682"/> other in the imperial court library at Vienna,
                    discovered in 1875. These globes are about 2 feet high, and when first mounted
                    on stands with all their accessories of meridians, horizons, &amp;c., must have
                    presented a noble appearance. They are only known to us by facsimiles of gores
                    reproduced from the originals in their natural size, published at Brussels in
                    1875, with an introduction to their history by Dr J. Van Raemdonck. A comparison
                    of the terrestrial globe with all those that preceded it shows it to be a
                    monument at once of learning and of science, worthy of the greatest scientific
                    geographer of his age.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>According to Dr F. Wieser, a third example of it is preserved at
                    Weimar.</p></note> The authors used by Mercator in his configurations of the
                    continents of the Old World were chiefly Ptolemy and Marco Polo. For
                    representing the New World he evidently acquainted himself with the narratives
                    of all the most recent voyages, maps, and charts that were to be had in his
                    time. These were used with the greatest possible skill and discrimination; and
                    in consequence we have the best delineation of the world on a globe that it was
                    possible to produce at the period. In Mercator’s time the imperfect knowledge of
                    pilots in general, and the defects of their charts in plano, made terrestrial
                    globes much more useful to navigators than we can well realize to-day. Convinced
                    of their importance Mercator neglected nothing in order to adapt them to the use
                    of seamen; he therefore added to his globes the rhumbs hitherto found only on
                    plain charts. He added yet another improvement, delineating about thirty leading
                    stars of the principal constellations according to their magnitudes and their
                    positions in the heavens. These important improvements appear to be quite
                    peculiar to the globes of Mercator.</p>
                <p>An examination of the celestial globe of 1551 also reveals many improvements
                    introduced by Mercator in his delineation of the heavens. Without counting a
                    great number of stars as yet unresolved into symbolical groups, Mercator gives
                    us 934 fixed stars, distributed in 51 constellations. Two of the latter are
                    entirely new, and are not met with on later celestial globes. These are
                    Antinous, formed of six stars on the equator below the Eagle, and Cincinnus, or
                    the Lock of Hair, formed of one star and two nebulae in the north hemisphere,
                    under the tail of the Great Bear.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    made of copper, and is divided into two hemispheres on the line of the equator,
                    and fastened together with iron pins. The normal position of the globe in its
                    stand being vertical, the north pole with its hour-circle is surmounted by an
                    iron cross. It is encompassed by a horizon, upon which are engraved the signs of
                    the zodiac. The height of the whole apparatus, with its stand of oak, is 3 feet
                    8 inches. It was executed by Euphrosynus Ulpius, a name unknown to geographers,
                    and is dedicated to Cardinal Marcellus Cervinus, D.D., who, thirteen years
                    later, was elevated to the Roman see, under the title of Marcellus II., and
                    survived his election only twenty-two days. The first meridian line passes
                    through the Canaries; the remaining ones are repeated at intervals of 30
                    degrees. Great prominence is given to the line of demarcation between Spain and
                    Portugal in the New World, laid down by Pope Alexander VI. The geographical
                    features peculiar to this globe are two, evidently copied from the Verrazano map
                    of 1529,—the legend found upon it recording the voyage made by Verrazano on
                    behalf of Francis I. in 1524, and the rude line drawn south-east from about 57°
                    to 36° N. lat. The latter, common to both map and globe, gave rise to the
                    curious conception of the “Mare Verrazano,” the origin of which has exercised
                    the minds of geographers from Hakluyt down to our day.<note anchored="true"

                    of gilt metal (it is supposed for Rudolph II.), by G. Roll and J. Reinhold at
                    Augsburg, dated 1584.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mollineux Globes of</hi> 1592.—The true successorof Mercator in
                    the art of globe-making was neither J. F. Van Langren, Jodocus Hondius, nor W.
                    J. Blaeu, as has been supposed, but an Englishman named Emerie Mollineux, the
                    friend of Hakluyt, and of John Davis of Arctic fame. The earliest notice we have
                    of the terrestrial globe made by him is the prospective one of its intended
                    publication, to be found at the end of the preface to the 1st edition of
                    Hakluyt’s <hi rend="italic">Voyages</hi> of 1589. The “comming out of the very
                    large and most exact terrestriall globe” of Mollineux there referred to, with
                    its companion celestial one, was accomplished in 1592. At the same time appeared
                    a manual in English for their use, by Thomas Hood of Trinity College, Cambridge;
                    and in 1594 appeared another manual, written expressly for them in Latin by
                    Robert Hues, entitled <hi rend="italic">Trαctatus de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Globis et eorum usu.</hi> Two years afterwards this latter was translated by J.
                    Hondius, and published in Amsterdam, giving rise to the notion, apparently still
                    prevalent in Holland, that Hues wrote this book expressly for Hondius,—a
                    bibliographical blunder involving injustice to the memory of Mollineux. The only
                    examples of these once famous globes known to exist are now preserved in the
                    library of the Middle Temple, London. They are both 2 feet in diameter, mounted
                    on stands, with the usual accessories of horizon, meridian, &lt;fcc. The
                    celestial globe still bears the date of 1592, but the terrestrial appears to
                    have received additions, and the date has been altered by the pen to 1603. The
                    best description of these two globes is a contemporary one to be found in
                    Blundeville’s <hi rend="italic">Exercises,</hi> London, 1594, which enables us
                    to realize the difference between these globes and Mercator’s :—</p>
                <p>“The mappe which covereth Mr Molineux his terrestriall globe dif-fereth greatly
                    from Mercator his terrestriall globe, by reason that there are found out divers
                    new places, as well towards the North Pole as in the East and West Indies, which
                    were unknowne to Mercator. They differ also greatly in names, longitudes,
                    latitudes, and distances of such places set down not only in Mercator’s globe
                    but also in divers maps more lately made. As touching the map of the stars which
                    covereth the celestiall globe of Mr Molineux, 1 do not find it greatly to differ
                    from that of Mercator, saving that Mr Molineux hath added to his celestiall
                    globe certain southern images, as the Crosse, &amp;c. In the great terrestriall
                    globe the voyage, as well of Sir F. Drake as of Mr Th. Candish, is set down and
                    shewed by help of two lines, the one red, and the other blew, whereof the red
                    line doth show what course Sir Francis observed in all his voyage, as well
                    outward as homeward; and the blew line showeth in like manner the voyage of
                    Master Candish, and in that globe is also set down how faire Sir Martin
                    Furbisher discovered towards the north parts. Nothing is set down in this globe
                    but only the outermost end of his voyage, named Forbisher’s Straights, having in
                    N. lat. about 63 degrees.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This last remark does not appear to be quite accurate, as John Davis
                    says:—“How far I proceeded doth appear upon the globe made by Master Emery
                    Mullineux” (Hydrographical Description, London, 1595).</p></note></p>
                <p>From a later inscription on the terrestrial globe we learn that it was still
                    further repaired in 1818 by Messrs J. &amp; W. Newton, globe makers, of Chancery
                    Lane. These globes are of special interest as the first of the kind made in
                    England and by an Englishman.</p>
                <p>In the same year J. Van Langren, and Jodocus Hondius five years later (1597), put
                    upon record their intention of bringing out pairs of globes; but no globes of
                    their <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n704/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0704-0683"/> manufacture are known to exist of a date anterior
                    to the 17th century. To Mollineux succeeds William Jansson Blaeu (1571-1638), a
                    celebrated mathematician, mapdrawer, and publisher of Amsterdam, who secured a
                    considerable reputation by publishing terrestrial and celestial globes, which
                    excelled in beauty and accuracy everything that had preceded them. He was
                    succeeded by his son John, editor of the well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atlas</hi><hi rend="italic">Majorin</hi> 11 vols, folio. The elder Blaeu
                    constructed globes in three sizes, the largest measuring 27 inches, the next
                    about 14j∙ inches, the smallest about 7 J inches in diameter. The bodies of the
                    globes were usually made of wood, covered with plastic composition upon which
                    the maps were pasted in gores, thus admitting of corrections being made from
                    time to time. In consequence of this no examples of his globes are known to
                    exist without additions of the 17th century. Mr P. J. K. Baudet, who wrote the
                    <hi rend="italic">Life and Works of W. J. Blaeu,</hi> Utrecht, 1871,
                    notwithstanding his utmost exertions, could find in Holland only two pairs, one
                    in the astronomical observatory at Leyden, the other in the physical museum at
                    Amsterdam, the latter being of the smallest size. Another pair, however, of the
                    smallest size, dated 1603, are in the possession of Mr Henry Stevens; and a pair
                    of the medium size, belonging to Mr Fred. Müller of Amsterdam, were exhibited at
                    the geographical congress held in Paris in 1875. Of the last pair, the celestial
                    globe bears the date of 1603. The terrestrial globe, though still bearing the
                    date of the first edition of 1599, has received corrections of a much later
                    date, embodying the geographical results of the first Dutch expedition to the
                    East Indies under Houtman in 1598, and those of Oliver Van Noort in the same
                    year, and of Le Maire in 1616. From a report presented to theFrench minister of
                    public instruction by Μ. E. Cortambert in 1855 we learn that a pair of fine
                    globes by Blaeu is preserved in the Bibliothèque de Bourges. Two pairs of the
                    27-inch globes of Blaeu’s heirs have recently been found, the first in the
                    library of Trinity House, Tower Hill, the second in the British Museum, of date
                    about 1645. In their main features the globes of Blaeu coincide more or less
                    with several well-known maps published at this period, and with others to be
                    found in the atlases of Mercator and Hondius.</p>
                <p>The only remaining globes of the 16th century known to us are two pairs by A. F.
                    Van Langren; the first, preserved in the Bib. Nat. de Paris, Sect. Géog., No.
                    405; the second in the Bibliothèque de Grenoble, found by Μ. E. Cortambert in
                    1855. In the latter library is also to be seen a curious terrestrial globe in
                    MS., made by some monks of the Grande Chartreuse; it is undated, but is supposed
                    to be of the 17th century.</p>
                <p>It remains to notice briefly the few globes of a later period that are remarkable
                    either for their historical interest, peculiar form, or great size. In the
                    Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg there'are or were four, that call for
                    notice. The first is a terrestrial one, 3 feet in diameter, made at Pleskow by a
                    deacon named Karpow Maximow. It is supposed to have been the first made in
                    Russia. This is accompanied by a planetary 2J feet in diameter, presented to
                    Peter the Great by the company of English merchants established in Russia. Here
                    is also preserved a large terrestrial globe of copper, made in 1664 by the heirs
                    of W. J. Blaeu; it is 7 feet in diameter, and was brought from Moscow about
                    1747. In the same academy is preserved the famous Gottorp globe; it is a hollow
                    sphere 11 feet in diameter, containing a table and seats for twelve persons. It
                    was made by A. Bush in 1654, under the direction of Olearius, from designs found
                    among the papers of Tycho Brahe, and was not finished until 1664. The outside
                    represents the terrestrial globe, the interior showing the heavens; the stars
                    are distinguished according to their respective magnitudes by gilt nails of
                    various sizes. It was presented to Peter the Great by Frederick IV. of Denmark
                    in 1713. The Czar was so pleased with his acquisition that he had it transported
                    by water to Revel, and thence on rollers and sledges to his new capital. Being
                    partly burnt in 1747, it was repaired again 1751, and adjusted to the horizon of
                    St Petersburg, the meridian and horizon being made by an English mechanic named
                    Scott.</p>
                <p>The two largest complete globes existing are those preserved in the “Salle
                    desGlobes”intheBibliothèqueNationale of Paris. They are each 12 feet in
                    diameter, and were made under the direction of the famous Italian geographer
                    Coronelli in 1683, by order of Cardinal d’Estrées, the Spanish ambassador, and
                    presented by him to Louis XIV. They are made of wood, very solid, and are
                    covered with cloth or canvas on which the configurations have been drawn by an
                    able artist, particularly those on the celestial globe. The meridians and
                    horizons are of bronze, the latter are sustained by eight columns of the same
                    material, and the former by two bronze feet highly ornamented. Between the
                    brackets that form the feet of the meridians is placed, under each globe, a
                    compass in marble and bronze; the ascent to these is by five steps which
                    encircle each globe. On the celestial globe painted blue are marked all the
                    fixed stars, and their constellations with the paths of the comets, also the
                    places of all the planets at the moment of the birth of Louis XIV. This last
                    event is alluded to also in a hyperbolical inscription to be seen on a copper
                    plate to be found on it. The geography of the terrestrial globe is based upon
                    that of Sanson; the sea being painted in deep blue, and the land portions being
                    white, the inscriptions upon it are very legible. There is also to be seen on it
                    a bust of the king placed above a dedication somewhat like that on the celestial
                    globe. Although these globes are without any great scientific value, they serve
                    to indicate the astronomical and geographical knowledge prevalent in France at
                    the end of the 17th century. A good illustration of these globes, accompanied by
                    a detailed account of their history, by M. C. Letort of the Bibliothèque
                    Nationale, will be found in <hi rend="italic">La Nature,</hi> No. 116, August
                    21, 1875. In the Bib. Mazarine is preserved a terrestrial globe 8 feet in
                    diameter, known as the Louis XVI. globe. It is made of copper engraved, the
                    names of places being inlaid with black, and is mounted on a temporary wooden
                    structure, the beautiful accessories of bronze cast for it never having been
                    finished or utilized; they are, however, to be seen in another part of the
                    library. We learn from a MS. description of this globe, also preserved here,
                    that it was made for Louis XVI., himself no mean geographer, by the direction of
                    Vergennes in 1784. The geography of it is based upon that of D’Anville,
                    corrected by Robert de Vaugondy and Le Clerc; it also indicates the net results
                    of all the voyages round the world made up to this period.</p>
                <p>About 1764 Dr Roger Long of Cambridge, professor of astronomy and master of
                    Pembroke, erected in an outbuilding of his hall a sphere 18 feet in diameter.
                    The concave interior was lined with tin, upon which was depicted all the stars
                    and constellations visible in England on the horizon of Cambridge. The lower
                    part of the sphere was cut off at the diameter of 13 feet, and the truncated
                    meridians were screwed down on to a circle which ran on rollers of lignum vitae,
                    the whole being movable by simple machinery provided for the purpose. It was
                    capable of holding thirty persons, and had an entrance by six steps placed over
                    the South Pole. In the centre was placed a planetarium. Although it is said
                    funds were left for its preservation, it appears to have fallen into neglect and
                    decay.</p>
                <p>To these succeed in order of size the globes known as “Georamas.” One exhibited
                    in Paris in 1844 was 30 feet in diameter; another by Delanhard erected in 1823
                    was 40 feet in diameter; of the last the proprietor published a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n705/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0705-0684"/> description. Then follows Wyld’s well known
                    “great globe,” erected in Leicester Square, London, 60 feet in diameter. The
                    largest appears to have been the one erected by Colonel Langlois in Paris in
                    1825, on the Champs Elysées. This was 120 feet in diameter. As has been truly
                    said, these structures served more to satisfy curiosity than to impart
                    scientific instruction, (c. <hi rend="smallcaps">h. c.)</hi></p>
                <p>Manufacture.—The manufacture of artificial globes has changed but little in
                    character during the last hundred years. Such improvements as have been
                    introduced have reference eitheι∙ to the quality of the maps or to the mode of
                    mounting the globes. The number of sizes manufactured has also been increased.
                    The diameter has always been used to indicate the size of the globes, and those
                    now produced by the various makers vary from 1 to 36 inches.</p>
                <p>The process of manufacture differs little if at all in the sizes of globes
                    ranging between 3 and 25 inches. Thus supposing, for example, a 12-inch globe
                    (the ordinary school globe) is required to be made, a spherical mould measuring
                    some quarter of an inch less in diameter is prepared on which to form
                    hemispherical caps that are to constitute a hollow foundation for the globe.
                    This mould, made preferably hollow for lightness, and having a central axle
                    terminating in poles, is well greased on the surface to enable it to resist
                    damp. To form the caps, strips of white paper, damped in water, are first
                    applied to the mould to form a coating thereon. Upon this coating is applied
                    brown paper saturated with paste, and alternate layers of white and brown paper
                    are added, until the required thickness of paper, say <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅛th of an inch, is obtained. The change of colour is adopted simply as a
                    guide to the workman, that he may know when he has completed a coating of paper.
                    The mould thus covered is put aside to dry, and after two or three days the
                    paper covering is severed into two hemispherical caps, which are then drawn off
                    from the mould.</p>
                <p>A wooden axle furnished with poles (which will eventually form the north and
                    south poles of the globe) is provided, of such a length as will euable the caps,
                    when fitted over the poles, to meet at their severed edges. By means of glue
                    these edges are joined up, and the caps are firmly attached to the ends of the
                    axle. Thus a hollow sphere of rude outline is formed, measuring somewhat less
                    than 12 inches in diameter. The next operation is to bring this sphere to the
                    required diameter for the globe, and to make it perfectly true. For this purpose
                    the ball is coated with a plastic composition of whiting, boiled oil, and glue,
                    and passed under the action of a steel semicircle fitted with bearings for
                    receiving the poles of the ball, and retaining the same in place while the ball
                    is being slowly rotated. By applying to the ball repeated coatings of this
                    composition, and removing all superfluities by means of the gauging edge of this
                    steel semicircle, a smooth spherical surface is eventually obtained. When the
                    ball is finished and hard, it is tested in loose bearings to see whether it will
                    remain quiescent in all positions. If it shows a tendency to run round, the ball
                    is balanced by the introduction of a counterweight at the highest part of its
                    periphery. When the ball is balanced, and the hole made good by which the
                    counterweight was introduced, the surface is polished, after which it is ready
                    to receive the map. For 12-inch globes the maps of the earth and of the heavens
                    are engraved on steel or copper plates in 12 gores, measuring each 30 degrees in
                    width, and extending from pole to pole, or more usually to the 7θth degree of
                    latitude, the remaining portion of the maps being made up by north and south
                    pole plates. This arrangement is somewhat modified for larger globes. Thus, for
                    globes above 15 inches in diameter, the gores are divided in the line of the
                    equator, and they are also divided longitudinally for say one-fourth of their
                    length at the 15th degree, in order to facilitate the laying down of the maps
                    evenly upon the spherical surface. Preparatory to covering the sphere with the
                    map, it is marked with lines corresponding to the equator, parallels of
                    latitude, and lines of longitude on the map, such lines serving as a guide for
                    the workman; The gores of the map having been carefully cut out, they are damped
                    and laid down in proper order in a pile upon a pasting board. The workman then
                    covers his polished ball, for the length and breadth of a gore, with paste, or,
                    more properly, a preparation of starch, and having coated with starch the
                    uppermost gore of the pile, he with an ivory knife lifts that gore, and lays it
                    upon the pasted portion of the ball, fitting it to the lines marked thereon, and
                    smoothing down creases, at the same time taking care that the latitude and
                    longitude lines of the gore correspond exactly with the lines on the ball.
                    Having laid down this gore in place, he next applies a second gore in like
                    manner, taking care that the two gores shall join each other, and not expose any
                    portion of the underlying surface. In this way the workman proceeds until all
                    the gores are in place, and he finishes the pasting of the ball by applying the
                    pole papers which fit respectively on to the opposite ends of the gores. The map
                    has next to be sized, preparatory to its being coloured, in order to form a
                    resist to the varnish which is subsequently to be applied to the globe. The map
                    is tinted and outlined with water colours, and a coat of varnish is then
                    applied. When this is dry the globe is ready for mounting; after which the
                    varnishing operation is completed by the application in a heated room ol several
                    coats of spirit varnish following quickly the one on the other. Some skill is
                    requisite in laying on the varnish, so as to obtain a surface as clear and
                    smooth as glass. This result is unfortunately evanescent, as the best varnish is
                    liable to discolour and to crack, and thereby obscure to some extent the
                    legibility of the underlying map. After varnishing the globe will be fit to
                    handle in from four to six days. For the purpose of mounting the globe a flat
                    ring, termed the brazen meridian, is provided, and bearings are formed thereon
                    to receive the poles of the globe. This ring is divided on its face into 360
                    degrees, the numbering of these degrees being from 0 (which corresponds with the
                    equator) to 90 at the poles on one half of the ring, and on the other half the
                    numbering starts from the poles at 0, running up to 90, which corresponds with
                    the equator. Fitted to the poles, and capable of turning thereon, are hour
                    circles, which underlie the brazen meridian, and are divided and numbered to
                    correspond with the 24 hours of the day and night. The frame for the reception
                    of the globe and ring is formed with a wooden horizon, which constitutes an
                    imaginary line dividing the globe into two equal parts, the portion above the
                    horizon being the visible half, and that below the horizon the invisible half of
                    the sphere. This horizon is covered, like the globe, with papers which are
                    varnished to protect them from injury. The horizon papers near their inner edge
                    are divided into 360 degrees, by which arc reckoned the azimuth and the
                    amplitude; they also indicate the points of the compass in the space called the
                    circle of the winds. The horizon of the frame is notched to receive the brass
                    meridian, which rests in a step-bearing fitted to the central pillar or block of
                    the frame, and is held therein by a screw stop, which, entering an annular
                    groove iu the back of the meridian, leaves the ring free to turn round in the
                    frame, for the purpose of rectifyingthe globe, or bringing its axis to any
                    desired angle with the horizon. The fitting of the globe is completed by the
                    quadrant of altitude, consisting of a thin flexible slip of brass, jointed to a
                    clamping nut, which is intended to embrace the brass meridian, and may be
                    adjusted thereon by a tightening screw. This flexible strip or blade is divided
                    off into 90 degrees, corresponding to those on the equator, and is intended to
                    measure distances between any <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> two places upon the
                    curved surface of the earth, or the altitude of the sun, a star, or any
                    planetary body in the heavens, and for this purpose its graduations are numbered
                    from 0 to 90. A useful appendage to the globe frame is a mariner’s compass,
                    which facilitates the adjustment of the globes to their true polar position.</p>
                <p>The value of a globe, whether terrestrial or celestial, depends mainly on the
                    quality of the map with ’ whieh it is covered. Before the present century,
                    English globes were not only poor specimens of the engraver's art, but they
                    showed little attention to accuracy of detail. Now, however, they rank in
                    quality with, if they do not surpass, the best foreign maps, notwithstanding
                    that little encouragement is given to their manufacture. Specimens of globe
                    plates published at the latter end of the 17th century in Italy are yet to be
                    seen, which are a marvel of the cosmographer’s art. Under the patronage of the
                    Venetian republic, P. Coronelli, cosmographer to the republic, published a
                    terrestrial and celestial globe of the unprecedented size of 4 feet in diameter,
                    which embodied the utmost scientific knowledge of the time, and in the
                    constellations of the celestial globe showed the finest quality of line
                    engraving at its best period. The composition of these figures served as a basis
                    for the remodelling of the constellations on English globes some 40 years since,
                    at which time the drawing of the figures was not metely barbarous, but absurd.
                    Whether these fine globes were ever manufactured it is now difficult to
                    ascertain, but none are known to exist except a celestial globe produced by the
                    late Mr William Newton, to whom the globe manufacture is indebted for such
                    improvements as have been introduced during the present century, and another
                    which is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, bearing the name of
                    Deuvez as the maker. .</p>
                <p>An amusing illustration of the difficulties which attend the delineator of globe
                    plates is to be found in the pieface of a book published in 1686, for its
                    author, Mr J. Moxon, entitled A Tutor to Astronomy and Geography. Moxon appears
                    to have been a globe-maker, and in expatiating on the improvements to be found
                    in his new terrestrial globe, he says:—“California is found to be an island,
                    though formerly supposed to be part of the main continent, whose north-west
                    shore was imagined to thrust itself forth close to the coasts of Cathaio, and so
                    make the supposed straits of Anian.” On his globe, therefore, the peninsula was
                    converted into an island. Precisely the same difficulties are now experienced by
                    globe-makers; and those who have watched, for example, the varied forms which
                    the lakes in Central Africa have taken during the last 25 years will understand
                    at what risk the globe-maker corrects his costly plates, to bring them up to the
                    current geographical knowledge.</p>
                <p>The inconvenience attendant on the transport of large globes, manufactured as
                    above explained, not to speak of their excessive cost, led to the introduction
                    of flexible or compressible globes, both</p>
