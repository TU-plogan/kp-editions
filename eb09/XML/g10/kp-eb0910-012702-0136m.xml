                    (1737-1802), a learned theologian, biblical critic, and miscellaneous writer,
                    was born at the farm of Arradoul, in the parish of Rathven, Banffshire,
                    Scotland, on the 14th of September 1737. At the age of fourteen he entered the
                    small Roman Catholic seminary at Scalan in a remote glen of the Banffshire
                    highlands, where he remained till October 1758, when he was sent to the Scottish
                    College in Paris for the further prosecution of his studies. Here to
                    considerable acquirements in biblical philology and school divinity he succeeded
                    in adding a good knowledge of most of the literary languages of Europe.
                    Returniug to Scotland after an absence of six years, he for a short time
                    officiated as a priest in Dundee, but in May 1765 received and accepted an
                    invitation to become resident in the family of the earl of Traquair, where, with
                    abundance of leisure and the free use of an adequate library, he made further
                    progress in his favourite biblical studies. After a second visit to Paris which
                    extended over some months, and which was employed by him in reading and making
                    extracts from rare books and manuscripts in the public libraries, he in 1769 was
                    appointed to the charge of the Catholic congregation of Auchinhalrig in his
                    native county. During the period of a ten years’ incumbency there he displayed a
                    liberality of spirit which caused considerable scandal to his stricter brethren;
                    and the freedom with which he fraternized with his Protestant neighbours once
                    and again called forth the rebuke of his bishop (Hay). Ultimately, on account of
                    his occasional attendance at the parish church of Cullen, where his friend
                    Buchanan was minister, he was deprived of his charge and forbidden the exercise
                    of ecclesiastical functions within the diocese. This happened in 1779; and in
                    1780 he went with his friend Lord Traquair to London, where he spent the rest of
                    his life, with the exception of a few weeks devoted to travel on the Continent.
                    Before leaving Scotland he had received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the
                    university of Aberdeen, a compliment seldom before paid to any Catholic, and had
                    been made an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries, in the institution
                    of which he had taken a very active part. Shortly after his arrival in London
                    Geddes received an appointment in connexion with the chapel of the imperial
                    ambassador, which he held until the chaplaincy was suppressed some years
                    afterwards. Having been introduced to Lord Petre, to whom he broached his
                    long-cherished scheme for the publication of a new Catholic version of the
                    Scriptures on the basis of the Vulgate, he met with every encouragement from
                    that nobleman, who assigned to him an annual salary of £200, and, moreover,
                    undertook to provide the needful books. Supported also by such scholars as
                    Kennicott and Lowth, Geddes in 1786 published <hi rend="italic">&amp; Prospectus
                    of a new Translation of the Holy Bible, from corrected Texts of the Originals,
                    compared with the ancient Versions, with various Headings, explanatory Notes,
                    and critical Observations,</hi> a considerable quarto volume, in which the
                    defects of previous translations were fully pointed out, and the means were
                    indicated by which these might be removed. It attracted considerable notice of a
                    favourable kind, and led to the publication in 1788 of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proposals for Printing,</hi> with a specimen, and in 1790 of a <hi
                    rend="italic">General Answer to Queries, Counsels, and Criticisms.</hi> The
                    first volume of the translation itself, which was entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Holy Bible; or the Books accounted sacred by Jews and Christians; otherwise
                    called the Books of the Old and New Covenants; faithfully translated from
                    corrected Texts of the Originals, with various Readings, explanatory Notes, and
                    critical Remarks,</hi> appeared in 1792, and was the signal for a storm of
                    hostility on the part of both Catholics and Protestants. It was obvious
                    enough—no small offence inthe eyes of some—that as a critic Geddes had
                    identified himself with Houbigant, Kennicott, and Michaelis; but others did not
                    hesitate to stigmatize him as the would-be “corrector of the Holy Ghost.” Three
                    of the vicars-apostolic almost immediately warned all the faithful against the
                    “use and reception” of his translation, on the ostensible ground that it had not
                    been examined and approved by due ecclesiastical authority; and by his own
                    bishop (Douglas) he was in 1793 suspended from the exercise of his orders in the
                    London district. The second volume of the translation, completing the historical
                    books, published in 1797, found no more friendly reception; but this
                    circumstance did not discourage him from giving forth in 1800 the volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Critical Remarks on the Hebrew Scriptures, corresponding with a
                    New Translation of the Bible, containing the Pentateuch,</hi> of which it is
                    enough to say that, while fully saturated with all the best learning of its
                    time, it presented in a somewhat brusque and injudicious manner the then novel
                    and startling views of Eichhorn and his school on the primitive history and
                    early records of mankind. Dr Geddes was engaged on a critical translation of the
                    Psalms, which he had completed down to the 118th, when he was seized with a
                    lingering and painful illness which ultimately proved fatal on the 26 th of
                    February 1802. Although for many years he had been under ecclesiastical
                    censures, he had never for a moment swerved from a consistent profession of
                    faith as a Catholic; and on his death-bed he duly received the last rites of his
                    communion. It would appear, however, that the report which gained currency that
                    before his death he had made recantation of his “errors” was entirely destitute
                    of foundation in fact. In his lifetime he enjoyed the friendship of several
                    eminent Continental scholars, and his death was noticed as being a loss to
                    science in the <hi rend="italic">Gelehrte Zeitung</hi> of Gotha and in other
                    foreign journals.</p>
