                    Gabâo</hi></label>, called Olo’ Mpongwe by the Mpongwe natives, and Aboka by the
                    Fan, is, in reality, not a river but an estuary on the west coast of Africa. It
                    lies immediately north of the equator, disemboguing in 0° 21' 25" N. lat. and 9°
                    21' 23" W. long. At the entrance, between Cape Joinville, or Santa Clara, on the
                    N., and Cape Pangara, or Sandy Point, on the S., it has a width of about 18
                    English miles. It maintains a breadth of about 7 miles for a distance of 40
                    miles inland, when it contracts into what is known more correctly as the Rio
                    Olambo, which is not more than 2 or 3 miles from bank to bank. Two rivers, the
                    Nkomo or Como and the Mbokwa or Bokoe, discharge into the upper portion of the
                    Rio Olambo, both taking their rise in the country of the Sierra dal Crystal. The
                    former, which far exceeds the other in the length of its course, has its head
                    waters, according to M. Genoyer (1862), in that part of the range which is known
                    to the natives as Anenguenpala, or the “Water-jug.” Mr Winwood Reade reached the
                    rapids in 1862, and Mr R. B. N. Walker, one of the traders in the Gaboon, has
                    ascended for about 30 miles up the river, which had still 2 fathoms of water.
                    Captain Burton, who in 1870 sailed up the Mbokwa as far as Tippet Town or
                    Mayyan, a little way beyond the confluence of the Londo, found it there “some 50
                    feet broad,” with a tidal rise of nearly 7 feet·. There are a great number of
                    other streams that fall into the Gaboon, but only two are worthy of special
                    mention,—the Remboa, which, rising like the Nkomo and Mbokwa in the Sierra dal
                    Crystal, enters the estuary at its south-east corner, and the Eko or Cohit,
                    which is the largest of the right hand affluents, Though the whole estuary is
                    studded with islands, reefs, and shoals, none of the islands are of great extent
                    except Coniquet, or King’s Isle, at the mouth of the Cohit, and Embeneh, or
                    Parrot Island, in the middle of the channel.</p>
                <p>The four principal tribes in the country of the Gaboon are the Mpongwa, the Fan,
                    the Bakalai, and the Boulous. The first of these tribes, usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">Gαbοηs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gabonese</hi> by French writers,
                    is distributed along both banks of the “river,” occupying the villages of
                    Kringer, Quaben, Louis, Libreville, and Glass on the ri"ht side, and those of
                    George Town and Denis on the left. According to Captain Burton, they are now one
                    of the most civilized of African tribes, displaying a keen interest in trade,
                    and great ease and urbanity of manner. There are three grades or quasi-castes
                    among them—1st, those of pure blood, who rejoice in the title of 0ngwa Ntye or
                    “sons of the soil”; 2d, the children of freemen by slaves; and, 3d, the slaves
                    themselves. Marriage is by purchase, and polygamy is the rule, but the women
                    hold a position of considerable social influence, and maintain a secret society
                    of their own. The men are excellent makers of canoes, and, within the present
                    generation, they have learned to build boats of considerable size after the
                    European model. From childhood both sexes are habitual smokers of tobacco or
                    hemp—the tobacco being imported from America, although it might be readily
                    cultivated in the country. A baptismal rite, almost identical with the Christian
                    ceremony, is administered to the new-born child. The language of the Mpongwa has
                    been reduced to writing by the American missionaries. As early as 1847 they
                    published a grammar and vocabulary at New York; and in 1859 the American Bible
                    Society brought out a Mpongwa translation of the books of Proverbs, Genesis,
                    part of Exodus, and the Acts. The language belongs to the same family as the
                    Sechwana, the Zulu, &amp;c., and is characterized, says Captain Burton, by
                    inflexion, by systematic prefixes, a complex alliteration, and the almost
                    unparalleled flexibility of the verb, which can be modified in several hundred
                    different ways. Μ. Oatteloup describes it as “riche, criard, imagé, et
                    complique.” It has been adopted by the Pahouins, the Bakalai, and the Boulous as
                    a kind of commercial <hi rend="italic">lingua franca,</hi> and bids fair to
                    become the dominant language of the coast, if it does not give way before
                    English or French, which have both become familiar in a corrupted form to a
                    large number of the maritime population.</p>
                <p>The Fan, whose name appears under the various forms of Fanwe, Panwe, Phaouin, and
                    Paouen, are new comers to the Gaboon district, having, it is said, appeared
                    there for the first time in 1842. They are described as of mean height,
                    chocolate complexion, and remarkably regular features. Their reputation as
                    cannibals is evidently well founded; but they seem to partake of human flesh
                    rather as a ceremonial observance than as an ordinary means of nourishment, and
                    both Winwood Reade and Captain Burton speak in favourable terms of their general
                    characteristics. They are skilful workers in iron, and, manufacture cross-bows
                    which discharge poisoned darts 40 or 50 yards. Tattooing is practised by both
                    sexes, and the women often stain the whole body red or yellow. The tribe has
                    come very little into contact with Europeans, but it is moving towards the
                    coast, and will probably before long be the dominant race in the Gaboon.</p>
                <p>The Gaboon was early visited by the Portuguese explorers, and it became one of
                    the chief seats of the slave trade. It was not, however, till well on in the
                    present century that Europeans made any more permanent settlement than was
                    absolutely necessary for the maintenance of their commerce. In 1839 Captain
                    Bouet of the “Malouine” obtained for France the right of residence on the left
                    bank, and in 1842 he secured better positions at Louis and Quaben on the right
                    bank. The chief establishment, called Le Plateau, at Libreville, was founded in
                    1845, and gradually acquired considerable importance. In 1867 the troops
                    numbered about 1000, and the civil population about 5000, while the official
                    reports about the same date claimed for the whole colony an area of 8000 square
                    miles, and a population of 186,000. A large building with arcades at Libreville
                    served as Government house, and there were pretty extensive warehouses, a
                    hospital, and a small dockyard, as well as gardens, and a nursery for coffee
                    plants and fruit trees. At some little distance off a convent was founded in
                    1844 by Mgr. Bessieux. In consequence of the waι∙ with Germany the colony was
                    practically abandoned in 1871, and the establishment at Libreville is now
                    maintained only as a coaling dépôt. There are numerous English trading ports
                    along the shores of the estuary, as at Glass Town and Olemi; and even when the
                    French influence was at its greatest almost the whole commerce of the Gaboon was
                    in English hands. The chief articles of export are ivory and beeswax; to which
                    may be added caoutchouc, ebony, and camwood. Mission stations are maintained by
                    French, English, American, German, and Portuguese societies.</p>
