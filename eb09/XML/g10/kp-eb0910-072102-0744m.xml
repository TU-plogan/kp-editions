                <p><label type="entry">GOETHE</label></p>
                <p>JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE (1749-1832) was born in Frankfort on August 28, 1749.
                    His parents were citizens of that imperial town, and Wolfgang was their only son
                    and their eldest child. His father was born on July 31, 1710, and in 1742
                    received the title of imperial councillor. He married on August 20, 1748, at the
                    age of thirty-eight, Catherine Elizabeth Textor, a girl of seventeen. Her family
                    was better than his own, and held a higher position in the town. Her father was
                    imperial councillor, and had been Schultheiss or chief magistrate. In December
                    1750 was born a daughter, Cornelia, who remained until her death, at the age of
                    twenty-seven, her brother’s most intimate friend. She was married in 1773 to
                    John George Schlosser. The house in which Goethe was born is still to be seen in
                    the Hirschgraben. Goethe has described to us how it was rebuilt, and it has
                    since been much altered. His education was irregular; he went to no school, and
                    his father rather stimulated than instructed him. But the atmosphere by which he
                    was surrounded gave him, perhaps, the best education he could have received.
                    Frankfort, a free town of the empire, still preserved the appearance of the
                    Middle Ages. It had lost the reality of power, but its citizens naturally grew
                    up with a strong sense of independence, and a power of realizing the unity of
                    Germany which was wanting in a small state. The boy from his earliest youth was
                    accustomed to the companionship of his elders. His father was strict and formal,
                    his mother quick and lively, inspired with no small share of the genius of her
                    son. Goethe lived in the freest intercourse with every kind of society in the
                    town, in which he might expect some day to be an important personage. There was
                    no capital like London or Paris to call him away; Berlin was poor and distant,
                    Vienna half Italian and half Spanish. Goethe must have been brought up with the
                    ambition to take his degree at the university as doctor, to return home and
                    become an advocate, to make a rich marriage, to go through the regular course of
                    civil offices, to inherit his father’s house, and perhaps one day to be
                    burgomaster. His home was a cultivated one. The father was fond of art and of
                    the German poetry <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n745/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0745-0722"/> then iu fashion. The influence of Lessing had
                    scarcely made itself felt; Herder was only five years older than Goethe himself.
                    Gellert and Gottsched were the two oracles of poetry,—Gottsched a pedantic
                    product of the earlier French culture, Gellert old and immovable, and unable to
                    comprehend the new spirit. The chief debt that Goethe owed to him was the
                    improvement in his handwriting, on which Gellert laid great stress, and which he
                    coupled with moral excellence. Goethe’s father had a great respect for these
                    rhyming poets, and he so strongly objected to the new German hexameters that
                    Wolfgang could only read Klopstock’s <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> with his
                    sister in the greatest secrecy and in terror of discovery. He did, however, read
                    it, and learned much of it by heart. French culture gave at this time the
                    prevailing tone to Europe. Goethe could not have escaped its influence, and he
                    was destined to fall under it in a special manner. In the Seven Years’ War,
                    which was now raging, France took the side of the empire against Frederick the
                    Great. Frankfort was full of French soldiers, and a certain Comte Thorane, who
                    was quartered in Goethe’s house, had an important influence on the boy. Still
                    more strongly was he affected by the French company of actors, whom he came to
                    know both on and off the stage. He learned to declaim in this manner passages of
                    Racine without understanding a word of them. At a later period he knew French
                    thoroughly well, and composed both prose and poetry in that language. His first
                    writings were imitations of the French manner; his earliest play was the
                    imitation of a French after-piece. We can understand how these different forces
                    were to work upon his future life. From his father he derived the steadfastness
                    of character which enabled him to pursue an independent career of self-culture
                    and devotion to art in the midst of every kind of distracting influence; from
                    his mother he inherited the joyous nature and lively sympathy, the flow of
                    language and love of narration, w ithout which he could not have been a poet.
                    Before the age of sixteen he had seen every kind of life in a city particularly
                    favourable to a richness of individual character; he w as entirely free from the
                    prejudices of a small state; and as far as he cared for Germany he cared for it
                    as a whole. He was tinged at an early age w ith the influence of the clearest
                    and most finished language in Europe, and this influence, uniting with the
                    natural clearness of Goethe’s mind, made his prose a new phenomenon in the
                    literature of his country, unlike anything which had been seen before. Lastly,
                    with the most passionate aspirations for freedom and independence of life, he
                    was born into the slavery of a mechanical career of prosaic prosperity, the
                    pressure of which was not strong enough to confine him, but was strong enough to
                    stimulate all his efforts to break the bonds.</p>
                <p>Goethe, if w e may believe his autobiography, experienced his first love about
                    the age of fifteen in the person of Gretchen, whom some have supposed to be the
                    daughter of an innkeeper at Offenbach. He worshipped her as Dante worshipped
                    Beatrice. She treated him as a child, much as Miss Chaworth treated Byron. But
                    there is no other evidence of this first love, and it would be quite in
                    accordance with Goethe’s manner to enlarge on a very small foundation, or to
                    concentrate on one person the feelings which w ere devoted to several
                    individuals. His letters speak of a boyish love for one Charitas Meixner, a
                    friend of his sister, two years younger than himself, the daughter of a rich
                    merchant at Worms. He expresses his affection for her with all the fervour of
                    French phraseology, and the passion did not leave him when he had removed to
                    Leipsic. But Charitas was able to console herself with another engagement. She
                    married in February 1773 a merchant of her native town, and died at the end of
                    the following year.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1765 Goethe, w ho had just completed his sixteenth year,
                    travelled to Leipsic in the company of a bookseller, Fleischer, and his wife,
                    who were on their way to attend the fair. On the 19th of October he was admitted
                    as a student of the Bavarian nation, one of the four into which the university
                    was divided. For his lodging he had two neat little rooms in the Feuerkugel, the
                    Fire Ball, looking into the long court-yard which leads from the old market to
                    the new. When we remember that his three years at Leipsic, about which so much
                    has been written, correspond with the last three years of an English boy at a
                    public school, we can form some idea of the singular individuality of his
                    character and the maturity and ripeness of his genius. He was sent to Leipsic to
                    study law, in order that he might return to Frankfort fitted for the regular
                    course of municipal distinction. For this purpose he carried with him a letter
                    to Professor Böhme, who taught history and imperial law in the university, but
                    had no other distinction to recommend him. He told Professor Böhme that he
                    intended to devote himself not to law but to belles lettres, or, to use the w
                    0rd which F. A. Wolf had invented, philology. Böhme did his best to dissuade
                    him, and in this was assisted by his wife. The effect of their advice was rather
                    to disgust Goethe with modern German literature, to make him despise what he had
                    already written, and to drive him into the distractions of society, which wasted
                    both his time and his money. He did, however, attend some lectures. He heard
                    Ernesti on Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Orator,</hi> but he dealt rather with
                    questions of grammar than of taste. He attended Gellert’s lectures on
                    literature, and even joined his private class. Gellert held a high position
                    among German men of letters, which was due quite as much to his character as to
                    his genius. He advised Goethe to desert poetry for prose, and to take to
                    authorship only as an employment subordinate to the serious occupations of his
                    life. Goethe tells us that in his lectures upon taste he never heard Gellert
                    mention the names of Klopstock, Kleist, Wieland, Gessner, Gleim, or Lessing. He
                    also attended the lectures of another literary professor, Clodius, a young man
                    about ten years older than himself. Clodius corrected Goethe’s writings with red
                    ink, and pointed out the faults without showing the way to mend them, Goethe had
                    written a poem of congratulation for the marriage of his uncle Textor (February
                    17, 1766), w hich, according to the fashion of the time, was full of gods and
                    goddesses and other mythological apparatus. Clodius was unsparingly hard upon
                    this production, and Goethe then perceived that his critic was just as faulty as
                    himself in the use of abstractions and strange outlandish words to give weight
                    and authority to his verse. He satirized Clodius in a poem in praise of the
                    cakes of the confectioner Händel, and by a parody of his drama <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medon.</hi> His position towards thθ professors of his university was not an
                    enviable one. His real university education was derived from intercourse with
                    his friends. First among these w as J. G. Schlosser, who afterw ards married his
                    sister. Goethe used to dine with him at a table d’hote kept by a wine-dealer,
                    Schönkopf, in the Bruhl (No. 79), in a house which still exists. Schlosser, who
                    was at this time private secretary to the duke of Wiirtemberg and tutor to his
                    children, was ten years older than Goethe. He had a great influence upon him,
                    chiefly in introducing him to a wider circle of German, French, English, and
                    Italian poetry. At the table of Professor Ludwig, where Goethe had previously
                    dined, the conversation had generally turned on medical and scientific subjects.
                    Another friend of Goethe’s was Behrisch, tutor to the young Count Lindenau. He w
                    as a man in middle life, and he combined originality of character and clearness
                    of literary judgment with a dry and caustic wit, and an ever-abiding sense of
                    humour, much in the same proportions as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n746/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0746-0723"/> were found in Merck, who exercised at a later
                    period an important influence over Goethe’s career. His friendship with Goethe
                    was not at first of advantage to him. He was deprived of his tutorship from a
                    suspicion that he did not always keep the most select society, and his successor
                    was forbidden to allow his charge to associate with the young poet. This is
                    supposed to have been caused by Goethe’s disrespectful behaviour to Professor
                    Clodius. Gellert obtained for Behrisch an educational post at the court of
                    Dessau, and Goethe kept up a constant correspondence with him till his death in
                    1809. Behrisch would not allow Goethe to print his poems, but copied them out
                    instead in a beautiful hand. He probably had a considerable effect in producing
                    the simplicity and naturalness of Goethe’s early style.</p>
                <p>But the person who had the strongest effect on Goethe’s mental development was
                    Adam Frederick Oeser, at this time director of the academy of arts in Leipsic.
                    Goethe took lessons from him in drawing, and, not content with this, tried his
                    hand at etching. A little device of his for a book-plate or a bill-head is
                    extant, in which a slab with the name C. G. Schönkopf is represented with three
                    bottles above and a wreath of flowers below. Oeser had been afriendof
                    Winckelmann’s, and exercised great influence over his views of art. This was a
                    source of considerable reputation to him, and Winckelmann’s tragic death, the
                    news of which reached Leipsic whilst Goethe was there, must have brought the
                    relation between them into stronger relief. Goethe always spoke of Oeser’s
                    influence with the greatest affection and respect. He writes—“Oeser’s
                    discoveries have given me a fresh opportunity of blessing myself that I had him
                    for my instructor. He entered into our very souls, and we must indeed have been
                    without souls not to have derived benefit from him. His lessons will produce
                    their effects through all the rest of my existence. He taught me that the ideal
                    of beauty is simplicity and repose.” ΛVe find Goethe at Weimar continually
                    consulting Oeser for designs for furniture and for theatrical
                    entertainments.</p>
                <p>Goethe from his earliest years was never without a passion, and at Leipsic his
                    passion was Kitty Schönkopf, the Aennchen of the autobiography, the daughter of
                    the host at whose house he dined. She often teased him with her inconstant ways,
                    and to this experience is due his first drama <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Laune des Verliebten,</hi> “Lovers’ Quarrels,” as it may be
                    styled. It is a mere trifle, a pastoral in one act, written in alexandrines in
                    the French style. Two happy and two unhappy lovers are contrasted. The only
                    interest of the piece is that it is a fragment from Goethe’s own life. A deeper
                    chord is struck in <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mitschuldigen</hi> (The Fellow Sinners), which forms a dismal and forbidding
                    picture both of the time and of the experiences of the youth who wrote it. The
                    daughter of an innkeeper has made an unhappy marriage, and is visited by a
                    former lover who is in good circumstances. An assignation is arranged, and the
                    interview is witnessed by the husband, who has come to steal the stranger’s
                    purse. The father comes in to read one of the stranger’s letters. He is
                    surprised, and is with his daughter suspected of the theft. The real culprit is
                    discovered, but defends himself by accusing the stranger of his conduct to his
                    wife. So they are all guilty. This play was first written in one act. It was
                    afterwards enlarged to three acts, and published in 1787. The manuscript, which
                    still exists, was given to Frederike Brion of Sesenheim. Besides these plays
                    Goethe wrote at Leipsic twenty little songs of an erotic chararacter, which were
                    set to music by his young friend Breitkopf. He describes them as moral-sensuous,
                    but they are more sensuous than moral. They have the merit of a musical easy
                    flow of expression, various moods of passion, with a happy readiness and
                    elegance. Only a few of them were included in his collected works, and those
                    very much altered. They show the influence of Wieland, but by one side of
                    Wieland Goethe was never affected. He was never led to mingle classical ideas
                    and emblems with the unrestrained and sensual frivolity which was disseminated
                    from France. He never imitated Agathon or Musarion. Whatever may have been the
                    bitterness of his experience of life, or the waywardness of his excited fancy,
                    he conceived a true idea of the real nature of classical art. In this
                    Winckelmann and Lessing were his teachers, and he was never untrue to the
                    lessons which they inculcated. This was the most valuable possession he brought
                    back from Leipsic. He had an opportunity of establishing his principles of taste
                    during a short visit to Dresden, in which he devoted himself to the pictures and
                    the antiques. The end of Goethe’s stay at Leipsic was saddened by illness. One
                    morning at the beginning of the summer he was awakened by a violent hemorrhage.
                    For several days he hung between life and death, and after that his recovery was
                    slow, although he was tended with the greatest anxiety by his friends. He
                    finally left Leipsic far from well on August 28, 1768, his nineteenth
                    birthday.</p>
                <p>Goethe made an enforced stay of a year and a half in his native town. It was
                    perhaps the least happy part of his life. He was in bad health. His cure
                    proceeded slowly, and he had several relapses, and the weakness of the lungs,
                    which was his first complaint, was succeeded by a weakness of the digestion,
                    which was yet more troublesome and painful. The society of Frankfort seemed to
                    him far less agreeable than that of Leipsic; he contrasted the cold, stiff,
                    formal, old-fashioned life of the imperial city with the freshness, geniality,
                    and intellectual activity of the Saxon university. His family relations were not
                    pleasant. His grandfather Textor was struck with paralysis; his father showed
                    but little sympathy with his aspirations for universal culture, and could
                    imagine no career for him but that of a successful jurist. His sister had grown
                    somewhat harsh and cold during his absence, and was possessed by a morbid
                    self-consciousness, which she committed to the confidential pages of a secret
                    diary. The tone of this diary, partly the result of family temperament, partly
                    of the character of the age, throws an interesting light on the despair of
                    "Werther. Goethe’s mother was always the same to him, a bright, genial,
                    sympathetic friend. But her love could not ward off the pressure of
                    circumstances, or supply a substitute for a wider and more unfettered life.
                    Goethe, during his illness, received great attention from Fräulein von
                    Klettenberg, a friend of his mother’s, a pietist of the Moravian school. She
                    initiated him into the mystical writings of those abstracted saints, and she
                    engaged him in the study of alchemy, which served at once to prepare him for the
                    conception of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> and for the scientific researches of
                    his later days. During his stay at Frankfort he wrote very little. It may be
                    that the two Leipsic dramas received here their completed form. A farce in
                    memory of his Leipsic life, a poetical letter to Frederike Oeser, the daughter
                    of his teacher, a few songs, some of them religious, make up the tale of his
                    productions, as far as we know them.</p>
                <p>He arrived at Strasburg April 2, 1770. It was intended that after a sojourn in
                    the university of that place he should visit Paris, the centre of refinement.
                    Goethe stayed in Strasburg till August 28, 1771, his twenty-second birthday, and
                    these sixteen months are perhaps the most important of his life. During them he
                    came into active contact with most of those impulses of which his after life was
                    a development. If we would understand his mental growth, we must ask who were
                    his friends. He took his meals at the house of the Fräulein Lautlι in the
                    Krämergasse. The table was mainly filled with medical students. At the head of
                    it sat Salzmann, a grave man of fifty years of age. His experience and his
                    refined taste were very attractive to Goethe, who <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0747-0724"/> made him his intimate friend. Goethe was soon
                    drawn by the studies of his companions to desert his own. A notebook of this
                    date is preserved, which gives us a full account of his studies and employments.
                    He attended lectures on anatomy, on midwifery, and on chemistry. His own studies
                    were chiefly devoted to the last science; and he did not forget his favourite
                    alchemy. He had brought with him to Strasburg introductions to pietistic
                    circles, and this made him at first somewhat staid and retired in his pleasures,
                    and disinclined for general society. This soon wore off, and the natural
                    cheerfulness of his genial nature returned to him. Two songs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blinde</hi><hi rend="italic">Kuh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stirbt der
                    Puchs</hi><hi rend="italic">so</hi><hi rend="italic">gilt der Balg,</hi> refer
                    to the social life of this period. He went on picnics, he wrote French poetry,
                    he took dancing lessons, he learnt the violoncello. The table of the Fräulein
                    Lauth received some new guests. Among these was Jung-Stilling, the self-educated
                    charcoal-burner, who in his memoir has left a graphic account of Goethe’s
                    striking appearance, his broad brow, his flashing eye, his mastery of the
                    company, and his generosity of character. Another was Lerse, a frank open
                    character who became Goethe’s favourite, and whose name is immortalized in <hi
                    rend="italic">Götz</hi><hi rend="italic">von Berlichiηgeη.</hi> Goethe did not
                    desert his studies in art. He learnt from the constant study of the cathedral of
                    Strasburg the effect of Gothic architecture, and he shuddered when he saw the
                    reception-rooms of the youthful Marie Antoinette hung with tapestries which
                    represented the marriage of Jason and Medea, and seemed to forebode the coming
                    doom. His diary also shows that he spent much time in philosophical speculation.
                    But the most important event of his Strasburg sojourn was his acquaintance with
                    Herder. He was five years older than Goethe. Herder was then travelling as tutor
                    to the young prince of Holstein-Eutin, but was obliged to spend the whole winter
                    of 1770—71 in Strasburg on account of an affection of his eyes. Goethe was with
                    him every day, often all day. Herder, who was a pupil of a more original genius,
                    Hamann, taught him the true value of nature in art, and the principles of what
                    we should now call the romantic school. He made <hi rend="italic">Ossian</hi>
                    known to him, and the wealth of popular poetry in all nations which the
                    publication of <hi rend="italic">Ossian</hi> revealed; he enchanted him with the
                    idyllic simplicity of the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield;</hi> but, above
                    all, he shook his sensibility to the roots by revealing to him the power of the
                    mighty Shakespeare. He now saw how far superior Homer was to his Latin
                    imitators, and how false were the canons of French art. Goethe’s spirit was
                    liberated from its trammels, and <hi rend="italic">G'otz</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> became
                    possible to his mind. At a later period he forged for himself fetters of a
                    different kind.</p>
                <p>Goethe’s stay at Strasburg is generally connected still more closely with another
                    circumstance,—his passion for Frederike Brion of Sesenheim. The village lies
                    about twenty miles from Strasburg, and her father was pastor there. Goethe was
                    introduced by his friend Weyland, an Alsatian, as a poor theological student.
                    Fresh from his study of Goldsmith, he found the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of
                    Wakefield</hi> realized. The father was a simple worthy man, the eldest of the
                    three daughters was married, the two younger remained,— Maria Salome, whom
                    Goethe calls Olivia, and Frederike, to whom the poet principally devoted
                    himself. She was tall and slight, with fair hair and blue eyes, and just sixteen
                    years of age. Goethe gave himself up to the passion of the moment; what he felt
                    and suffered is known to us by his songs. At least ten songs are addressed to
                    her, and several others were written for her. During the winter of 1770, in the
                    intervals of his conversations with Herder, Goethe often rodeover to Sesenheim.
                    Neither storm, nor cold, nor darkness kept him back. He should have been busy
                    with his dissertation for the degree of doctor. The subject he had chosen was
                    the duty of providing an established church. But the attractions of Frederike
                    were a great interruption to his labours. In the spring Herder went away. The
                    fine weather drew him still more strongly to Sesenheim. Picnics, water parties,
                    games, dances, illuminated by enthusiasm for literature, filled up the weeks. As
                    his time for leaving Strasburg came nearer, he felt that this love was merely a
                    dream, and could have no serious termination. Frederike felt the same on her
                    side. A visit of the mother and daughters to Strasburg in July made this appear
                    more clearly. On August 6 Goethe took his degree as doctor of law. Shortly
                    afterwards he bade adieu to Sesenheim, and the tears stood in Frederike’s eyes
                    as he reached out his hand from horseback. From Frankfort he wrote bis final
                    farewell, and it was then, as he tells us, that he found from her answer for the
                    first time how deeply she had loved him. The account of this love episode in the
                    autobiography does Goethe injustice. There is nothing in the letters or the
                    poems of the time to show that he had wantonly trifled with her affections.
                    Eight years afterwards, on his way to Switzerland, he spent a night with the
                    Brions at Sesenheim, and was received with the utmost kindness. He was shown the
                    arbour where he had sat, the songs he had written, the carriage he had painted.
                    He left them in the morning with content. Frederike lived till 1813, well known
                    for her works of charity. She never married; the heart that Goethe had loved,
                    she said, should never love another.</p>
                <p>Goethe’s return to Frankfort is marked by a number of songs, of which the
                    “Wanderer’s Sturmlied” is the most remarkable. He found his Frankfort existence
                    more intolerable than before. He had outgrown many of the friends of his youth.
                    Those with whom he felt most sympathy were the two Schlossers and his sister
                    Cornelia. He found in her one who sympathized with all his aspirations. He cared
                    nothing for his profession; he was more determined than ever to devote himself
                    to letters, and not to law. He found in the neighbouring town of Darmstadt a
                    literary circle which Frankfort did not supply. The landgravine Caroline set a
                    good example, and had collected round her a number of kindred spirits, men and
                    women. Among them were Wenck, and Petersen, and Caroline Flachsland, who was
                    afterwards to marry Herder. But the soul of the literary circle was Merck, now
                    thirty years of age, attached to the war office. Goethe has represented him in
                    the autobiography as a cold and unfeeling cynic, a spirit who always said no, a
                    prototype of Mephistopheles. History represents him otherwise as a man of
                    cultivated and chastened judgment, a represser of enthusiasm, a respecter of the
                    rules of art, anxious to hold the balance between the old school and the new.
                    Goethe had dominated over all his other friends; Merck dominated over him. He
                    has left but little of his own writings. He was one of those who inspire genius
                    in others, and whose truest picture lives in the recollections of their friends.
                    These months were full of literary activity. To them belong an oration on
                    Shakespeare, delivered at Frankfort, an essay on Erwin von Steinbach, the
                    builder of the Strasburg cathedral, two theological treatises of a neologistic
                    character on the commandments of Moses and the miraculous tongues of Pentecost,
                    and a number of reviews written for the <hi rend="italic">Frankfurter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gelehrte Anzeiger,</hi> which had been founded by Merck. But the
                    work into which he threw all his genius was the dramatization of the history of
                    the imperial knight of the Middle Ages, Gottfried or Götz von Berlichingen. The
                    immediate cause of this enterprise was his enthusiasm for Shakespeare. After
                    reading him he felt, he said, like a blind man who suddenly receives his sight.
                    The unities of time and place vanished into nothing. The true form of art was
                    seen to be that which holds the wayward impulses together by an invisible bond,
                    just as in the life of man necessity is wedded <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0748-0725"/> to free will. The study of a dry and dull
                    biography of Götz, published in 1731, supplied the subject for his awakened
                    powers. From this miserable sketch he conceived within his mind a complete
                    picture of Germany in the 16th century. The chief characters of his play are
                    creatures of his imagination representing the principal types which made up the
                    history of the time. Every personage is made to live; they speak in short sharp
                    sentences like the powerful lines of a great master’s drawing. The first sketch
                    of <hi rend="italic">G'otz</hi> was finished in six weeks, in the autumn of
                    1771. Cornelia was consulted at every stage in the work. Herder saw it, and gave
                    his approval. On his return from Wetzlar in 1773 Goethe wrote the piece over
                    again, and published it, with the help of Merck, in the form in which we now
                    possess it. It ran like wild-fire through the whole of Germany. It was the
                    progenitor, not only of the “Sturm und Drang” period to which it gave the tone,
                    but of the romantic knightly literature which teemed from the German press. At a
                    later period, in 1804, Goethe prepared another edition for the stage, which took
                    five hours in acting. It has never been represented since.</p>
                <p>With the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Gοtz</hi> in his pocket, Goethe left
                    Frankfort in the spring of 1772 for Wetzlar, a quiet country town on the Lahn,
                    one of the seats of government of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperors lived at
                    Vienna; they were crowned at Frankfort; they <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> held
                    their parliaments at Ratisbon, and at Wetzlar their courts of justice. It was
                    the custom for young lawyers to attend the sittings of these courts for a
                    certain time before they could be admitted to practise on their own account. The
                    company of these students, of the embassies from the component parts of the
                    empire, and of various imperial officials, made the society a pleasant and
                    lively one. Goethe soon found friends. The secretary of the Brunswick legation,
                    Goué, formed a round table of knights,—a Ritter tafel. The members adopted names
                    from the age of chivalry, and apportioned among themselves the neighbouring
                    villages as eommanderies and fiefs. Goethe took the name of Götz. Deeds of
                    prowess were performed in friendly rivalry, chiefly of eating and drinking. This
                    masquerade at least served to keep the idea of Götz constantly before his mind.
                    But the place has sadder associations. It is impossible to dissociate the name
                    of Wetzlar from that of Werther. The Deutsches Haus, then the property of the
                    knights of the Teutonic order, exists still in the main street of Wetzlar. It
                    was occupied by one of the officials of the order, by name Buff’, au honest man
                    with a large family of children. The second daughter, Lotte, blue-eyed, fair,
                    and just twenty years of age, was first met by Goethe shortly after his arrival
                    at a ball at Wolpertshausen. She strongly attracted him; he became a constant
                    visitor at the house. He found that Lotte was a second mother to her brothers
                    and sisters, and he delighted to play games with them and tell them stories.
                    Lotte was really though not formally engaged to Kestner, a man of
                    two-and-thirty, secretary to the Hanoverian legation. The discovery of this
                    relation made no difference to Goethe; he remained the devoted friend to both.
                    He visited Lotte and her children; he walked with Kestner about the streets till
                    midnight; they kept their common birthday together in the German house on the
                    28th of August; Kestner felt no jealousy; Goethe was content with Lotte’s
                    friendship; her heart was large enough for both. But the position was too
                    critical to last. On September 10 they met in the German house for the last
                    time. Lotte spoke of the other world, and of the possibility of returning from
                    it. It was arranged between them that whoever died first should appear to the
                    others. This conversation confirmed Goethe’s purpose; he determined to go away.
                    He made no adieu, but wrote a line to Kestner to say that he could not have
                    borne to stay a moment longer. Merck had probably persuaded him to this step. To
                    divert his mind he took him to Ehrenbreitstein and introduced him to Sophie la
                    Roche, the friend of Wieland’s youth, and to her daughter Maximiliane, with whom
                    Goethe was charmed. The places in the neighbourhood of Coblentz were visited.
                    Goethe returned to Frankfort by the river in a yacht. Here he was possessed with
                    the memory of Lotte. He fastened her silhouette over his bed. Kestner came to
                    Frankfort in September; Goethe and Schlosser went together to Wetzlar in
                    November. Here he heard of the death of Jerusalem, a youngman attached to the
                    Brunswick legation. Fie had been with Goethe at the university of Leipsic, but
                    he had seen little of him at Wetzlar. Of a moody temperament, disheartened by
                    failure in his profession, and soured by a hopeless passion for the wife of
                    another, he had borrowed a pair of pistols from Kestner under pretence of a
                    journey, and had shot himself on the night of October 29.</p>
                <p>Goethe obtained a full narrative of the circumstances from Kestner, and
                    immediately afterwards began his <hi rend="italic">Werther,</hi> in which the
                    circumstances above related are all interwoven. Goethe tells us that it was
                    written in four weeks, but this can hardly have been the case. We have notices
                    of its slow progress during the whole of the summer of 1773. In 1774 it is far
                    advanced enough to be shown to some intimate friends. It is not till the middle
                    of September 1774 that two copies of the book are sent in the greatest secrecy
                    to Sophie la Roche and Lotte Buff. In October it spread over the whole of
                    Germany. It was enthusiastically beloved or sternly condemned. It was printed,
                    imitated, translated into every language of Europe, criticized in every
                    periodical, with the fullest meed of praise or scorn. It made the round of the
                    world, and penetrated even to China. The <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> fever
                    wrung the hearts of men and women with imaginary sorrows; floods of tears were
                    shed; young men dressed in blue coats and yellow breeches shot themselves with
                    <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> in their hands. It opened the floodgates of
                    pent-up sentimentalism which had been stirred by the philosophy of the time, and
                    which the calamities of the next generation were sternly to suppress. It may be
                    imagined that Kestner and Lotte were not well satisfied with the liberty which
                    Goethe had taken with them. They were married on April 4, 1773, and Goethe
                    provided the wedding ring. Notwithstanding the coolness which the publication of
                    <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> produced between them, the correspondence between
                    Goethe and Kestner continued to the end of the century. Lotte saw Goethe in
                    Weimar in 1816, when she was 63 years old; she was still beautiful, but her head
                    shook with palsy. She died in 1828. The second part of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther</hi> represents the agony of a jealous husband. This was inspired by
                    Brentano, an Italian merchant resident in Leipsic, a widower with five children,
                    who had married Maximiliane, the daughter of Sophie la Roche. Goethe loved her
                    as an elder brother, but her husband scarcely approved of the intimacy. Merck
                    tells us that his ideas went very little beyond his business, and that it was
                    dispiriting to have to look for his young girl friend among barrels of herrings
                    and piles of cheeses. “Goethe,” he says, “much consoles her for the smell of oil
                    and cheese, and for her husband’s manners.” <hi rend="italic">Götz</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Werther</hi> formed the solid foundation of Goethe’s fame. They
                    were read from one end of Germany to the other. It is difficult to imagine that
                    the same man can have produced both works, so different are they in matter and
                    in style. <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> represents the languid sentimentalism,
                    the passionate despair, which possessed an age vexed by evils which nothing but
                    the knife could cure, and tortured by the presence of a high ideal which
                    revealed to it at once the depth of its misery and the hopelessness of a better
                    lot. <hi rend="italic">Gotz</hi> was the first manly appeal to the chivalry of
                    German spirit, which, caught up by other voices, sounded throughout the
                    fatherland like the call of a warder’s trumpet,..till <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0749-0726"/> it produced a national courage founded on the
                    recollection of an illustrious past, which overthrew the might of the conqueror
                    at the moment when he seemed about to dominate the world. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther</hi> is the echo of Rousseau, the lamentation of a suffering world; <hi
                    rend="italic">Götz</hi> is the prototype of Stein, the corner stone of a
                    renovated empire. <hi rend="italic">Götz,</hi> in its short, sharp dialogue,
                    recalls the pregnant terseness of mediaeval German before it was spoilt by the
                    imitators of Ciceronian Latinity. <hi rend="italic">Werther,</hi> as soft and
                    melodious as Plato, was the first revelation to the world of that marvellous
                    style which, in the hands of a master, compels a language which is as rich as
                    Greek to be also as musical.</p>
                <p>These two great works were not the only occupations of Goethe at this time. In
                    Wetzlar he had translated Goldsmith's <hi rend="italic">Deserted Village,</hi>
                    and had written a number of small poems addressed to Lotte. The spring of 1773,
                    which witnessed the publication of 6⅛te, saw him actively employed as an
                    advocate. His relations with his father became easier. His literary success
                    brought him a number of friends,—the young Counts Stolberg, and Von Schönborn,
                    afriend of Klopstock’s. He also began to correspond with Lavater the
                    physiognomist and with Klυpstock himself. To the latter half of this year are to
                    be referred a number of satirical poems, aimed at prevailing follies of the
                    time, clever and amusing, but of little permanent value. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peter Brey</hi> he satirized the meddler Leuchsenring, who, with soft tread and
                    lamblike manners, interfered with the family relations of Herder. <hi
                    rend="italic">Satyros</hi> is directed agaiust the prophets of the school of
                    nature, who bid us return to nature without remembering how coarse and repellent
                    some aspects of nature are. Bahrdt had translated the Bible into modern
                    cultivated German; Goethe wrote a prologue to this newest of divine revelations,
                    in which the four evangelists appear each with his attendant animal. Of yet
                    another kind is the <hi rend="italic">Fair of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Plundersweilern,</hi> in which the hucksters and booth-keepers represent the
                    motley variety of human life and the characteristics of modern littérateurs. It
                    is a foretaste of the second part of <hi rend="italic">Faust. Harlequin's
                    Marriage</hi> is only preserved in fragments; it was perhaps too coarse and
                    personal to be published. The most important of these writings is <hi
                    rend="italic">Gods, Heroes, and Wieland,</hi> a dialogue in the style of Lucian
                    written at a sitting over a bottle of Burgundy, in which Alcestis, Mercury,
                    Hercules, Euripides, and other ancient worthies appear to Wieland in all their
                    original greatness, and upbraid him with the mean and paltry representation of
                    them which he had given to the world. Wieland was the apostle of an emasculated
                    antiquity. Goethe would make the gods speak in their own, large utterance if
                    they spoke at all. Wieland revenged himself by recommending the satire in his
                    paper, the <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Merkur,</hi> as a
                    delicate piece of persiflage worthy of the study of his readers. In November
                    Goethe’s sister Cornelia was married to Schlosser and left Strasburg. Goethe
                    felt the loss deeply. She lived but a short time. Her married life was tortured
                    with perpetual suffering, and she died in 1777.</p>
                <p>The beginning of 1774 is marked by a new passion and a new work. Crespel had
                    invented a plan for enlivening their social meetings; each man was to draw lots
                    for a partner, and for the time to consider her as his wife. Three times Goethe
                    drew the name of Anna Sibylla Münch, a pleasant girl of sixteen, daughter of a
                    merchant. One of the favourite topics of the day was the trial of Beaumarchais,
                    which ended on February 16, 1774. Immediately afterwards his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi> or pleadings were published, and from the fourth of these the
                    play of <hi rend="italic">Clavigo</hi> was arranged. It represents a young
                    writer of ambition deserting the woman to whom he is engaged and breaking her
                    heart. The fifth act, in which Clavigo kills himself, is Goethe’s own. The real
                    Clavigo died, a distinguished man of letters, in 1806. The piece was written in
                    eight days, and published on June 1. It had a great success, and still keeps the
                    stage. But Goethe’s best friends were disappointed with it. Merck told him not
                    to write such trash, as others could do that as well. In reality there is no
                    period of Goethe’s life in which his literary activity was so prodigious, or
                    when he was more fully occupied with literary plans which had reference to the
                    deepest problems of human nature. To this time belong the conceptions of <hi
                    rend="italic">Caesar, Faust, Mahomet,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Wandering
                    Jew,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prometheus.</hi> The first was soon given up; of
                    the second the first monologue, the dialogue between Faust and Mephistopheles,
                    and part of the scenes with Gretchen, were now written. He has told us in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> what he intended to make of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahomet.</hi> In five acts he was to show us how the purity of
                    prophetic zeal is recognized by love, rejected by envy, sullied by human
                    weakness, spiritualized by death. To write this drama he had studied the Koran
                    through and through; only a few fragments were completed. Of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wandering Jew</hi> very little remains to us. The design,
                    conceived in Italy, of making a great work on the subject was never carried out.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi> was completed in two acts. The monologue
                    of <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi> included in the <hi rend="italic">Lyrical
                    Poems,</hi> was written at the same time; but it is doubtful whether it was
                    intended to form part of the drama. These works are to be referred to the study
                    of the ethics of Spinoza, for whom he now began to feel a deep reverence, which
                    continued throughout his life. The calm repose of Spinoza’s mind spread over his
                    own like a breath of peace; his systematic and well-ordered reasoning was the
                    best antidote to Goethe’s passionate waywardness. Goethe now acquired a wider
                    view of all the relations of the moral and natural world; he felt that he had
                    never seen the world so clearly. His time at Frankfort was also largely occupied
                    with art. His room was covered with the works of his pencil, and a number of
                    poems on the subject of the artist’s life arose from the same influence.</p>
                <p>The summer of 1774 was spent in a journey to the Rhine. On July 12 Basedow, the
                    educational reformer, came to Frankfort; three days afterwards Goethe went with
                    him to Ems, where he found Lavater, who had been with him in the previous month.
                    The three went down the Lahn together, and reached Coblentz on July 18. Here the
                    famous dinner took place at which Lavater explained the secrets of the
                    Apocalypse to a clergyman, Basedow demonstrated the uselessness of baptism to a
                    dancing master, while Goethe, the worldling between the two prophets, made the
                    best of his time with the fish and the chicken. They then went down the Rhine to
                    Elberfeld, where Goethe found his old Strasburg friend Jung-Stilling, and back
                    to Pempelfort, near Düsseldorf, the house of Fritz Jacobi, where Goethe also met
                    Jacobi’s wife Betty, his sister Charlotte, his aunt Johanna Fahlmer, and his
                    friend W. Heinse. Their letters are full of the effect which he produced upon
                    them. Heinse says— “I know of no man in the whole history of learning who, at
                    such an age, was so completely full of original genius.” Jacobi writes—“Goethe
                    is the man whom my heart required; my character will now gain its proper
                    stability; the man is complete from head to foot.” Again he says that you could
                    not be an hour with him, without seeing that it would be ridiculous to suppose
                    that he could think or act otherwise than he really thinks and acts. No change
                    could make him fairer or better; his nature has followed its own development, as
                    the growth of a seed, or of a flower on a tree. Nor were these impressions
                    evanescent. Forty years afterwards he writes of these times —“What hours! what
                    days! I seemed to have a new soul. From that moment forth I would never leave
                    you.”</p>
                <p>Goethe returned to Frankfort at the beginning of August. The autumn brought new
                    friends, drawn to him by the fame of the newly published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther.</hi> Among these was Klopstock, twenty-five years older than Goethe,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n750/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0750-0727"/> and author of the <hi rend="italic">Messiah,</hi>
                    the acknowledged head of German poets. On December 11 Goethe was surprised by
                    the visit of a stranger, whom he at first took for Fr. Jacobi. It was Karl
                    Ludwig von Knebel, who was travelling with the two young princes of Saxe-Weimar,
                    the reigning duke Karl August, then just seventeen, and his younger brother
                    Constantine. They were on their way to France with their tutor, Count Görz, and
                    they could not pass through Frankfort without making the acquaintance of the new
                    genius who had risen upon their country. Goethe went to see them, w as warmly
                    received, and talked with them about the condition and prospects of Germany.
                    This meeting decided the future course of Goethe’s life. Knebel thought Goethe
                    “the best of men, the most lovable of mankind.” The princes invited him to visit
                    them at Mainz, where they would stay longer than at Frankfort. The visit lasted
                    from December 13 to 15, when they went on to Carlsruhe, where the duke was to
                    meet his intended bride. Goethe took the opportunity of reconciling himself with
                    Wieland, who lived in Weimar. On his return he found Fräulein von Klettenberg
                    dead. “My Klettenberg is dead,” he writes, “before I had an idea that she was
                    dangerously ill. Dead and buçied in my absence! She who was so dear, so much to
                    me.” Frederike was lost to him, Charlotte, Maximiliane, and his sister married.
                    Some attachment was a necessity of his nature. He now came under the influence
                    of Lili Schönemann, the daughter of a rich banker, whose father was dead, but
                    whose mother conducted the business, and held one of the most brilliant salons
                    in Frankfort. This passion seemed to be of a more lasting nature than the
                    others. Goethe was drawn into the whirl of society. He is described as moving in
                    brilliantly-lighted rooms, in a gold-laced coat, passing from party to concert,
                    from concert to ball, held captive by a fair· haired girl with a pair of bright
                    eyes. Such was Goethe in the carnival time. To Lili’s influence we owe several
                    of his smaller poems, <hi rend="italic">Neue Liebe neues Leben, Herz mein Herz
                    was soll das geben, Heidenroslein,</hi> and two little vaudevilles, <hi
                    rend="italic">Erwin und Elmire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Claudine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">von Villa Bella.</hi> The first contains some pretty songs,
                    notably “<hi rend="italic">Das Veilchen,”</hi> set to music by Mozart. It is
                    founded on the ballad of “Edwin and Angelina” in the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of
                    Wakefield.</hi> The latter half belongs to an earlier period, and is complete in
                    itself. <hi rend="italic">Claudine von Villa Bella</hi> has one good character,
                    the prodigal son Crugantino; and the ballad which is sung at the crisis of the
                    plot was written during the Rhine journey with Jacobi. To this period also
                    belongs <hi rend="italic">Stella,</hi> a comedy for lovers, a strange, wild
                    play, full of extravagant passion. The weak-minded hero Fernando marries two
                    wives one after the other. They meet together in an inn, and he is reduced to
                    extremity of misery. He loves them both, and they both love him. Finally, the
                    first wife Stella surrenders her rights, and they agree all to live together.
                    The play in this form suggested to Canning the parody of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rovers, or the Double Arrangement.</hi> In 1806 Goethe altered the close by
                    making Fernando shoot himself and Stella take poison. It is seldom performed,
                    but Stella is a fine character for a great actress. It is said to be founded on
                    an occurrence in the Jacobi family.</p>
                <p>Neither family approved of the engagement between the youthful couple. Goethe’s
                    parents thought Lili too much of a fine lady; they had a suspicion, which was
                    well founded, that her wealth had no very sure foundation. Frau Schönemann did
                    not think that Goethe, with all his genius, would make a good husband for her
                    child. Cornelia Schlosser was strongly opposed to the match. Goethe tore himself
                    away, and went for a tour in Switzerland. His companions were the brothers
                    Stolberg, noisy, wild young noblemen, who in May had stayed at Goethe’s house.
                    They gave Goethe’s mother the name of Frau Aya, which she ever afterwards
                    retained. On his journey Goethe visited the duke of Saxe-Weimar and his
                    betrothed at Carlsruhe, his sister at Emmendingen, Lavater at Zurich. He bore
                    with him the constant memory of Lili; he wore a golden heart which she had given
                    him round his neck. He climbed the St Gotthard on her birthday, and looked with
                    longing eyes to the promised land of Italy. But a stronger power drew him home
                    again, and he returned. At Strasburg he met his old friends, and saw Zimmermann,
                    the writer on solitude. He showed him a profile of Frau.von Stein who lived at
                    Weimar, with which Goethe was enchanted.</p>
                <p>He returned to Frankfort on July 20. August was spent delightfully with Lili at
                    Offenbach; his letters speak of nothing but her. September and the fair-time at
                    Frankfort brought back his troubles. His position is described in the poem <hi
                    rend="italic">Lili's Park.</hi> He is the half-tamed bear who is held by magic
                    bands amongst the birds and the fish, and yet sees a door left a little open for
                    escape, and swears that he has the power to pass it. During this last period of
                    his passion he translated part of the Song of Solomon. Lie wrote some scenes in
                    <hi rend="italic">Faust—</hi> the walk in the garden, the first conversation
                    with Mephistopheles, the interview with the scholar, the scene in Auerbach’s
                    cellar. <hi rend="italic">Egmont</hi> was also begun under the stimulus of the
                    American Rebellion. A way of escaping from his embarrassments was unexpectedly
                    opened to him. The duke of Weimar passed through Frankfort both before and after
                    his marriage, which took place on October 3. He invited Goethe to stay at
                    Weimar, and it was arranged that one of the duke’s household, who was expected
                    every day with a new carriage, should bring him with him. He took leave of
                    everyone, including Lili. But the carriage did not come; a second leave-taking
                    was impossible. He remained all day in the house working at <hi rend="italic"
                    >Egmont,</hi> going out only at night. Once he stood by Lili’s window, heard her
                    sing his songs, and saw her shadow on the curtain. He could not linger longer in
                    the town. He started for Heidelberg hoping to meet the carriage, determined if
                    it did not come to go on to Italy. He was summoned hastily back by a messenger,
                    found the carriage at Frankfort, and entered Weimar in the early morning of
                    November 7, 1775. It was not for his happiness or for Lili’s that they should
                    have married. She afterwards thanked him deeply for the firmness with which he
                    overcame a temptation to which she would have yielded.</p>
                <p>At this time the smaller German courts were beginning to take an interest in
                    German literature. Before the Seven Years’ War the whole of German culture had
                    been French. Even now German writers found but scant acceptance at Berlin or
                    Vienna. The princes of the smaller states, shut out from the great world of
                    politics, surrounded themselves with literature and art, and with men who would
                    be likely to give an interest to their lives. The duke of Brunswick had made
                    Lessing his librarian at Wolfenbüttel, and had not objected to the publication
                    of <hi rend="italic">Emilia Gαlotti.</hi> Emmerich Joseph, the worldly elector
                    and archbishop of Mainz, was devoted to Munich and the theatre, and made his
                    stage one of the best in Europe. The margrave of Baden had invited Klopstock to
                    his court, and delighted to associate with himself the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Messiah,</hi> the “poet of religion and of his country.” The duke
                    of Würtemberg paid special attention to education; he promoted the views of
                    Schubart, and founded the school in which Schiller was educated. Hanover offered
                    a home to Zimmermann, and encouraged the development of Schlegel. Darmstadt was
                    specially fortunate. Caroline, the wife of the landgrave, had surrounded herself
                    with a literary circle, of which Merck was the moving spirit. She had collected
                    and privately printed the odes of Klopstock, and her death in 1774 seemed to
                    leave Darmstadt a desert. Her daughter <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0751-0728"/> Louise, the youngest of eight children, seemed to
                    have inherited something of her mother’s qualities, veiled by a serious and
                    retiring temper. She married on October 3, 1775, the young duke of Weimar, who
                    was just of age. She reigned over that illustrious court respected and admired,
                    but repelled rather than attracted by its brilliancy and eccentricity. The place
                    which she would naturally have occupied was taken by the duchess Amalia, mother
                    of the grand-duke. She was of the house of Brunswick, and after two years of
                    marriage had been left a widow at nineteen with two sons. She committed their
                    education to Count Görz, a prominent character in the history of the time. She
                    afterwards summoned Wieland to instruct the elder, and Knebel to instruct the
                    younger. The <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Merkur,</hi>
                    founded in 1773 to diminish the influence of the school of Klopstock, gave
                    Weimar importance in the literary world. The duchess was a great lover of the
                    stage, and the best play writers of Germany worked for Weimar. The palace and
                    the theatre were burnt down in 1774, and the duchess had to content herself with
                    amateurs. After her son’s marriage she lived in the simple country houses which
                    surround the capital, the lofty Ettersburg, the low-lying Tiefurt, the
                    far-seeing height of Belvedere. Each of these was awakened to new life by the
                    genius of Goethe. The duke, eighteen years of age, was simple in his tastes,
                    abater of etiquette and constraint, true, honest, and steadfast, fond of novelty
                    and excitement, of great courage and activity; his impulses, rarely checked, led
                    him rather to chivalrous enterprise than to undesirable excess. His brother,
                    Prince Constantine, had perhaps more talent but less character than the
                    grand-duke. He took but little part in the Weimar life, and died in 1793.</p>
                <p>Upon this society Goethe, in the strength and beauty of youth, rose like a star.
                    From the moment of his arrival he became the inseparable and indispensable
                    companion of the grand-duke. * He subdued the affections of all he met with.
                    Wieland said that his soul was as full of him as a dewdrop of the morning sun.
                    He was, take him all in all, the greatest, best, most noble human being that God
                    had ever created. The first months at Weimar were spent in a wild round of
                    pleasure. Goethe was treated as a guest. In the autumn, journeys, rides,
                    shooting parties, in the winter, balls, masquerades, skating parties by
                    torchlight, dancing at peasants’ feasts, filled up their time. Evil reports flew
                    about Germany; the court of Weimar had a bad name; Klopstock wrote letters of
                    solemn advice, and forbade his young friend Stolberg to accept an appointment
                    which the duke had offered to him. We do not know, and we need not examine, how
                    much of these reports was true. Goethe wrote to Klopstock that if Stolberg came
                    he would find them no worse, and perhaps even better, than he had known them
                    before. We may believe that no decencies were disregarded except the artificial
                    restrictions of courtly etiquette. Goethe and the duke dined together and bathed
                    together; the duke addressed his friend by the familiar <hi rend="italic"
                    >thou.</hi> Goethe slept in his chamber, and tended him when he was ill. In the
                    spring he had to decide whether he would go or stay. In April the duke gave him
                    the little garden by the side of the Ilm, with its lofty roof, in which he lived
                    for the next eight years. In J une he invested him with the title, so important
                    to Germans, of geheim -legati onsrath, with a seat and voice in the privy
                    council, and an income of £180 a year. By accepting this he was bound to Weimar
                    for ever. We may here mention the different grades of service through which
                    Goethe passed. In January 1779 he undertook the commission of war; on September
                    5, 1779, he became geheim-rath; in September 1781 he received an addition to his
                    salary of £30. This was afterwards raised by £G0 more, and in 1816 he received
                    £450, with an additional allowance for the expense of a carriage. In April 1782
                    he was ennobled by the emperor, and took for his arms a silver star in an azure
                    field; in June of the same year he became president of the chamber <hi
                    rend="italic">ad interim.</hi> We know that Goethe devoted himself with industry
                    and enthusiasm to the public business; he made himself acquainted with every
                    part of his master’s territory; he did his best,to develop its resources; he
                    opened mines and disseminated education; he threw himself with vigour into the
                    reconstruction of the tiny army. A complete account of his labours in this field
                    cannot be known until the secrets of the Goethe house at Weimar, now
                    hermetically closed, are opened to the curious. We shall then probably find that
                    Goethe cannot be fairly charged with want of patriotism, or coldness to the
                    national interest, and that his apparent indifference to the rising of 1813 must
                    be considered in connexion with his resistance to the encroachments of Austria
                    at an earlier time.</p>
                <p>Goethe’s life was at no time complete without the influence of a noble-hearted
                    woman. This he found in Charlotte von Stein, a lady of the court, wife of the
                    master of the horse. She was thirty-three years of age, mother of seven
                    children. His letters to her extend over a period of fifty years. Until his
                    journey to Italy he made her acquainted with every action, every thought of his
                    mind, all the working of his brain. He calls her by every endearing epithet—the
                    sweet entertainment of his inmost heart, the dear unconquerable source of his
                    happiness, the sweet dream of his life, the anodyne of his sorrows, his
                    happiness, his gold, his magnet, whom he loves in presence and absence, sleeping
                    and waking, from whom he can never bear to be parted. Many of Goethe’s writings
                    were from this time inspired by the necessities of the court. One group of them
                    is formed by the succession of masks or ballets which were performed to
                    celebrate the birthday of the grandduchess Louise. <hi rend="italic">The Pour
                    Seasons, The Procession of Laplanders, the Nine Female Virtues, The Dance of the
                    Planets,</hi> are sufficiently explained by their names. Others were called for
                    by the amateur theatre, which now was forced to supply the place of the regular
                    drama. The stage was often set in the open air, the seats cut out of turf; the
                    side scenes, of trimmed box, still exist at Belvedere and Ettersburg. The actors
                    were the duchess-mother and her sons, the civil servants and the officers, the
                    ladies in waiting and the pages. Goethe was very good in comic parts; insolemn
                    tragedy, as in his own <hi rend="italic">Orestes,</hi> he could best interpret
                    the dignity of the ancient stage. Musaeus, head-master of the public school, was
                    set to play low comedy; Knebel represented the dignified hero. The chief
                    professional support of the stage was Corona Schröter, whom the duke and Goethe
                    personally carried off from Leipsic. On this visit he saw, after a long absence,
                    Catherine Schönkopf, Oeser, and other friends of his youth. Goethe represented
                    most of his earlier pieces on the "Weimar stage. He wrote nothing of great
                    importance for it till the first sketch of his <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie.</hi>
                    But several smaller pieces owe their origin to this cause. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proserpina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Die Geschιvister</hi> are melodramas; <hi

                    and <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Fischerin</hi> are little operas
                    composed to suit the Weimar taste. <hi rend="italic">Scherz,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">List,</hi><hi rend="italic">und Hache</hi> is an imitation of the
                    Italian style..</p>
                <p>Besides numerous visits to the court of the Thuringian princes, sojournings at
                    Dörnberg and at Ilmenau, that retired nook of the Weimar fatherland which still
                    attracts many a pilgrim lover of Goethe, the first ten years at Weimar were
                    interrupted by longer journeys. One of these was the winter Harz journey in
                    December 1777,undertaken suddenly to make the acquaintance of Blessing, a
                    self-torturing hypochondriac, who bad written to the poet for advice. With
                    Goethe’s help Plessing recovered from his melancholy, visited him at Weimar, and
                    entertained him as professor at <pb break="no"

                    France. A visit to Dessau inspired the improvements of the park and grounds at
                    Weimar, which now make it so attractive. The close of 1779 was occupied by a
                    winter journey to Switzerland, undertaken with the duke and a small retinue. Two
                    days were spent at Frankfort with Goethe’s parents. Sesenheim was visited, and
                    left with satisfaction and contentment. At Strasburg they found Lili happily
                    married, with a new-born child. At Emmendingen Goethe stood by his sister’s
                    grave, and saw her successor Johanna Fahlmer, Jacobi’s aunt. The Swiss journey
                    began at Basel. The chief object of it was to forward the health and education
                    of the young duke. It was a bold plan to execute in October and November. From
                    Bern they made the tour of the Bernese Oberland. From Geneva, by the advice of
                    De Saussure, they visited Mont Blanc and the valley of Chamouni; they crossed
                    the Furka, not without danger, in the middle of November, descended the St
                    Gotthard to Lucerne, and visited Lavater at Zurich, the seal and summit of their
                    tour. From this time Lavater lost his influence over Goethe, and in 1786 he
                    would gladly have run away from Weimar to avoid him. In December they went by
                    the Lake of Constance and the falls of the Rhine to Stuttgart, where, on
                    December 14, Goethe saw Schiller for the first time. He was a student at the
                    Academy, and in Goethe’s presence received the prize.</p>
                <p>The return to Weimar, on January 13, was the beginning of a new era. The period
                    of genius and eccentricity was at an end; that of order and regularity
                    succeeded. As an outward sign of the change, the duke cut off his pigtail, an
                    example which was long without imitators. Wieland said that the Swiss winter
                    journey was the greatest of Goethe’s dramas. In the same serious mood Goethe
                    began to write history. He chose for his subject Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar,
                    the knight-errant of the Reformation. He spent much time and trouble in
                    collecting materials, but at length reasonably concluded that his strength lay
                    elsewhere. At this time also he began to write <hi rend="italic">Tasso,</hi> and
                    adapted the <hi rend="italic">Birds</hi> of Aristophanes to modern
                    circumstances. His deeper thoughts were concentrated in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wilhelm Meister.</hi> Countess Werther, the sister of the great minister Baron
                    von Stein, whom he visited at Neunheiligen, was transferred in living
                    portraiture to its pages. His efforts for the development of the duke’s dominion
                    naturally led him to the study of science. The opening and direction of mines
                    induced him to study geology; the classification of ancient forms of life led
                    him to osteology and anatomy. Goethe was always fond of children. The young
                    Herders and Wielands spent much time in his garden, sometimes digging for Easter
                    eggs which had been carefully concealed. In the spring of 1783 Fritz, the son of
                    Charlotte von Stein, then ten years old, came to live with him in his garden
                    house. In the autumn they took a journey together in the Harz. At Ilmenau was
                    written the touching poem of that name on the duke’s birthday. Goethe reviews in
                    it their common friendship and activity as far as it has yet gone, and a few
                    days afterwards, as he slept in the hut on the Gickelhahn, he wrote in pencil
                    the world-known lines in which he anticipates for himself that rest and silence
                    which then held enchained the summits of the hills and the birds of the wood. In
                    the following year another journey was undertaken in the Harz for the study of
                    mineralogy. But this was only a relaxation from more serious affairs. In 1785
                    the Fürstenbund or league of princes was formed, under the supremacy of
                    Frederick the Great, to resist the ambition of Austria under Joseph II. The duke
                    of Saxe-Weimar took an important part in forming this league, and in the
                    negotiations which preceded it. Goethe was his indispensable adviser, and must
                    on this occasion, if not on others, have taken a keen interest in politics and
                    in the independence of Germany.</p>
                <p>The year 1786 marksan epoch in Goethe’s life. He had now been ten years in
                    Weimar, and he must have felt that his own inward development, and the work
                    which he was most fitted to do in the world, were not advancing as favourably as
                    they should. He had written little of first-rate importance. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Lyrics</hi> were of intense beauty and of deep meaning, but they
                    were short and fugitive. He had brought with him from Frankfort the sketches of
                    <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> but little had
                    been done to them since. His occasional writings for the amateur theatre, or for
                    court festivities, were not such as to add to his solid reputation in Germany.
                    <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi> was the one great work of poetry which belongs
                    entirely to this period, but that had not received its final form. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tasso</hi> was conceived, but only two acts were written, and
                    these in prose. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> is the most exact
                    expression of this portion of Goethe’s life; but loftily as it now towers above
                    the level of his dramas, it did not then satisfy the author, nor was it in a
                    state to be published. For the completion of these works Goethe required leisure
                    and repose, impossible to obtain in the distraction and pleasures of the court.
                    This became more apparent to him as he set himself to collect his scattered
                    writings, Four volumes were soon completed, but the preparation of the other
                    four convinced him how much labour many of his poems still required for
                    perfection. Another cause of discontent was his relation to Frau von Stein. It
                    could not have been more intimate. She was all to Goethe and more than Gretchen,
                    Frederike, Lili, or his sister Cornelia had been. He communicated to her every
                    thought and every action of his life. The relation was blameless, to a character
                    like Goethe’s it was natural; but it became every year more difficult and more
                    full of danger. The ardent devotion which sat well on the impetuosity of youth
                    was less becoming and less possible to the man of middle age. Yet the tie could
                    not be severed without a struggle, and the wrench could not be effected without
                    an enforced absence. To these necessities, the need of quiet for composition,
                    and for deliberately rearranging the circumstances of his life, was added the
                    stress of other impulses. Goethe had all his life been fascinated by the
                    practice of art. Indeed it was not until he had discovered at Rome the
                    limitation of his powers that he definitely renounced the hope of becoming an
                    artist. He tried almost every branch in turn. He drew in pencil and in sepia,
                    sketched, painted in oil, engraved on copper and wood, and etched. For these
                    occupations he had but little leisure; at this time he attributed his slow
                    improvement rather to want of labour than to want of power. He saw infinite
                    possibilities of advance in a life of freedom spent under the inspiration of
                    sunny skies, and amidst the environment of the highest art.</p>
                <p>Of still deeper interest and importance were his scientific researches. In these
                    he aspired to detect the secrets of nature; he succeeded in seeing, as in a
                    vision, the great scheme of evolution applied to all phenomena of the natural
                    and moral world, which the labours of many workers have revealed to us in our
                    own day. He longed for time and leisure to perfect these ideas, to base them on
                    solid fact. Goethe has not added much of positive value to the treasury of
                    scientific truth, but he deserves the credit of having dis∙ cerned the right
                    method of inquiry when it was obscure to many, and of having thrown that glow of
                    imagination over dry and technical inquiry, without which no great discoveries
                    can be made. His inquiries into the nature of light belong to a later time. He
                    began with physiognomy under the auspices of Lavater. From this he was led to
                    the study of anatomy, and especially to the comparison of the skeletons of men
                    and animals. In this department he made a real discovery, that the
                    intermaxillary bone which exists in the lower animals is found in the human
                    subject in a rudimentary<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0753-0730"/> state,—that it is seen distinctly in youth, but
                    as years advance is united with the body of the skull. The discovery that the
                    skull itself is only a development of the vertebrae of the spine was made a
                    little later. He was led to this further step by picking up the head of a sheep
                    on the shore of the Lido at Venice. The care of his garden cottage naturally led
                    him to the study of plants. He soon found himself attracted to wide and
                    comprehensive generalizations. The <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses of
                    Plants</hi> was not published till 1790, but the idea which had possession of
                    his mind was a solid contribution to the science of botany. Goethe sought to
                    discover an original or standard flower, from which, as from a Platonic ideal
                    type, all existing flowers were deflexions and aberrations. In this he followed
                    an unscientific method, but he clearly saw that all the different parts of the
                    plant, except the stem and the root, might be regarded as modifications of the
                    leaf; that leaf, calyx, corolla, bud, pistil, and stamen were all referable to
                    the same type; and that whether a plant produced leaves, or flowers, or fruit,
                    depended on the differentiation of the nutrition which it received. Less
                    fortunate were his speculations in geology, to which he devoted a very large
                    portion of his time and thoughts. It is something that he recognized the
                    importance and reality of that science, then in its infancy, which has had to
                    undergo more than its due share of obloquy and distrust. But he was of necessity
                    a follower of Werner, who based his classification of rocks rather on the
                    minerals which they contained than upon an examination of the fossil remains of
                    organic life. All these causes contributed together to one end. His desire to
                    complete the great poetical works which he had begun, to disentangle his life
                    from the complexities which had entwined themselves round it, to give a fair
                    trial to his impulses towards art, to afford opportunity for the careful and
                    systematic interrogation of nature, and, above all, a longing to possess his
                    soul in peace, and solemnly to probe in silence the depths of his own being,
                    conspired together to drive him from Weimar to the land which he had yearned
                    after from boyhood. The resolution, slowly formed, was boldly executed. In the
                    summer of 1785 he had visited Carlsbad for the first time, passed a pleasant
                    month in the company of the duchess Louise, Herder, and Frau von Stein. In July
                    1786 he paid it a second visit. After five weeks of brilliant society, very
                    favourable to his health, spent in revising his works for the press, he stole
                    secretly away. The duke alone knew that he designed an absence of some duration.
                    In the strictest incognito, in the guise of a German merchant, he drove alone to
                    the land of the citron and the orange.</p>
                <p>Goethe’s Italian journey, the most momentous epoch in the development of his
                    intellectual life, lasted from September 3, 1786, to June 18, 1788. Assuming the
                    common German name of Miiller, in the strictest incognito he journeyed by way of
                    Munich, where he studied the picture gallery and the collection of antiquities;
                    by the Lake of Garda, where he began his metrical version of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi><hi rend="italic">∙,</hi> by Verona, where he saw
                    the first specimen of Roman building in Italy in the stupendous amphitheatre; by
                    Vicenza, where he was attracted by the grace and harmony of the classical
                    Palladio; by Padua, where he neglected the frescos of Giotto, but rose to a
                    clear conception of the form of the <hi rend="italic">original plant</hi> by the
                    marks on the leaves of a palm in the botanical garden; to Venice, where for the
                    first time he was able to taste the charm and richness of southern life. As he
                    proceeded farther, Ferrara spoke to him of Tasso; Bologna showed him the great
                    masters of the academic school who have now grown pale and dim before the
                    predecessors of Raphael; Florence interested him a little; Assisi drew his
                    attention, not to the triple church of Saint Francis, the unrivalled museum of
                    religious art, but to the little ruined temple which no modern traveller would
                    notice but for the name of Goethe; Spoleto again delighted him with the remains
                    of ancient architecture. He reached Rome on Octo- ' her 28. His first stay was
                    till February. The constant companion of his studies was the painter Tischbein,
                    who helped him to disentangle the many difficulties of the old Rome and the new.
                    He lived chiefly among the German artists and men of letters who frequented the
                    Caffé Greco. Among these were Angelica Kaufmann and Moritz, who deepened his
                    knowledge of German versification, and prepared him for the composition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Iphigenia.</hi> Although Goethe occupied himself chiefly with
                    drawing, he was able to announce on June 6 that this work was finished. The
                    second <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie,</hi> written in verse, was the first
                    important fruit of the Italian journey. It is in very strong contrast with <hi
                    rend="italic">G'otz von Berlichingen.</hi> It is written in the strictest
                    classical form. Although based on the <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tauris</hi> of Euripides, it has little in common with it. In
                    Euripides Thoas is represented as a cruel barbarian, against whom it is
                    justifiable to employ every artifice of fraud or violence. In Goethe the
                    characters are ennobled by a higher principle, and the struggle between truth
                    and falsehood is made a prominent motive of the piece. When Thoas discovers
                    that, according to the oracle of Apollo, the return of Orestes’s sister to
                    Greece will satisfy the anger of the gods, he gives his consent, and his last
                    words are a friendly farewell. Towards the end of February Goethe left Rome for
                    Naples. Here he was attracted less by the remains of antiquity, even the new
                    revelations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, than by the prospects of nature, the
                    bay, the islands, the volcano, the thousand beauties which make the gulf
                    unrivalled in the world, and by the multitudinous and teeming life which throngs
                    the endless quays that line the shore. Sorrento stimulated him to the révisai of
                    <hi rend="italic">Torquato Tasso,</hi> but he did not complete the drama till
                    his return from Italy. It did not appear in print till the spring of 1790. The
                    play had a special fascination for him as a picture of his own distracted life.
                    He could depict with feeling the struggle between the actual and the ideal, the
                    ill-assortment of a passionate poet with the jealous and artificial environment
                    of a court. At the end of March Goethe sailed to Sicily; rolled up in his cloak
                    he meditated the composition of his <hi rend="italic">Tasso.</hi> Sicily struck
                    him, as it must strike all travellers who have studied the ancient world, as a
                    revelation of Greece. It is, if one may say so, more Greek than Greece itself.
                    Its mountains, streams, trees, flowers, the form of its boats and pottery, the
                    habits of the people, the quivering smile of the bright blue sea fringed with
                    golden sand, represent completely the Greece of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> and of the choruses of Euripides. Goethe was overmastered by this
                    powerful influence. He sketched and began <hi rend="italic">Nausicaa,</hi> the
                    story of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> in dramatic form, which always
                    remained a fragment. He returned to Rome in June. The rest of the year was spent
                    in the city and its neighbourhood, in the serious study of drawing, for which
                    unfortunately he had but little talent, and in the composition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> a work begun with the approval of his father in the
                    early Frankfort days. It was finished in September 1787, and appeared in the
                    Easter of the following year. Although <hi rend="italic">Egmoηt</hi> still keeps
                    the stage, it has very grave faults. It is an unfortunate mixture of the natural
                    and ideal treatment. The licence with which the scenes are transposed in modern
                    performance shows how much the work lacks symmetry and cohesion. Schiller
                    criticized it severely as being untrue to history. He described the close, where
                    all difficulties are solved by the appearance of Cliirchen,as a <hi
                    rend="italic">deus ex</hi><hi rend="italic">machina</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    into the world of opera. The music of Beethoven has contributed to it a charm of
                    art which was necessary to its completeness. Besides this, Goethe rewrote for
                    publication his early vaudevilles of <hi rend="italic">Erwin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Elmire</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Claudine von Villa Bella.</hi> The carnival of 1788 was of importance to his
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n754/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0754-0731"/> experience. He wrote some scenes of <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust:</hi> especially the scene in the witches’ kitchen was
                    composed in the Borghese gardens. At the end of April he took a sad farewell of
                    Italy, and arrived at Weimar in the middle of June.</p>
                <p>From this time his life takes a new colour. He had learned in Italy not only new
                    principles of art,—not only that a work of art, whatever of Gothic ornament it
                    may possess, must be solid, firm, and simple in its construction as a Grecian
                    temple,—but he had also learned that life itself should be a work of art. He was
                    determined henceforth to be himself, to break the bonds which had confined him
                    and the distractions which had confused him, to possess his soul sacred and
                    inviolable for the purposes of his life. He was relieved of the presidency of
                    the chamber and of the war commission, but in a manner which did him the
                    greatest honour. His relations with Frau von Stein, which had been one reason of
                    his leaving Weimar, began to cool. One of their last friendly meetings was in a
                    journey to Rudolstadt, where Goethe met Schiller. Neither knew the influence
                    which the other would have upon his life. Their relations were those of shyness,
                    and partly even of dislike. Goethe’s friendship with Frau von Stein was to
                    receive a final blow. In the autumn of 1788, walking aimlessly through the park,
                    he met Christiane Vulpius, a young girl who presented him with a petition in
                    favour of her brother. She had golden curling locks, round cheeks, laughing
                    eyes, a neatly rounded figure; she looked, as has been said, “like a young
                    Dionysus.” Goethe took her into his house, and she became his wife in
                    conscience, and the mother of his children. He did not marry her till 1806, when
                    the terrors of the French occupation made him anxious for the position of his
                    eldest son. She had but little education, and he could not take her into
                    society; but she made him a good and loving wife, and her quick mother-wit made
                    her available as an intellectual companion. To these days of early married life
                    belong the Roman elegies, which, although Italian and pagan in form, in colour,
                    and in sensuality, were written in Germany from home experiences.</p>
                <p>We must pass rapidly over the next six years, until Goethe’s genius received a
                    new impulse and direction by his friendship with Schiller, In the spring of 1790
                    he travelled to Venice to meet the duchess Amalia. The Venetian epigrams, still
                    more outspoken in sensuality than the Roman, were the fruit of this journey. In
                    the autumn of the same year he accompanied the duke to Silesia, the first of
                    those military journeys which strike so discordant a note in the harmonious
                    tenor of his existence. The year 1791 offered a quiet contrast to the movement
                    of the year before. He began to take a more special interest in the university
                    at Jena, in which his young friend Fritz von Stein had now entered as a student,
                    and his time was more and more occupied with the study of colours, the least
                    happy and successful of his scientific labours. In the autumn of 1791 Goethe was
                    able to devote himself regularly to a task which had informally occupied his
                    first years in Weimar. The new theatre was completed, and Goethe was made
                    director of it. It was in this capacity that he was best known to the citizens
                    of Weimar. He had the final decision on every detail of piece, scenery, and
                    acting; in later years his seat was in a large arm-chair in the middle of the
                    pit, and applause was scarcely permitted until he gave the signal for it. The
                    German stage owes perhaps as much to Goethe as to Lessing. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >répertoire</hi> of the Weimar theatre was stocked with pieces of solid merit
                    which long held their place. Shakespeare was seriously performed, and the actors
                    were instructed in the delivery of blank verse. Stress was laid on the
                    excellence of the <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> as against the predominance of
                    particular stars. The theatre was considered as a school not only of elevating
                    amusement but of national culture. Goethe wrote the <hi rend="italic">Gross
                    Coj)hia</hi> for the Weimar stage, a piece founded on the history of Cagliostro
                    and the diamond necklace. He was fascinated by the story as a foreboding of the
                    coming horrors of the Revolution. In these events he was destined to take a more
                    active part than he expected. In August 1792 he accompanied the duke to the
                    campaign in the Ardennes. Passing by Frankfort, where he visited his mother, he
                    joined the allied armies at Longwy. He beguiled the tedious siege of Verdun by
                    writing an account of his theory of colours in a leaky tent; and on the
                    disastrous day of Valmy, which he recognized as the birth of a new era, he
                    sought the thickest of the fight that he might experience the dangerous rapture
                    of the cannon-fever He retreated with the Prussian army, spent five weeks with
                    his friend Jacobi at Pempelfort, and on his return to Weimar at the end of the
                    year found that the duke had built him a spacious house in the square where the
                    joint statues of Goethe and Schiller now stand, in eternal memory of their
                    friendship. In 1793 he went with his master to the siege of Mainz. He continued
                    his optical studies during the bombardment, witnessed the marching out of the
                    garrison, and was one of the first to enter the conquered town. He received
                    leave to withdraw, and went to his mother at Frankfort, and persuaded her to
                    sell the old house and its contents, and to provide a more convenient home for
                    her old age. There was some talk of her coming to Weimar. In the autumn of this
                    year the duke left the Prussian service, and Goethe could look forward to a
                    period of peace. He was chiefly occupied with the management of the theatre, and
                    for this he wrote two pieces, both of which had reference to the politics of the
                    time. The <hi rend="italic">Bürgergenercd</hi> is a satire on the Revolution,
                    and was long a stone of offence to Goethe’s friends, who thought that he should
                    have hailed with delight the birth of a new era. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aufgeregten,</hi> left unfinished, sketched the outbreak of the Revolution in a
                    country town, and would have declared the author’s views with greater
                    distinctness. But the feelings of scorn and contempt which he felt for the
                    cowardice, cunning, and perfidy of mankind were expressed in a work of greater
                    magnitude. He had good reason to deplore the misery of the time. His mother’s
                    home in Frankfort was broken up; Schlosser, his brother-in-law, had retired to
                    Auerbach; Jacobi was flying to Holstein. Goethe took the old German epic of <hi
                    rend="italic">Reynard the Fox,</hi> with which he had long been familiar, and
                    which, under the guise of animals, represents the conflicting passions of men,
                    and rewrote it in flowing German hexameters.</p>
                <p>Thus far he had produced but little since his return from Italy. He was now to
                    undergo the most powerful influence which had as yet affected his life. His
                    friendship with Schiller was now to begin, an alliance which, in the closeness
                    of its intimacy and its deep effect on the character of both friends, has
                    scarcely a parallel in literary history. If Schiller was not at this time at the
                    height of his reputation, he had written many of the w orks which have made his
                    name famous. He was ten years younger than Goethe. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Räuber</hi> plays the same part in his literary history as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gotz</hi> plays in that of Goethe. This had been followed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fiesco</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kabale und Liebe.</hi> The second period of
                    Schiller’s life had begun with his friendship with Körner, and his residence in
                    Saxony. Here he wrote the <hi rend="italic">Hymn of Joy,</hi> and completed <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Carlos.</hi> In 1787 he settled at Weimar. He found the place
                    deserted, the duke in the Prussian camp, Goethe in Italy. He applied himself to
                    history, wrote the <hi rend="italic">Revolt of the Netherlands,</hi> and studied
                    the literature and art of Greece. In 1789, mainly upon Goethe’s recommendation,
                    he was made professor of history at the university of Jena, although he was
                    afraid lest the scholars should discover that they knew more history than the
                    teacher.</p>

                <p>He made a successful marriage, and worked seriously at his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Thirty Years'</hi> JFαr. In 1794 Schiller had arranged with the
                    publisher, Cotta of Augsburg, whose name is from this time indissolubly
                    connected with the history of German literature, for the production of a new
                    literary journal. It was to be called the <hi rend="italic">Horen,</hi> and the
                    most distinguished German writers were to contribute to it. Goethe accepted the
                    invitation willingly. The work was designed to mark an epoch in German taste,
                    and it did so. It soon had two thousand subscribers. Among those who promised to
                    contribute were not only Matthisson, Herder, Knebel, Fritz Jacobi, and Gleim,
                    but the brothers Humboldt, the veteran Kant, the youthful Fichte, who had just
                    begun to lecture in Jena, and, at a later period, the brothers Schlegel.
                    Schiller opened the first number of the journal with his letters on the
                    “Aesthetic Education of the Human Race.” Goethe contributed the “Unterhaltungen
                    deutscher Ausgewanderten,” a series of stories told by a number of German
                    emigrants who had been driven to cross the Rhine by the invasion of the French.
                    The most remarkable of these stories is the “Märchen,” a wild and mystic tale,
                    which has been the subject of as much controversy and of as many interpretations
                    as the second part of <hi rend="italic">Faust.</hi> Goethe also published in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Horen</hi> the “Römische Elegien,” the flavour of which even
                    Karl August found a little too strong. The first effect of Schiller’s influence
                    on Goethe was the completion of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Heisters</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrjahre.</hi> He had conceived the plan of the work twenty years
                    before, and the first six books had been written before the Italian journey. It
                    was now finished by the addition of two more books. It stands in the first rank
                    of Goethe’s writings. He has aimed in it to attain to perfect objectivity of
                    tone, to represent men as they are, and to pass no judgment upon them. The hero
                    passes with weak irresolution through a number of ordinary circumstances,
                    apparently the sport of fortune and the plaything of chance, yet all these
                    experiences have their definite result in the training of his character. Like
                    the son of Kish, he goes forth to seek his father’s asses and finds a kingdom.
                    The unearthly charm of the child Mignon, the dark fate which shrouds the aged
                    harper like the doom of (Edipus, the uncertain yearning after a happier home in
                    brighter climes, give a deeper undertone to the prevailing lightness of the
                    story. The style is exquisitely soft and flowing. It has the sweetness and
                    simplicity of <hi rend="italic">Werther,</hi> but is more mellow and more
                    mature. The sixth book is occupied with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bekentnisse</hi><hi rend="italic">einer schonen Seele,</hi> a piece of the
                    autobiography of Goethe’s early friend Fräulein von Klettenberg, altered to suit
                    its new surroundings. The <hi rend="italic">Musen Almanach</hi> for 1796, edited
                    by Schiller, was enriched by some of Goethe’s most exquisite poems— <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Nahe</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Geliebten, Meeres</hi><hi rend="italic">Stille,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Glückliche Fahrt.</hi> The storm of criticism which was aroused by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Horen,</hi> and the little success which, after the first
                    numbers, it met with from the public, determined the two friends to retaliate
                    upon their aggressors. The poems of Martial contain a number of epigrams written
                    in two lines, describing the numberless little presents or <hi rend="italic"
                    >xenia,</hi> which it was customary for friends to exchange at Rome during the
                    time of the Saturnalia. The name was borrowed by the two poets, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Xeηien</hi> was a convenient vehicle for the expression of their
                    opinion on every subject. The newspapers of the day were the first object of
                    attack, but they soon went farther afield. The epigrams were written in
                    Schiller’s rooms at Jena. It is impossible to fix the authorship of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Xenien</hi>; one conceived the idea, the other wrote the lines;
                    one wrote the hexameter, the other the pentameter; they intended the authorship
                    as well as the ownership of the copyright to be one and indivisible.
                    Notwithstanding this, the collection has been broken up. There is no guarantee
                    that the epigrams which appear in the separate works of either poet were really
                    written by the authors to whom they are ascribed; some are reprinted in the
                    works of both; some have remained unprinted altogether. They appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musen Almanach</hi> for 1797, together with the Venetian elegies
                    mentioned above. It is needless to say that they roused the writers whom they
                    attacked to unspeakable fury, and were the occasion of a copious literature. A
                    more solid result of the friendship between the poets was the production of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermann</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dorothea.</hi> It is a German idyll; the story is taken from the sufferings of
                    Lutherans driven out in the early part of the 18th century from the province of
                    Salzburg, but Goethe has given it the character of his own time. He had seen
                    much of the suffering produced by the French Revolution, and he wished this poem
                    to be a reflexion in a tiny mirror of the storms and convulsions of the great
                    world. In its literary form it is a descendant of Voss’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Luise.</hi> It was conceived at Ilmenau in August 1796, and finished in the
                    following spring. Schiller tells us how it was composed with extraordinary ease
                    and rapidity. During nine days Goethe produced 150 lines a day. You have only to
                    shake the tree, as Schiller said, and ripe apples will tumble down about you.
                    The lines thus hastily written underwent a careful revision. Contemporaneous
                    with <hi rend="italic">Hermann</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dorothea</hi> is the production of <hi rend="italic">Wallensteins Lag er</hi>
                    by Schiller, which w as written with the advice and assistance of his brother
                    poet. The completion of this cycle of plays falls two years later.</p>
                <p>The year 1797. is the year of ballads. In his garden house at Jena Schiller
                    worked diligently at this vein, that perhaps for which he was best suited, and
                    in which he most nearly rivals Goethe. Goethe wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Braut</hi><hi rend="italic">von</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Korinth, Gott und</hi><hi rend="italic">die Bayadere,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Zauberlehrling</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the whole
                    collection was published in the <hi rend="italic">Musen Almanach</hi> for 1798.
                    The latter half of this year was occupied with a tour in Switzerland. Before its
                    commencement he visited his mother at Frankfort for the last time, and presented
                    to her his wife and his son. It was a year of extraordinary activity. Besides
                    the ballads and his researches in the morphology of plants and insects, he
                    translated a great part of the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, wrote a
                    number of essays on the question of aesthetics, and worked at his long neglected
                    <hi rend="italic">Faust.</hi> Of this he wrote the dedication, the “Prologue in
                    Heaven,” and the “Golden Marriage of Oberon and Titania”—so powerful was the
                    effect of intellectual sympathy and stimulus. The six years which succeeded
                    Goethe’s return from his third Swiss tour, although they embrace the period in
                    which he and Schiller were in daily co-operation, have left us little of
                    permanent worth from the older poet. On the other hand, they are the years of
                    Schiller’s greatest activity. The great trilogy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallenstein,</hi> perhaps the highest point of Schiller’s genius, was followed
                    by <hi rend="italic">Mama Stuart,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau von
                    Orleans,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Braut</hi><hi rend="italic">von
                    Messina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell.</hi> From the end of 1799
                    Schiller was permanently settledin Weimar; a dramatic school was founded, and
                    the representation of these classical dramas was the glory of the Weimar stage.
                    During these years Goethe was occupied with1Fαwsi, with his researches into the
                    theory of colours and of biological development, with the conduct of the theatre
                    and the practical encouragement of art. In 1798 the <hi rend="italic">Horen</hi>
                    died a natural death, and was succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">Propyläen,</hi>
                    a journal of literature and criticism, which, although it contained many essays
                    by Goethe, never exceeded a circulation cf 300. In the spring 1799 the study of
                    Homer incited Goethe to sketch a long epic poem on the subject of Achilles.
                    Schiller did his best to encourage the work. The first canto was rapidly
                    completed, but it had no successor. Goethe contented himself with translating
                    the works of others, and prepared the <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tancred</hi> of Voltaire for the Leipsic stage. In the first <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0756-0733"/> days of the new century he suffered a dangerous
                    attack of scarlatina. His friends feared for his life. Frau von &gt;Stein
                    recalled her forgotten friendship, and showed kindness to his son. After his
                    recovery he sketched out what was the most important work of these years, a
                    trilogy on the subject of the French Revolution; of this only the first part,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Natürliche Tochter,</hi> was completed. The story was a
                    true one of a princess of the French house of Conti. The play is written with
                    the full beauty of Goethe’s style, and some passages and effects are worthy of
                    his highest genius. But as a whole it fails. It has the quality, which in a
                    drama must be a fault, so characteristic of Goethe’s later writing, of too great
                    universality of treatment. The characters are not living beings but
                    abstractions, and the language is vague and general rather than clear and
                    defined. The play was performed at Weimar on April 2, 1803. Two masterpieces of
                    Schiller—the <hi rend="italic">Braut</hi><hi rend="italic">von Messina</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau von Orleans—</hi> preceded and followed it by a
                    few weeks. At the end of this year Madame de Stael arrived in Weimar accompanied
                    by Benjamin Constant. She had heard of the fame of this new Parnassus, and she
                    was bent on proclaiming the intellectual superiority of Germany to the world.
                    Goethe at first fled from her, as Byron did at a later period. He hid himself in
                    Jena, but was recalled by order of the duke. The result of the conversations in
                    the salons of Weimar is contained in her book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">Allemagne.</hi> In March she was suddenly
                    recalled by the death of her father, the minister Necker. Goethe was at this
                    time the centre to which the most distinguished men of all kinds in Germany
                    naturally turned. He was most intimate with Zelter the musician, with whom he
                    maintained a full correspondence; with Wilhelm von Humboldt, the
                    statesman-scholar; with F. A. Wolf, the founder of the science of philology;
                    with Gottfried Hermann, the best authority on Greek metres. But the friendship
                    which was worth all these was soon to be severed. In the beginning of 1805
                    Goethe was convinced that either he or Schiller would die in that year. In
                    January they were both seized with illness; Schiller had finished his <hi
                    rend="italic">Phädra</hi> and begun to work at his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demetrius.</hi> Goethe was translating the <hi rend="italic">Neveu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Rameau</hi> of Diderot. Schiller was the first to recover, and
                    visiting Goethe in his sick room, fell on his neck and kissed him with intense
                    emotion. On April 29 they saw each other for the last time. Schiller was on his
                    way to the theatre whither Goethe was too ill to accompany him. They parted at
                    the door of Schiller’s house. Schiller died on the evening of the 9th of May. No
                    one dared to tell Goethe the sad news, but he saw in the faces of those who
                    surrounded him thatSchiller must be very ill. Onthe morrowof Schiller’s death,
                    when his wife entered his room, he said, “Is it not true that Schiller was very
                    ill yesterday?” She began to sob. He then cried, “He is dead !” “Thou hast
                    spoken it thyself,” she answered. Once more he cried, “He is dead!” and turning
                    aside covered his weeping eyes with his hands. He at first intended to have
                    completed <hi rend="italic">Demetrius</hi> as a memorial of his friend, but a
                    happier inspiration was to arrange a performance of Schiller’s great poem of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Bell,</hi> and to crown it by an epilogue. Since that time
                    Schiller and Goethe have been inseparable in the minds of their countrymen, and
                    have reigned as twin stars in the literary firmament. If Schiller does not hold
                    the first place, it is at least true that he is more beloved, although Goethe
                    may be more admired. It would be invidious to separate them. But it is evident
                    that the best fruits of Schiller’s muse were produced when he was most closely
                    under Goethe’s influence, and the foreign student of German culture has ground
                    for believing that at some future time the glory of the lesser luminary will be
                    absorbed in that of the greater, and the name of Goethe will represent alone and
                    unrivalled the literature of his age and country.</p>
                <p>Schiller was happy in the occasion of his death. He did not see the troubles
                    which immediately afterwards burst upon Thuringia. On October 14, 1806, the
                    battle of Jena was fought. The court had fled from Weimar; only the duchess
                    Louise remained. In the evening of the defeat Weimar was plundered by the
                    conquering troops. Many of Goethe’s friends lost everything they possessed. His
                    property and perhaps his life was saved by the firmness of Christiane, and
                    afterwards by the billeting of Marshal Augereau in his house. On the 15th
                    Napoleon entered the town, but Goethe did not go to see him. The duchess
                    obtained her husband’s pardon by her entreaties. It was not till the autumn of
                    1808 that Napoleon and Goethe, perhaps the two greatest men then living in
                    Europe, met and conversed. It was at the congress of Erfurt, where the
                    sovereigns and princes of Europe were assembled. Goethe’s presence was commanded
                    by the duke. He was attracted at least as much by the prospect of seeing Talma
                    as of meeting Napoleon. He was invited to an audience on October 2; Talleyrand,
                    Berthier, and Savary were present. The emperor sat at a large round table eating
                    his breakfast. He beckoned Goethe to approach him, and said to him, “Vous êtes
                    un homme !” He asked how old he was, expressed his wonder at the freshness of
                    his appearance, said that he had read <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> through
                    seven times, and made some acute remarks on the management of the plot. Then,
                    after an interruption, he said that tragedy ought to be the school of kings and
                    peoples; that there was no subject worthier of treatment than the death of
                    Caesar, which Voltaire had treated insufficiently. A great poet would have given
                    prominence to Caesar’s plans for the regeneration of the w orld, and shown what
                    a loss mankind had suffered by his murder. He invited Goethe to Paris; that was
                    the centre of great movements; there he would find subjects worthy of his skill.
                    They parted with mutual admiration. The bust of Napoleon was a prominent
                    ornament in Goethe’s study.</p>
                <p>In the same year, 1808, an edition of Goethe’s works in thirteen volumes was
                    published by Cotta at Tübingen. It is remarkable as containing the first part of
                    <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> in its complete form. The principal portions of the
                    drama had already been published as a fragment in 1790. It had then attracted
                    but little attention. Heyne wrote of it—“There are fine passages in it, but with
                    them there are such things as only he could give to the world who takes other
                    men to be blockheads.” Wieland and Schiller were apparently dissatisfied with
                    it. It had perhaps the appearance of patchwork, as it was made up of fragments
                    which had been written at very different periods of his life. The idea of
                    writing <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> seems to have come to Goethe in his
                    earliest manhood. He was brooding over it at the same time with <hi
                    rend="italic">G'otz von Berlichingeη,</hi> but at Strasburg he spoke to Herder
                    of neither. He apparently began to write it down at the same time as <hi
                    rend="italic">Werther</hi> in 1774, and we find mention of its progress in the
                    two following years; indeed, all the important parts of the fragment w hich
                    appeared in 1790 were known to Jacobi before 1776. He took the work with him to
                    Italy, where he added little to it except the scene in the witches’ kitchen. The
                    dedication, the “Prologue in Heaven,” which presents to the reader the idea of
                    the whole work, the prelude on the stage copied from the Indian drama, the
                    lyrical intermezzo, the scene with Wagner before the city gate, and the scene
                    with Mephistopheles in the study were written before 1800. In that year he was
                    busy with Helena for the second part, and he added nothing afterwards to the
                    first except the “Walpurgis Night” and the scene of Valentine’s death. <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust</hi> justly stands at the head of all Goethe’s works, and it
                    deserves a very high place among the best works of every age. Founded on a
                    well-known popular tale, indebted for its interest and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n757/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0757-0734"/> pathos to incidents of universal experience, it
                    deals with the deepest problems which can engage the mind of man. In this
                    combination of qualities it is perhaps superior to any one of Shakespeare’s
                    plays. The plot is as simple and as well known to the audience as the plot of a
                    Greek tragedy. The innocence and the fall of Gretchen appeal to every heart; the
                    inward struggles of Faust, like those of Hamlet, and the antagonism of the
                    sensual and moral principles, interest the reader just in proportion as his own
                    mind and nature have been similarly stirred. Each line is made to stand for
                    eternity; not a word is thrown away; the poem has entered as a whole into the
                    mind and thought of modern Germany; nearly every expression has become a
                    household word. Characters are sketched in a single scene; Valentine lives for
                    us as clearly as Faust himself Deeper meanings are opened up at every reading,
                    and the next age will discover much in it which is concealed from this. Goethe,
                    writing of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> in his eightieth year, says with truth,
                    “The commendation which the poem has received far and near may be perhaps owing
                    to this quality, that it permanently preserves the period of development of a
                    human soul which is tormented by all that afflicts mankind, shaken also by all
                    that disturbs it, repelled by all that it finds repellent, and made happy by all
                    that it desires. The author is at present far removed from such conditions; the
                    world likewise has to some extent other struggles to undergo; nevertheless the
                    state of man, in joy and sorrow, remains very much the same, and the latest born
                    will still find cause to acquaint himself with what has been enjoyed and
                    suffered before him in order to adapt himself to that which awaits him.”</p>
                <p>In 1809 he finished <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Wahlverwandtschaften</hi> (The Elective Affinities), a story which is always
                    cited to prove the immoral tendency of his works. A married couple, Edward and
                    Charlotte, are thrown into constant companionship with two unmarried persons,
                    the Captain and Ottilie. A cross attraction takes place similar to that which is
                    often seen in chemical experiments. Edward unites himself with Ottilie,
                    Charlotte with the Captain. The psychological changes by which this result is
                    produced are portrayed with a masterly hand. The moral may be held by some to
                    exalt the preponderance of fatality in human affairs, and the uselessness of
                    contending against irresistible circumstances. Others may believe that the story
                    is intended to show the disastrous calamities which may be wrought by a weak and
                    self-indulgent will. Ottilie, though she cannot resist her passion, has strength
                    enough to starve herself to death; Edward is the prototype of Arthur Donnithorne
                    and Tito Melema. The work is replete with earnest purpose and terrible
                    warning.</p>
                <p>In 1810 Goethe finished the printing of his <hi rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi>
                    (Theory of Colours), a work which had occupied his mind ever since his journey
                    to Italy. His theories were rejected and disregarded by his contemporaries, but
                    he left them with confidence to the judgment of posterity. Goethe’s labours in
                    this domain fall into two natural divisions—one in which he tries to prove that
                    the hypotheses of Newton are unsatisfactory, and another in which he promulgates
                    a theory of his own. In his first work, published in 1791 and 1792, he describes
                    with great accuracy and liveliness the experiments which he has made. They
                    consist chiefly of the appearances presented by white discs on a black ground,
                    black discs on a white ground, and coloured discs on a black or white ground
                    when seen through a prism. There are two points which he considers fatal to
                    Newton’s theory,—that the centre of a broad white surface remains white when
                    seen through a prism, and that even a black streak on a white ground can be
                    entirely decomposed into colours. The scientific friends to whom he communicated
                    these observations assured him that there was nothing in them opposed toNewton’s
                    theory,—that they were even confirmations of it. He would not be convinced, and
                    took no pains to acquire that exact knowledge of mathematics and geometrical
                    reasoning without which the more abstruse problems of physical optics could not
                    be intelligible. He went on further to formulate a theory of his own. His views
                    on the subject are contained in their shortest form in a letter addressed to
                    Jacobi from the camp at Marienburg in July 1793. They are divided into six
                    heads, of which the following is an abstract. (1.) Light is the simplest matter
                    we have knowledge of, the least capable of analysis, the most homogeneous. It is
                    not a compound body. (2.) Least of all is it compounded of coloured lights.
                    Every coloured light is darker than colourless light. Brightness cannot be
                    compounded of darkness. (3.) Inflexion, refraction, reflexion, are three
                    conditions under which we often observe apparent colours, but they are rather
                    occasions for their appearance than the cause of it. (4.) There are only two
                    pure colours, blue and yellow; red may be regarded as a property of both of
                    them. There are two mixed colours, green and purple; the restare gradations of
                    these colours, and are not pure. (5.) Colourless light cannot be produced out of
                    coloured lights, nor white from coloured pigments. (6.) The colours which appear
                    to us arise solely out of a modification of the light. The colours are excited
                    in the light, not developed out of the light. These views he afterwards extended
                    and explained, but very slightly modified. In Goethe’s opinion, yellow was light
                    seen through a thickened medium; blue was darkness seen through an illuminated
                    medium; all other colours were derived from these two. The theory of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Farbenlehre</hi> has not yet received the recognition which Goethe
                    anticipated for it. In his own day he had sρme adherents,—the most distinguished
                    perhaps was the philosopher Hegel, whose views, however, of natural philosophy
                    have caused many inquirers to recoil from his theory of metaphysics. Goethe
                    complained that no physicist believed in him, and as that is still true in an
                    age which has been devoted more than any other to physical inquiries, we may
                    conclude that the principle upon which his theories are based is radically
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>The year 1809, in which <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Wahlverwandtschaften</hi> was written, was for Goethe the beginning of a new
                    era. He was then fresher and brighter than he had been for ten years before. He
                    had lived through a troubled period of oppressive sorrow. The death of
                    »Schiller, the violation of his beloved Weimar, the deaths of the duchess Amalia
                    and of his mother, his own bodily and mental sufferings, had given a tone of
                    sadness to his poetry. As if to put the finishing stroke to the efforts of his
                    life, he married the mother of his children, arranged and published his
                    collected works, and completed his theory of colours. The unfinished drama of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> is a symbol of this time. The part which is
                    completed refers only to past experiences of sadness; the continuation was to
                    have lifted the curtain of future hope.</p>
                <p>It was natural at the beginning of a new course of life that Goethe should write
                    an account of his past existence. The study of his collected poems made it
                    apparent to him how necessary it was to furnish a key by which they might be
                    understood. These various causes led to the composition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi> (Poetry and Truth), an autobiographical history of
                    the poet’s life from his birth till his settlement at Weimar. This work is the
                    cause of much embarrassment to the poet’s biographers. Where it ought to be the
                    most trustworthy source of information, it is most misleading. It is probable
                    that Goethe intended it to be an accurate and circumstantial account of his
                    life. But the inner life of an individual is more clear to him than the outer.
                    The stages of our self-development are better remembered than the exact
                    circumstances which produced them, still less than the order of time in which
                    they followed each other. Goethe <pb break="no"

                    forgotten. But he was so conscious that imagination would play a large part in
                    the composition that in the title he gave poetry the precedence before truth.
                    The indefatigable industry of German investigation has laid open before us every
                    detail of the poet’s life and every phase of his feeling. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dichtung und Wahrheit,</hi> if it has lost its rank as a history, still keeps
                    its place as a classic. The simple loving delineation of the childhood of genius
                    is as fresh as ever, and is of more universal interest from being less
                    particular. The first five books of this autobiography appeared in 1811, the
                    next five in 1812, the third instalment at Easter 1814, and the conclusion after
                    Goethe’s death. The period during which this was his principal work witnessed
                    the greatest political event of the first half of our century, the rising of the
                    German people against the power of Napoleon. In this Goethe took no share, and
                    with it he apparently felt little sympathy. He made no impassioned orations to
                    his countrymen like Fichte; he wrote no inspiring lays like Körner. The ballads
                    which he composed in 1813 are harmless enough,— <hi rend="italic">Der wandelnde
                    Glocke, Der getreue Eckhart, Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Todteηtaηz.</hi> He saw
                    Stein and Arndt at Dresden in 1813, but disappointed them by his impassive
                    manner. He said to Körner’s father at the same time, “Yes, shake your chains!
                    The man is too great for you. You will not break them, but only drive them
                    deeper into your flesh.” The reasons for this apparent coldness are perhaps more
                    simple than they appear at first sight. Goethe was a man of thought rather than
                    of action. Although a fair portion of his long life was given to the practical
                    business of his adopted country, his heart was always in speculation or artistic
                    production. While inspecting mines he was spinning theories of geological
                    formation; while working for the war commission he gladly ran away to the castle
                    of Dornburg to bury himself amongst his deserted papers. The pressure of court
                    business at Weimar drove him to the solitude of Italy. In the defiles of the
                    Argonne, and in the trenches before Mainz, he was scheming and arranging his
                    theory of colours. A bombardment was valued by him less as an attack upon the
                    enemy than as a series of interesting experiments in optics. Added to this
                    natural indifference to the details of human affairs was his belief in the
                    predominance of force, and in the necessary evolution of the history of the
                    world. Napoleon was to him the greatest living depository of power. Nations,
                    whether conquered or victorious, separated or united, obeyed a common law
                    against which individual will strove in vain. Goethe was thus incapacitated for
                    politics, both by his qualities and his defects. This habit of abstract
                    contemplation grew upon him in later life. Those who condemn him on this ground
                    should remember that he hailed in no grudging spirit the formation of a united
                    Germany, and that his works have been the most potent agency in making all
                    Germans feel that they are one. Few would wish to exchange the self-conflict of
                    <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> or even the wayward wanderings of <hi
                    rend="italic">Heister,</hi> for the hectic extravagance of Körner or the
                    unsubstantial rhetoric of Posa.</p>
                <p>It was hardly to be expected that at the age of sixty-five Goethe should strike
                    out new lines of poetical activity. However, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >West-'ostliche Divan,</hi> he made the first attempt to transplant Eastern
                    poetry to a German soil, and set an example which has been followed by Heine and
                    Mirza Schaffy. In 1811 he first became acquainted with the works of Hafiz in
                    Hammer’s translation. At a time when North and South and West were splitting in
                    sunder, when thrones were breaking up and empires trembling, he sought a willing
                    refuge in the restoring fountain of the Eastern poet. The book <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timur</hi> has an obvious reference to the expedition of Napoleon in Russia,
                    but the large majority of the poems are amatory, and are addressed to an
                    imaginary Suleika, whose name is given to one of the books. Once more in his old
                    age Goethe came under the sovereignty of a woman. She was Marianne von Willemer,
                    the newly married wife of a Frankfort banker, Jacob von Willemer, who was an old
                    friend of Goethe’s and of his brother-in-law Schlosser. Goethe made her
                    acquaintance in a journey which he took in the Rhine country with Sulpiz
                    Boiserée, who had succeeded in interesting Goethe in early German art, a subject
                    to which he was himself devoted. The correspondence between Goethe and Marianne
                    was published in 1877. It extends almost to the day of his death, and includes
                    letters from Eckermann giving an account of his last moments. Not only were most
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Divan</hi> poems addressed to Suleika, but several of
                    those included in the collection are by Marianne herself, and will bear
                    comparison with those of Goethe, In these poems the Oriental form is not very
                    strictly observed. The fondness of the Orientals for the repetition of single
                    rhymes is not attended to, and if sometimes remembered is soon forgotten. Their
                    Eastern colour depends rather on the suggestion of Eastern scenery and the
                    introduction of Eastern names, This, however, gives the poet a greater licence
                    to levity, to fatalism, and to passion than would have been possible in poems of
                    a purely German character.</p>
                <p>The last tλvelve years of Goethe’s life, when he had passed his seventieth
                    birthday, were occupied by his criticisms on the literature of foreign
                    countries, by the <hi rend="italic">Wanderfahne,</hi> and the second part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust.</hi> He was the literary dictator of Germany and of Europe.
                    He took but little interest in the direction in which the younger German school
                    was moving, and was driven to turn his eyes abroad. He conceived an intense
                    admiration for Byron, which was increased by his early death. Byron appears as
                    Euphorion in the second part of <hi rend="italic">Faust.</hi> He also recognized
                    the greatness of Scott, and was one of the first to send a greeting to the
                    Italian Mazzini. He conceived the idea of a worldliteraturetranscending the
                    narrow limits of race and country, which should unite all nations in harmony of
                    feeling and aspiration. German writers claim that his design has been realized,
                    and the literature of every age and country can be studied in a tongue which
                    Goethe had made rich, flexible, and serviceable for the purpose. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Wänderjahre,</hi> although it contains some of Goethe’s most
                    beautiful conceptions, The Flight into Egypt, The Description of the Pedagogic
                    Province, The Parable of the Three Reverences, is yet an ill-assorted collection
                    of all kinds of writings, old and new. Its author never succeeded in giving it
                    form or coherency, and his later style, beautiful as it is, becomes in these
                    years vague and abstract. Still without this work we should not be acquainted
                    with the full richness and power of his mind.</p>
                <p>The second part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> has "been a battlefield of
                    controversy since its publication, and demands fuller attention. Its fate may be
                    compared with that of the latest works of Beethoven, For a long time it was
                    regarded as impossible to understand, and as not worth understanding, the
                    production of a great artist whose faculties had been impaired by age. By
                    degrees it has, by careful labour, become intelligible to us, and the conviction
                    is growing that it is the deepest and most important work of the author’s life.
                    Its composition cannot be called an after-thought. There is no doubt that the
                    poet finished at the age of eighty the plan which he had conceived sixty years
                    before. The work in its entirety may be described as the first part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust</hi> “writ large.” This is a picture of the macrocosm of
                    society as that was of the microcosm of the individual. The parallelism between
                    the two dramas is not perfect, but it reveals itself more and more clearly to a
                    patient study. Some points of this similarity have been well expressed by
                    Rosenkranz (quoted by Bayard Taylor) :—“Both parts are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n759/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0759-0736"/> symmetrical in their structure. The first moves
                    with deliberate swiftness from heaven through the world to hell; the second
                    returns therefrom through the world to heaven. Between the two lies the
                    emancipation of Faust from the torment of his conscious guilt, lies his Lethe,
                    his assimilation of the past. In regard to substance, the first part begins
                    religiously, becomes metaphysical, and terminates ethically; the second part
                    begins ethically, becomes aesthetic, and terminates religiously. In one, love
                    and knowledge are confronted with each other; in the other, practical activity
                    and art, the ideal of the beautiful. In regard to form, the first part advances
                    from the hymnal shout to monologue and dialogue; the second part from monologue
                    and dialogue to the dithyrambic, closing with the hymn, which here glorifies not
                    alone the Lord and His uncomprehended lofty works, but the human in the process
                    of its union with the divine, through redemption and atonement.” The first act,
                    with its varied scenes of country, castle, garden, galleries, and halls, answers
                    to the two prologues of the first part; the second act introduces us again to
                    Faust’s study and his familiar Wagner. The classical Walpurgis Night has its
                    prototype in the first part. The third act is devoted to Helena, who is the
                    heroine of the second part as Gretchen is of the first. The marriage of Faust
                    and Helena typifies the union of the classical and romantic schools, and their
                    child is Euphorion, who is symbolical of Byron. In the fourth act Faust is
                    raised instead of being degraded by his union with Helena. He wishes for a
                    sphere of beneficent activity, and obtains it by war. The fifth act is devoted
                    to the complete regeneration of the soul of Faust. Even the sight of all that he
                    has accomplished does not satisfy him. It is not until he is blind to outward
                    objects that one moment of divine rapture reveals to him the continuance of his
                    work in coming generations, and convinces him that he has not lived in vain. In
                    this one moment of supreme happiness he dies. The struggle for the possession of
                    Faust’s soul, indicated in the first part, is fully elaborated in the second.
                    Mephistopheles is shown to have worked out the good in spite of himself, and
                    Margaret appears transfigured as the revelation to man of the divine love.</p>
                <p>With the completion of Faust, Goethe felt that the work of his life was
                    accomplished. He still continued to work with regularity. He ordered and
                    arranged his writings, he laboured at his <hi rend="italic">Tages-und
                    Jahresheften,</hi> an autobiographical journal of his life. He bated not one jot
                    of heart or hope, and took the liveliest interest in every movement of
                    literature and science. When the news of the July Revolution of 1830 reached
                    Weimar, Goethe was excited beyond his wont, not on account of the triumph of
                    liberal principles, but because the controversy between Cuvier and Geoffrey St
                    Hilaire had been decided in favour of the latter. Still he had much to darken
                    his latter days. His old friends were falling fast around him. His wife had died
                    in 181G, after a union of thirty years. He felt her loss bitterly. The duchess
                    Amalia had died eight years before, not long after the death of his own mother.
                    He now had to undergo bitterer experiences when he was less able to bear them.
                    Frau von Stein, with whom he had renewed his friendship if not his love, died in
                    January 1827; and in June 1828 he lost the companion of his youth, the
                    grand-duke Karl August, who died suddenly, away from Weimar, on his return from
                    a journey. Goethe received the news with outward calmness, but said
                    forebodingly, “Now it is all over,” and went to mourn and labour at the castle
                    of Dornburg, where everything reminded him of the days of their early
                    friendship. The duchess Louise survived her husband till February 1830. When
                    Goethe died in 1832 none of the old Weimar set were left except Knebel, who
                    lived two years longer. A greater blow than these was the death of his only son,
                    whom, in spite of his moral weakness, his father deeply loved. He died at Rome
                    in October 1830, and is buried close by the pyramid of Caius Cestius, where
                    Goethe himself once desired to be laid. We have a full account of the last nine
                    years of Goethe’s life from the writings of Eckermann, who became his secretary
                    in 1823, lived with him till his death, and has noted down his conversations and
                    his habits with the minuteness and fidelity of a Boswell.</p>
                <p>We must pass on to the closing scene. On Thursday, March 15, 1832, he spent his
                    last cheerful and happy day. He was visited by the grand-duchess and other
                    friends. He awoke the next morning with a chill. From this he gradually
                    recovered, and on Monday was so much better that he designed to begin his
                    regular work on the next day. But in the middle of the night he woke up with a
                    deathly coldness, which extended from his hands over his body, and which it took
                    many hours to subdue. It then appeared that the lungs were attacked, and that
                    there was no hope of his recovery. Goethe did not anticipate death. He sat fully
                    clothed in his arm-chair, made attempts to reach his study, spoke confidently of
                    his recovery, and of the walks he would take in the fine April days. His
                    daughter-in-law Ottilie tended him faithfully. On the morning of the 22d his
                    strength gradually left him. He sat slumbering in his armchair holding Ottilie’s
                    hand. Her name was constantly on his lips. His mind occasionally wandered, at
                    one time to his beloved Schiller, at another to a fair female head with black
                    curls, some passion of his youth. His last words were an order to his servant to
                    open the second shutter to let in more light. After this he traced with his
                    forefinger letters in the air. At half-past eleven in the day he drew himself,
                    without any sign of pain, into the left comer of his arm-chair, and went so
                    peacefully to sleepthat it waslong before the watchers knew that his spirit was
                    really gone. He is buried in the grand-ducal vault, where the bones of Schiller
                    are also laid.</p>
                <p>Goethe differs from all other great writers, except perhaps Milton, in this
                    respect, that his works cannot be understood without a knowledge of his life,
                    and that his life is in itself a work of art, greater than any work which it
                    created. This renders a long and circumstantial biography a necessity to all who
                    would study the poet seriously. At the same time he is so great that we are even
                    now scarcely sufficiently removed from him to be able to form a correct judgment
                    of his place in literary history. He is not only the greatest poet of Germany;
                    he is one of the greatest poets of all ages. Posterity must decide his exact
                    precedence in that small and chosen company which contains the names of Homer,
                    Dante, and Shakespeare. He was the apostle of self-culture. Always striving
                    after objective truth, and sometimes attaining to it, he exhibited to the world
                    every phase of his plastic mind in turn, and taught both by precept and example
                    the husbandry of the soul. The charge of selfishness so often brought against
                    him cannot be maintained. His nature responded to every influence of passing
                    emotion. Like a delicate harp, it was silent if not touched, and yet gave its
                    music to every wooing of the wilful wind. The charge of unsympathetic coldness
                    roused the deep indignation of those who knew him best. He learned by sad
                    experience that the lesson of life is to renounce. Rather than cavil at his
                    statuesque repose, we should learn to admire the self-conflict and selfcommand
                    which moulded the exuberance of his impulsive nature into monumental symmetry
                    and proportion. His autobiography has done him wrong. It is the story not of his
                    life, but of his recollections. He needs no defence, nothing but sympathetic
                    study. As Homer concentrated in himself the spirit of antiquity, Dante of the
                    Middle Ages, and Shakespeare of the Renaissance, so Goethe is the representative
                    of the modern spirit, the prophet of mankind under new circumstances and new
                    conditions, the appointed teacher of ages yet unb <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>

                    literature would fill a very large space. We must content ourselves with an
                    indication of the principal sources from which a knowledge of his life may be
                    derived. The most important source of all is his own works. The <hi

                    rend="italic">Goethes</hi><hi rend="italic">Briefe</hi><hi rend="italic">an
                    seiner</hi><hi rend="italic">Leipziger Freunde.</hi> Schöll and A. Hoher have
                    collected the letters of the Strasburg period. Goethe’s correspondence with
                    Schiller and with Zelter was published during his lifetime. Besides these we
                    have his letters to Herder, Merck, Kestner and Lotte, Lavater, Knebel, Countess
                    Stolberg, Jacobi, Karl August, and Frau von Stein. Lately have appeared his
                    letters to Marianne von Willemer, and some of those addressed to J. G.
                    Schlosser. We are without his letters to Behrisch, Lerse, and Zimmermann; and we
                    have only a few of those addressed to Horn and Sophie La Roche. Goethe’s real
                    letters to Bettina von Arnim are in the main unpublished; those which bear the
                    name have been largely falsified, but have a substratum of truth. We have also a
                    few, volumes of Goethe’s scientific correspondence, published by his
                    descendants. Help to the understanding of his poetry is given by the letters of
                    Wieland, Caroline Flachsland, and his Weimar friends. The letters addressed to
                    him by Frau von Stein exist, but have not been made public. The first life of
                    Goethe was published by Döring in 1828, of which a second enlarged edition
                    appeared after the poet’s death in 1833. Then followed Viehoff in 4 volumes,
                    1847-1853. The best life of Goethe is that of Schäfer, which appeared first in
                    1851, and the third edition of which dates from 1877. It is contained in two
                    volumes of moderate size, and is written with scarcely a superfluous word. The
                    account of Goethe and Schiller by Karl Goedeke in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grundriss der Deutschen Dichtung</hi> is admirable, and so is the little book
                    <hi rend="italic">Goethes</hi><hi rend="italic">Leben und Schriften,</hi>
                    published by him in 1874, The life of Goethe has been popularized in England by
                    G. H. Lewes, in a work which is as much read in German as in English. A complete
                    biography of Goethe cannot be written until the archives of the Goethe Haus at
                    Weimar are thrown open for consultation. The knowledge of Goethe’s works in
                    England is due as much as anything else to the writings of Thomas Carlyle. The
                    commentaries on Goethe’s works are endless in number. The most active labourer
                    in this field has been IT. Diintze, who has left no side of Goethe’s activity
                    and no period of his life unexplored. We must also mention the brilliant
                    lectures on Goethe by Hermann Grimm (Berlin, 1877), and the excellent sketch of
                    his life and works published by A. Hayward in 1878. The following works deserve
                    particular mention :—</p>
