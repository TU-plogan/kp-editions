                        rend="italic                     smallcaps"> (c.</hi> 1606-1676), the
                    greatest hymnwriter of Germany, if not indeed of Europe, was born of a good
                    middle-class family at Gräfenhainichen, a small town on the railway between
                    Halle and Wittenberg, in 1606 or 1607,∙—some authorities, indeed, give the date
                    March 12, 1607, but neither the year nor the day is accurately known. His
                    education appears to have been retarded by the troubles of the period, the
                    Thirty Years’ War having begun about the time he reached his twelfth year. After
                    completing his studies for the church he is known to have lived for some years
                    at Berlin as tutor in the family of an advocate named Berthold, whose daughter
                    he subsequently married, on receiving his first ecclesiastical appointment at
                    Mittelwald (a small town in the neighbourhood of Berlin) in 1651. In 1657 he
                    accepted an invitation as “diaconus” to the Nicolaikirche of Berlin; but, in
                    consequence of his uncompromising Lutheranism in refusing to accept the elector
                    Frederick William’s “syncretistic” edict of 1664, he was deprived in 1666.
                    Though absolved from submission and restored to office early in the following
                    year, on the petition of the citizens, his conscience did not allow him to
                    retain a post wlιich, as it appeared to him, could only be held on condition of
                    at least a tacit repudiation of the Formula Concordiae, and for upwards of a
                    year he lived in Berlin without fixed employment. In 1668 he was appointed
                    archdeacon of Lübben in the duchy of Saxe-Merseburg, where, after a somewhat
                    sombre ministry of eight years, he died on the 7th of June 1676. Many of his
                    best known hymns were originally published in various church hymn-books, as for
                    example in that for Brandenburg -which appeared in 1658; others first saw the
                    light in Johann Cruger’s <hi rend="italic">Geistliche Kirchenmelodien</hi>
                    (1649) and <hi rend="italic">Praxis</hi><hi rend="italic">Pietatis Melica</hi>
