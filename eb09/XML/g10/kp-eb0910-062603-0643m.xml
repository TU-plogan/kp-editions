                    name given to a mass of ice, having its origin in the hollows of mountains where
                    perpetual snow accumulates, but which makes its way down towards the lower
                    valleys, where it gradually melts, until it terminates exactly where the
                    melting, due to the contact of the warmer air, earth, and rain of the valley,
                    compensates for the bodily descent of the ice from the snow reservoirs of the
                    higher mountains.</p>
                <p>The diminution of temperature as we ascend the slopes of mountains, is indicated
                    by successive zones of vegetation, and finally by the occurrence of perpetual
                    snow (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> p. 280). It was first shown by
                    Baron Humboldt and Von Buch that the limit of perpetual snow depends principally
                    on the temperature of the summer, and not upon that of the whole year.</p>

                <p>A glacier usually protrudes into a valley far below the limit of perpetual snow,
                    and terminates amidst a wilderness of stones borne down upon its surface and
                    deposited by its fusion. This earthy and rocky rubbish is termed moraine matter,
                    and has already been described <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geology,</hi> p. 281).
                    Lying in front of the lower end of a glacier, it marks in a characteristic and
                    certain manner the greatest limit of extension which the glacier has at any one
                    time attained. Sometimes a glacier is seen to have withdrawn very far within its
                    old limits, leaving a prodigious barren waste of stones in advance of it, which,
                    being devoid of soil, nourishes not one blade of grass. At other times the
                    glacier pushes forward its margin beyond the limit which it has ever reached (at
                    least within the memory of man), tears up the ground with its icy ploughshare,
                    and shoves forward the yielding turf in wrinkled folds, uprooting trees, moving
                    vast rocks, and scattering the walls of dwellinghouses in fragments before its
                    irresistible onward march.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Such a sudden and disastrous increase took place in many of the glaciers of
                    Switzerland and Savoy in 1818 (occasioning the catastrophe of the Val de
                    Bagnes), and in those of the Bergenstift in Norway about 1740. The retreat of a
                    glacier far witinn its old moraines is well exemplified in most of the glaciers
                    of the latter country, and especially in that of Nygaard.</p></note></p>
                <p>The lower end of a glacier is usually steep,—sometimes with a dome-shaped
                    unbroken outline, more frequently broken up by intersecting cracks into
                    prismatic masses which the continued action of the sun and rain sharpen into
                    pyramids, often assuming (as in the glacier of Bossons at Chamouni) grotesque or
                    beautiful forms. From a vault in the green-blue ice, more or less perfectly
                    formed each summer, the torrent issues which represents the natural drainage of
                    the valley, derived partly from land springs, partly from the fusion of the ice.
                    The united or crevassed condition of the glacier generally depends almost
                    entirely on the slope of its bed. If it incline rapidly, numerous transverse
                    fissures are formed from the imperfect yielding of the ice during its forced
                    descent along its uneven channel. These cracks often extend for hundreds of
                    yards, and may be hundreds of feet in depth; but their greatest depth is not
                    accurately known, since they are rarely quite vertical. In many cases, however,
                    the crevasses are comparatively few in number, and the glacier may be readily
                    traversed in all directions. This is especially the case if a glacier of
                    considerable dimensions meets with any contraction in its course. The ice is
                    embayed and compressed, and its slope lessens, just as in the case of a river
                    when it nears a similar contraction preceding a fall. Such level and generally
                    traversable spaces may be found about the middle regions of the Mer de Glace,
                    the lower glacier of Grindelwald, the lower glacier of the Aar, and in many
                    other cases. The last-named glacier is perhaps the most remarkably even and
                    accessible of any in Switzerland. The slope of its surface is in many places
                    only 3°. The Pasterzen glacier in Carinthia is even less inclined. It is in such
                    portions of a glacier that we commonly find internal cascades, or “moulins.”
                    These arise from the surface water being collected into a considerable mass by a
                    long course over its unbroken surface, and then precipitated with violence into
                    the first fissure it meets with. The descending cascade keeps open its channel,
                    which finally loses the form of a fissure, presenting that of an open shaft,
                    often of immense depth.</p>
                <p>Nearly connected in their origin with the internal cascades are the “gravel
                    cones,” occasionally seen on the surface of glaciers, which appear to be formed
                    in this way. A considerable amount of earthy matter derived by the superficial
                    water-runs from the moraine accumulates in heaps in the inequalities of the ice,
                    or at the bottom of the “moulins.” As the glacier surface wastes by the action
                    of the sun and rain, these heaps are brought to the surface, or rather the
                    general surface is depressed to their level. If the earthy mass be considerable,
                    the ice beneath is protected from the radiation of the sun and from the violent
                    washing of the rain; it at length protrudes above the general level of the
                    glacier, and finally forms a cone which appears to be entirely composed of
                    gravel, but is in fact ice at the heart, with merely a protecting cover of
                    earthy matter. These singular cones are very well seen on the glacier of the
                    Aar, but on most others they are comparatively rare. The similar protective
                    action of large stones detached from the moraines and lying on the surface of
                    the ice often produces the striking phenomenon of “glacier tables.” Stones of
                    any considerable size almost invariably stand upon a slightly elevated pillar of
                    ice; but when they are broad and flat they occasionally attain a height of 6 and
                    even of 12 feet above the general level.</p>
                <p>The superficial waste of a glacier is thus a very important phenomenon. Owing to
                    it the body of the ice has its vertical thickness rapidly diminished during the
                    heats of summer, and, as we have already intimated, the lower end of a glacier
                    has its position determined by the amount of this waste. Suppose a glacier to
                    move along its bed at the rate of 300 feet per annum, and imagine (merely for
                    the sake of illustration) its yearly superficial waste to be 20 feet; then the
                    thickness of the glacier will diminish by 20 feet for every 300 feet of its
                    length, or at the rate of 360 feet per mile, so that the longitudinal section of
                    a glacier has the form of a wedge; and however enormous its original thickness,
                    after a certain course we must at length come to the thin end of the wedge, and
                    that the more rapidly as the causes of melting increase towards the lower
                    extremity. These causes are indeed so various that it is difficult to estimate
                    them with accuracy. We have (1) the direct solar heat, (2) the contact of warm
                    air, and (3) the washing of rain. All these causes act on the surface and
                    produce the “ablation” of the surface. Besides these, the ice of the glacier
                    wastes somewhat beneath by the contact of the soil and the washing of the
                    inferior streams. This may be called its “subsidence.” Further, the natural
                    slope of the rocky bed of the glacier causes any point of the surface to stand
                    absolutely lower each day in consequence of the progressive motion. These three
                    causes united produce the “geometrical depression” of the surface. Principal J.
                    D. Forbes showed how the several effects may usually be distinguished by
                    observation. During the height of summer, near the Montanvert, he found the
                    daily average ablation to be 3 ’ 62 inches, the daily subsidence to be 1 ’ 63
                    inches. Seven-tenths of the geometrical depression are due therefore to the
                    former cause, and three-tenths to the latter. This is a very large amount, and
                    it is certain that during the colder period of the year, and whilst the glacier
                    is covered with snow, the subsidence is not only suspended, but the glacier
                    recruits in thickness a portion of its waste during the seasons of summer and
                    autumn. To this subject we shall again return.</p>
                <p>The middle region of the great glaciers of the Alps extends from the level of
                    about 6000 to 8000 feet above the sea. The inclination is usually there most
                    moderate—say from 2⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> to <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >6</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> q</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi> But
                    this is not invariably the case. Beyond 8000 feet we reach the snow-line. The
                    snow-line is a fact as definite on the surface of a glacier as on that of a
                    mountain, only in the former case it occurs at a somewhat lower level. It cannot
                    be too distinctly understood that the fresh snow annually disappears from the
                    glacier proper. Where it ceases entirely to melt, it of course becomes
                    incorporated with the glacier. We have therefore arrived at the region where the
                    glacier <hi rend="italic">forms·,</hi> everywhere below it only <hi
                    rend="italic">wastes.</hi> This snowy region of the glacier is called in French
                    <hi rend="italic">névé,</hi> in German <hi rend="italic">Jim.</hi> As we ascend
                    the glacier it passes gradually from the state of ice to the state of snow. The

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0645-0628"/> superficial layers are more snowy and white, in
                    fact nearly pure snow; the deeper ones have more colour and consistence, and
                    break on the large scale into vast fragments, which at Chamouni are called <hi
                    rend="italic">seracs.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">névé</hi> moves, as the glacier
                    proper does, and it is fissured by the inequalities of the ground over which it
                    passes. These fissures are less regular than those of the lower glacier. They
                    are often much wider, in fact of stupendous dimensions, and, being often covered
                    with treacherous snowy roofs, constitute one of the chief dangers of glacier
                    travelling. The constitution of the <hi rend="italic">névé</hi> may be well
                    studied on the Glacier du Géant, a tributary of the Mer de Glace. The
                    mountain-clefts in which large glaciers lie usually expand in their higher
                    portions (in conformity with the ordinary structure of valleys) into extensive
                    basins in which snow is perpetual, and which therefore contain the <hi
                    rend="italic">névé,</hi> the true origin and material of the glacier, which is
                    literally the overflow of these snowy reservoirs. The amount of overflow, or the
                    discharge of the glacier—upon which depends the extent of its prolongation into
                    the lower valleys—depends in its turn on the extent of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >névé</hi> or collecting reservoir. Glaciers with small reservoirs of necessity
                    perish soon. Their thickness being small, the wedge of the glacier soon thins
                    out. They are common in confined <hi rend="italic">cirques</hi> of the higher
                    mountains. Such are the glaciers of the second order described by De Saussure.
                    Their slope is often very great—from 20° to 40°.</p>
                <p>The ice of the glacier proper has a very peculiar structure, quite distinct from
                    the stratification of the snow on the <hi rend="italic">névé</hi> (the relics of
                    its mode of deposit), and one which requires special notice. When we examine the
                    appearance of the ice in the wall of an ordinary crevasse (especially if it be
                    tolerably near the side of the glacier) we are struck with the beautiful
                    vertically laminated structure (first observed by Principal Forbes) which it
                    commonly presents, resembling delicately veined marble (especially the variety
                    called in Italy <hi rend="italic">cipollino),</hi> in shades varying from
                    bluish-green, through green, to white. When we trace the direction of the planes
                    constituting the laminated structure, by observing them on the surface of the
                    glacier (where they are usually well seen after rain, or in the channels of
                    superficial water-runs), we find that where best developed (or not very far from
                    the sides of the glacier) these laminae are nearly parallel to the sides, but
                    rather incline from the shore to the centre of the ice stream as we follow the
                    declivity of the glacier.</p>
                <p>Forbes found that certain superficial discolorations in the form of excessively
                    elongated hyperbolas are due to the recurrence (at intervals of some hundred
                    feet along the course of the glacier) of portions of ice in which the veined
                    structure is more energetically developed than elsewhere, and where, by the
                    decomposition of the softer laminae, portions of sand and dirt become entangled
                    in the superficial ice, and give rise to the phenomena of “dirt bands,” which
                    thus at a distance display (though in a manner requiring some attention to
                    discover) the exact course of this singular structure on the surface of the
                    glacier. Fig. 1 displays the superficial form of the dirt bands, and the course
                    of the structural laminae projected horizontally. Fig. 2 shows an ideal
                    transverse section of the glacier, and fig. 3 another vertical section parallel
                    to its length. These three sections in rectangular planes will serve to give a
                    correct idea of the course of this remarkable structure within the ice, but a
                    more popular conception will be formed of it from 'he imaginary sections of a
                    canal-shaped glacier in fig. 4. The structure of the compound glacier,
                    originally double, becomes gradually single; and the “frontal dip” of the
                    laminae at the loop of the horizontal curves, which in the upper region is
                    nearly vertical, gradually slopes forwards until at the lower termination it has
                    a very slight dip inwards, or indeed may be reversed and fall outwards and
                    forwards. The general form of a structural lamina of a glacier rudely resembles
                    that of a spoon.</p>
                <p>This structure and the accompanying dirt bands have been recognized by different
                    observers in almost all glaciers, including those of Norway and of India. The
                    interval between the dirt bands has been shown in the case of the Mer de Glace
                    (and therefore probably in other cases) to coincide with annual rate of
                    progression, and in the higher parts of the glacier (towards the <hi
                    rend="italic">névé)</hi> to be accompanied by wrinkles or inequalities of the
                    surface which are well marked by the snow lying in them during the period of its
                    partial disappearance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Motion of Glaciers and its Causes.—</hi> There is something
                    about a glacier which almost inevitably conveys to the mind the idea of a
                    stream. This may be traced in the descriptions of unscientific tourists, of
                    poets, and of some of those who have addressed themselves more seriously to the
                    question of the real nature of these bodies. To the latter class of observers
                    belong Captain Basil Hall and Monseigneur Rendu, bishop of Annecy, who had much
                    more than hinted at the possibility of a true mechanical connexion between the
                    descent of a glacier and that of a mountain torrent, or of a stream of lava. But
                    until the actual conditions of motion were reduced to rule, it was impossible to
                    know how far the analogy was real.</p>
                <p>The most characteristic and remarkable feature of glaciers is their motion
                    downwards from the <hi rend="italic">névé</hi> towards the lower valley. The
                    explanation of it is by far the most important application of mechanical physics
                    connected with the subject. The principal theories to account for the
                    progressive motion of glaciers which were prevalent previous to 1842 may be
                    briefly characterized as De Saussure’s and De Charpentier’s, though each had
                    been maintained long before by the earlier Swiss writers. The first may be
                    called the <hi rend="italic">gravitation</hi> theory, the latter the <hi
                    rend="italic">dilatation</hi> theory. Both suppose that the motion of the ice
                    takes place by its sliding bodily over its rocky bed, but they differ as to the
                    force which urges it over the obstacles opposed by friction and the
                    irregularities of the surface on which it moves.</p>
                <p>The following quotation from De Saussure explains his <pb break="no"

                    masses, carried along by the slope of the bed on which they rest, disengaged by
                    the water (arising from their fusion owing to the natural heat of the earth)
                    from the adhesion which they might otherwise contract to the bottom—sometimes
                    even elevated by the water—must gradually slide and descend along the declivity
                    of the valleys or mountain slopes <hi rend="italic">{croupes)</hi> which they
                    cover. It is this slow but continual sliding of the icy masses <hi rend="italic"
                    >{des glaces)</hi> on their inclined bases which carries them down into the
                    lower valleys, and which replenishes continually the stock of ice in valleys
                    warm enough to produce large trees and rich harvests.” Very sufficient
                    objections have been urged against this theory. It is evident that De Saussure
                    considered a glacier as an accumulation of icy fragments, instead of a great and
                    continuous mass, throughout which the fissures and “crevasses” bear a small
                    proportion to the solid portion; and that he has attributed to the subglacial
                    water a kind and amount of action for which there exists no sufficient or even
                    probable evidence. The main objection, however, is this, that a sliding motion
                    of the kind supposed, if it commence, must be accelerated by gravity, and the
                    glacier must slide from its bed in an avalanche. The small slope of most
                    glaciervalleys, and the extreme irregularity of their bounding walls, are also
                    great objections to this hypothesis.</p>
                <p>The dilatation theory ingeniously meets the difficulty of the want of a
                    sufficient moving power to drag or shove a glacier over its bed, by calling in
                    the well-known force with which water expands on its conversion into ice. The
                    glacier being traversed by innumerable capillary fissures, and being in summer
                    saturated with water in all its parts, it was natural to invoke the freezing
                    action of the night to convert this water into ice, and by the amount of its
                    expansion to urge the glacier onwards in the direction of its greatest slope. In
                    answer to this, it is sufficient to observe, in the first place, that during the
                    height of summer the portions of those glaciers which move fastest are never
                    reduced below the freezing point, and that, even in the most favourable cases of
                    nocturnal radiation producing congelation at the surface, it cannot (by
                    well-known laws of conduction) penetrate above a few inches into the interior of
                    the glacier. Again, the ascertained laws of glacier-motion are (as will be
                    immediately seen) entirely adverse to this theory, as it is always accelerated
                    by hot weather and retarded by cold, yet does not cease even in the depths of
                    winter.</p>
                <p>It is singular how slow observers were to perceive the importance to the solution
                    of the problem of glaciermotion of ascertaining with geometrical precision the
                    amount of motion of the ice, not only from year to year, but from day to day, in
                    summer and winter, whether constant or variable at the same point, whether
                    continuous or by starts; if variable, on what circumstances it depended, and in
                    what manner it was affected at different points of the length and breadth of a
                    glacier.</p>
                <p>This method of studying the question was taken up by Forbes. His observations
                    were commenced on the Mer de Glace of Chamouni, in Juue 1842. Between the 26th
                    and 27th of that month the motion of the ice opposite a point called the “Angle”
                    was found, by means of a theodolite, to be 16 ’ 5 inches in 26 hours; between
                    the 27th and 28th, 17 ’ 4 inches in 25∣ hours; and from about 6 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> to 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> on the 28th the
                    motion was 9 ’ 5 inches, or 17’5 inches in 24 hours; whilst the proportional
                    motion during even an hour and a half was observed. No doubt could therefore
                    remain that the motion of the ice is continuous and tolerably uniform—in short,
                    that it does not move by jerks. He also ascertained about the same time that the
                    motion of the ice is greatest towards the centre of a glacier and slower at the
                    sides, contrary to an opinion then maintained on high authority. He next found
                    that the rate of motion varied at different points of the length of the same
                    glacier, being on the whole greatest where the inclination of its surface is
                    greatest. As the season advanced, he observed notable changes in the rate of
                    motion of the same part of the ice, and connected it by a very striking direct
                    relation with the temperature of the air. These facts were established during
                    the summer of 1842, and promptly published. By means of occasional observations
                    during the following winter and spring by his guide, Auguste Balmat of Chamouni,
                    and by a more full comparison of the entire motion of a glacier for twelve
                    months with its motion during the hot season of the year, another generally
                    received error was rectified: the motion of the glacier continues even in
                    winter, and it has a very perceptible ratio to the summer motion. Last of all,
                    it was found that the surface of a glacier moves faster than the ice nearer the
                    bottom or bed.</p>
                <p>These and some minor laws of motion, being undoubted expressions of the way in
                    which glaciers move, were formulated by Forbes in an approximate theory: “A
                    glacier is an imperfect fluid or a viscous body, which is urged down slopes of a
                    certain inclination by the mutual pressure of its parts.” The analogy subsisting
                    between the motion of a glacier and that of a river (which is a viscous
                    fluid,—were it not so, its motion would be widely different) will be best
                    perceived by stating more precisely its laws of motion.</p>
                <p>1. Each portion of a glacier moves, not indeed with a constant velocity, but in a
                    continuous manner, and not by sudden subsidences with intervals of repose. This,
                    of course, is characteristic also of a river.</p>
                <p>2. The ice in the middle part of the glacier moves much faster than that near the
                    sides or banks; also the surface moves faster than the bottom. Both these facts
                    obtain in the motion of a river in consequence of the friction of the fluid on
                    its banks, and in consequence also of that internal friction of the fluid which
                    constitutes its viscosity.</p>
                <p>Thus, at four stations of the Mer de Glace, distant respectively from the west
                    shore of the glacier 100 230 405 365 yds., the relative velocities were l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 000 1 ’ 332 1 ’ 356 1 ’ 367.</p>
                <p>3. The variation of velocity (as in a river) is most rapid near the sides, whilst
                    the middle parts move nearly uniformly. This and the preceding laws are also
                    fully brought out by the subsequent experiments of Μ. Agassiz on the glacier of
                    the Aar, and of MM. Scnlagintweit on the Pasterzen glacier.</p>
                <p>4. The variation of velocity of a glacier from the sides to the middle is nearly
                    in proportion to the absolute velocity of the glacier,—whether that absolute
                    velocity change in the same place in consequence of change of season, or between
                    one point and another of the length of the same glacier, depending on its
                    declivity. See (5) and (6) below.</p>
                <p>5. The glacier, like a stream, has its pools and its rapids.</p>
                <p>Where it is embayed by rocks it accumulates, its declivity increases, and its
                    velocity at the same time. When it passes down a steep, issuing by a narrow
                    outlet, its velocity increases. Thus the approximate declivities of the
                    inferior, middle, and superior regions of the Mer de Glace (taken in the
                    direction of its length) are 15° 4⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 8°</p>
                <p>and the relative velocities are as the numbers .. 1 ’ 398 ∙574 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 925.</p>
                <p>6. A fact not less important than any of the preceding is that increased
                    temperature of the air favours the motion of the ice, and generally whatever
                    tends to increase the proportion of the watery to the solid constituents of a
                    glacier, as mild rains, and especially the thawing of the superficial snow in
                    spring. The velocity does not, however, descend to zero even in the depth of
                    winter. Indeed, in the lower and most accessible portions of the Mer de Glace
                    (or Glacier des Bois) and the Glacier des Bossons, the ratio of the winter to
                    the summer motion is almost exactly 1:2. On endeavouring to establish a relation
                    between the velocity of the glacier and the temperature of the ambient air, we
                    find that these diminish together almost regularly down to the freezing-point,
                    below which the velocity seems to remain constant.</p>
                <p>Any mechanical theory of glaciers must be more or less imperfect which does not
                    explain the remarkable veined or ribboned structure of the ice, with its
                    peculiar course through the interior of the glacier, as above described.
                    According to Forbes the fundamental idea is that the veined or ribboned
                    structure of the ice is the result of internal forces, by which one portion of
                    ice is dragged past another in a manner so gradual as not necessarily to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n647/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0647-0630"/> produce large fissures in the ice, and the
                    consequent sliding of one detached part over auother, but rather the effect of a
                    general bruise over a considerable space of the yielding body. According to this
                    view, the delicate veins seen in the glacier, often less than a quarter of an
                    inch wide, have their course parallel to the direction of the sliding effort of
                    one portion of the ice over another. Amongst other proofs of this fundamental
                    conception that the veined structure is the external symbol of this forced
                    internal motion of a body comparatively solid, Forbes cited a striking instance
                    from the glacier of La Brenva, on the south side of Mount Blanc. In this case
                    the ice of the glacier, forcibly pressed against the naked rocky face of an
                    opposing hill is turned into a new direction; and in thus shoving and squeezing
                    past a prominence of rock, he observed developed in the ice a “veined structure”
                    so beautiful that “it was impossible to resist the wish to carry off slabs, and
                    to perpetuate it by hand specimens.” This perfectly developed structure was
                    visible opposite the promontory which held the glacier in check, and past which
                    it struggled, leaving a portion of its ice completely embayed in a recess of the
                    shore behind it. Starting from this point as an origin, the veined laminae
                    extended backwards and upwards into the glacier, but did not spread laterally
                    into the embayed ice. They could, however, be traced from the shore to some
                    distance from the promontory into the icy mass. The direction of lamination
                    exactly coincided with that in which the ice must have moved if it was shoved
                    past the promontory at all. That it did so move was made the subject of direct
                    proof, by fixing two marks on the ice opposite the promontory, one on the
                    nearer, the other on the farther side of the belt of ice which had the
                    lamination best developed. The first mark was 50 feet from the shore, and moved
                    at the rate of 4 ’ 9 inches daily; the other mark was 170 feet further off, and
                    moved almost three times faster, or 14 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 inches
                    daily. Throughout this breadth of 170 feet there was not a single longitudinal
                    crevasse which might have facilitated the differential motion. A parallelogram
                    of compact ice, only 170 feet wide, was therefore moving in such a manner that,
                    whilst one of its sides advanced only a foot, the other advanced a yard. No
                    solid body, at least no rigid solid body, can advance in such a manner; Forbes
                    therefore concluded that glacier-ice is plastic, that the veined structure is
                    unquestionably the result of the struggle between the rigidity of the ice and
                    the quasi-fluid character of the motion impressed upon it, and that this
                    follows, not only from the direction of the laminae, but from their becoming
                    disti net exactly in proportion to their nearness to the point where the bruise
                    is necessarily strongest. The subsequent experiments of Sorby on the cleavage
                    structure of rocks proved that it has arisen as the result of intense lateral
                    compression, and could be imitated in many artificial substances. Tyndall
                    obtained it even in beeswax, the analogy between which and the veined structure
                    of ice is very close.</p>
                <p>Though Forbes termed his expression of the laws of glacier motion the“viscous” or
                    “plastic theory,” it was rather a statement of fact than an explanation of the
                    physical processes concerned in the descent of glaciers. Against his views it
                    was of course objected that ice is by its nature a brittle solid, and not
                    sensibly possessed of any viscous or plastic quality. But he cogently replied
                    that the qualities of solid bodies of vast size, and acted on by stupendous and
                    long-continued forces, cannot be estimated from experiments on a small scale,
                    especially if short and violent; that sealing-wax, pitch, and other similar
                    bodies mould themeelves, with time, to the surfaces on which they lie, even at
                    atmospheric temperatures, and whilst they maintain, at the same time, the
                    quality of excessive brittleness under a blow or a rapid change of form; that
                    even ice does not pass at once, and <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >saltum,</hi> from the solid to the liquid state, but absorbs its latent heat
                    throughout a certain small range of temperature (between 28° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 and 32° of Fahrenheit), which is precisely that to
                    which the ice of glaciers is actually exposed; that, after all, a glacier is not
                    a crystalline solid, like ice, tranquilly frozen in a mould, but possesses a
                    peculiar fissured and laminated structure, through which water enters (at least
                    for a great part of the year) into its intrinsic composition. He insisted that
                    the quasi-fluid or viscous motion of the ice of glaciers is not a theory but a
                    fact. A substance which is seen to pour itself out of a large basin through a
                    narrow outlet without losing its continuity; the different parts of which, from
                    top to bottom, and from side to centre, possess distinct though related
                    velocities; which moves over slopes inconsistent with the friction between its
                    surface and the ground on which it rests; which surmounts obstacles, and even if
                    cleft into two streams by a projecting rock, instead of being thereby anchored
                    as a solid would necessarily be, reunites its streams below, and retains no
                    trace of the fissure, leaving the rock an islet in the icy flood;—a substance
                    which moves in such a fashion cannot, Forbes maintained, in any true sense of
                    the word, be termed a rigid solid, but must be granted to be ductile, viscous,
                    plastic, or semifluid, or to possess qualities represented by any of these terms
                    which we may choose to adopt as least shocking to our ordinary conception of the
                    brittleness of ice.</p>
                <p>The problem of the cause of glacier-motion cannot yet be considered to be
                    satisfactorily solved. One of the most important contributions to the solution
                    of this question was made by Professor James Thomson when he predicted that the
                    freezing point of ice must be lowered by pressure, and when he sought by means
                    of this property to explain the plastic or viscous behaviour of glaciers
                    contended for by Forbes. This prediction was experimentally verified by his
                    brother, Sir W. Thomson. Tyndall subsequently to Forbes’s work brought forward
                    an explanation termed the “pressure or fracture and regelation theory.” Some
                    experiments of Faraday in 1850 had shown that two pieces of ice with moistened
                    surfaces would if in contact adhere, owing to the freezing of the thin film of
                    water between them, while at a lower temperature than 32°, aud with consequently
                    dry surfaces, no adhesion took place. The freezing was obtained even under warm
                    water. Starting from those observations Tyndall was led to make experiments on
                    the effects of compression upon iee, and found that a quantity of pounded ice
                    could be moulded into a compact homogeneous mass. This property possessed by ice
                    of reuniting by pressure after fracture was termed regelation, and was applied
                    by Tyndall in explanation of the motion of glaciers. He maintained that the ice
                    of a glacier is a solid brittle substance, and that its descent down a valley is
                    due to constant rupture produced by the effects of gravitation and to the
                    consequent sliding forward of the mass in which the surfaces of fracture
                    speedily reunite. He pointed more particularly to the ice-falls of glaciers
                    where the ice in passing over a steep descent and undergoing great tension does
                    not yield as a viscous body, but is fractured as a solid. More recently Canon
                    Mosely investigated the physics of glaciers, especially by determining the
                    shearing force of the ice. He found that in a glacier of such a uniform section
                    and slope, moving at such a uniform rate, as the Mer de Glace at Les Ponts, the
                    aggregate resistance offered by the ice to its descent is about 31 times greater
                    than the force of gravitation. He therefore concluded it to be physically
                    impossible that a glacier could slide down its valley by its own weight, and
                    consequently that the gravitation or fracture and regelation theory could not be
                    maintained. The slow descent of sheet lead on a roof of moderate inclination,
                    and its ability even to draw out from the rafters the nails with which it had
                    been fastened, led him to propound another theory of glacier-motion, viz., that
                    it is due to expansion <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n648/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0648-0631"/> and contraction caused by changes of solar heat.
                    He contended that the ice, like the lead, is expanded by heat, and that, as it
                    cannot on expansion move up the valley without overcoming the resistance of
                    gravitation as well as of friction, it necessarily moves chiefly downward, in
                    which direction gravitation co-operates. Contraction on the other hand must also
                    tend to send the ice downward, for a larger part will move with the force of
                    gravitation than against it. Dr Croll, objecting to Canon Mosely’s views that no
                    observed alternations of glacier temperature warrant the conclusion that the ice
                    can be impelled downward by that cause, has proposed yet another explanation. He
                    regards the motion of the ice of a glacier as molecular, resulting from the very
                    conduction of heat through the mass of the glacier. He contends that from the
                    thermal conditions of glacier-ice its molecules will melt before their
                    temperature can be raised. Any given molecule on melting will transmit its extra
                    heat or part of it to the next molecule, which in turn may melt, and thus a wave
                    of thaw will travel through the ice. But as each molecule loses its heat again
                    it freezes, and in the act of solidification exerts an enormous pressure on the
                    walls of the interstice into which while fluid it entered. Hence in proportion
                    to the amount of heat received by it the ice is subjected to great molecular
                    pressure. As the glacier cannot expand laterally on account of the walls of its
                    channel, and as gravitation opposes its expansion up the valley, it necessarily
                    finds relief by a downward movement—the direction in which gravitation
                    co-operates.</p>
