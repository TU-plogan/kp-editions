                <p><label type="entry">GIBRALTAR</label>, a British fortress and town in the south
                    of Spain, occupying a grand peninsular headland, which stretches almost due
                    south in a line with the eastern coast of the province of Andalusia, separating
                    the Bay of Algeciras from the open sea of the Mediterranean, and commanding the
                    strait by which the Mediterranean communicates with the Atlantic. Its latitude
                    is 36° 6” 23" N. and its longitude 5° 20' 55" W. The “rock,” as the promontory
                    is familiarly called, is about 2 J miles in length, with a varying breadth of
                    from 2 to 6 furlongs. Rising abruptly from the low sandy isthmus which connects
                    it with the mainland to a height of 1200 feet, the main ridge continues south
                    for about 1∣ miles, being separated by two transverse depressions, known
                    respectively as the Northern and Southern Quebrada, into three pretty distinct
                    summits—the Wolf’s Crag or North Front, the Middle Hill or Signal Station (1255
                    feet high), and the Pan de Azucar or Sugar Loaf Hill, dominated by O’Hara’s
                    tower (1408 feet). This last sum mit descends somewhat abruptly on the south to
                    the Windmill Plateau, an almost level area about half a mile in length by a
                    quarter in breadth, which, from a height of 400 feet above the sea, slopes south
                    till it is only 300 feet above the sea, and then in its turn sinks abruptly for
                    about 200 feet to the Europa Plateau, which, also sloping seaward, terminates in
                    a cliff about 50 feet high. Towards the east or Mediterranean side the
                    promontory presents as precipitous and inaccessible a front as towards the
                    north, but towards the west the ascent is comparatively gradual though
                    interrupted by longitudinal cliffs and ravines, and a considerable space of
                    fairly level ground at the foot affords a site for the town.</p>
                <p>The basement rock of Gibraltar is for the most part a greyish white or pale grey
                    limestone, of compact and sometimes crystalline texture, arranged in beds, but
                    in some places apparently amorphous. Above the limestone is a series of dark
                    greyish blue shales with intercalated beds and bands of grit, sandstone, and
                    limestone; and distributed here and there about the promontory are various
                    limestone breccias, bone-breccias, and calcareous sandstones, as well as loose
                    sand and debris. It is evident that the whole promontory has had an eventful
                    geological history in comparatively recent periods. The limestone and the shales
                    are both of Lower Jurassic age, but the rest of the formations are of much more
                    ancient date. According to the researches of Professors Ramsay and Geikie
                    (“Geology of Gibraltar,” in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of the
                    Geological Society,</hi> London, 1878),the oldest superficial accumulation is
                    the unfossiliferous limestone breccia of Buena Vista, which must have been
                    formed under somewhat severer climatic conditions than the present, and when the
                    rock had a wider area of low ground at its base. This period was probably
                    followed by one with a genial climate, during which the promontory, if indeed it
                    was not rather an isthmus between Europe and Africa, was clothed with vegetation
                    and inhabited by a rich mammalian fauna, whose remains are still found in the
                    Genista caves. Next there came a subsidence of a large proportion of the rock to
                    the extent of 700 feet below the present level, the consequent erosion of ledges
                    and platforms, and the formation of the calcareous sandstones which have
                    incorporated shells of recent Mediterranean species. The process of depression
                    was apparently interrupted by pauses. On its re-elevation, the land was again of
                    greater extent than now; Africa and Europe were perhaps reunited, and the
                    climate was probably genial. By a new depression the rock was brought into its
                    present geographical relations.</p>
                <p>Like most masses of limestone formation, the promontory of Gibraltar is
                    honeycombed with caverns and subterraneous passages, and the Genista cave,
                    already incidentally mentioned, is only one of the many to which it owes the
                    title of the Hill of Caves. A special interest attaches to some of them for the
                    palaeontological and archaeological remains which they yielded to the
                    explorations of Captain Brome between 1863 and 1868. St Michael’s Cave, which is
                    the most frequently visited by strangers, has its entrance about 1100 feet above
                    the sea on the western face of the rock in the line of the Southern Quebrada. A
                    rapid slope of earth gives admission to a hall 200 feet long by 70 feet high,
                    the roof of which appears as if it were supported by massive stalactite pillars;
                    and from this hall access is obtained to a series of four similar caves
                    connected with each other by tortuous passages, the last cave being situated
                    about 300 feet below the surface, and about 400 feet of travelling distance
                    south by west from the entrance. The first of the four was called Victoria cave
                    by its discoverer Captain Brome, and the three others, being more closely
                    associated, received the common name of Leonora’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n601/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0601-0584"/> caves. “Nothing,” says Captain Brome, “can exceed
                    the beauty of the stalactites; they form clusters of every imaginable
                    shape—statuettes, pillars, foliages, figures. Even the American visitors have
                    been compelled to acknowledge that, as regards beauty and picturesqueness, even
                    the Mammoth Cave would not come near them.” The mammalian remains of the Genista
                    cave have been investigated by Mr Busk (“Quaternary Fauna of Gibraltar,” in <hi
                    rend="italic">Trans, of Zool. Soc.,</hi> vol. X. p. 2, 1877), and found to
                    comprise specimens of a bear, probably <hi rend="italic">Ursus fossilis</hi> of
                    Goldfuss; a hyaena, probably <hi rend="italic">H. crocuta</hi> or <hi

                    to that of a wild cat; a rhinoceros similar to the species found in the valley
                    of the Thames; two forms of ibex; and the hare and the rabbit. No trace has been
                    discovered of <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros tichorinus,</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">speloeus,</hi> or of the reindeer, and the only
                    relic of the elephant as yet registered within the peninsula is a perfect

                <p>To the voyager entering the straits the rock presents a bare and almost barren
                    aspect, especially when the summer suns have dried up the verdure; but as he
                    approaches he discovers a considerable clothing of vegetation, and closer
                    acquaintance reveals the existence of an extensive flora. Here and there a
                    grassy glen gives shelter to a group of trees, and the villas of the English
                    residents are surrounded with luxuriant gardens and copses. Dr E. F. Kelaart in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Flora Calpensis</hi> (London, 1846) enumerates upwards of
                    400 flowering plants and ferns as indigenous to Gibraltar, and about fifty as
                    introduced. Of the former a few appear to be species peculiar to the rock. White
                    poplars, the cotton-tree, the pepper-tree or pimenta, the ilex, and the pine are
                    the most noticeable of the larger trees; the bella-sombra <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phytolacca dioica),</hi> introduced by General Don, the aloe, and the prickly
                    pear are common; and on the eastern side of the rock the dwarf palm <hi
                    rend="italic">(Chamoerops</hi><hi rend="italic">humins')</hi> covers large
                    areas. Among the fruit trees, which, however, are cultivated rather for ornament
                    than for profit, may be mentioned the almond, the olive, the orange, the lemon,
                    the pomegranate, the fig, and the loquat. In January and February many portions
                    of the rock present a charming sight from the profusion and beauty of the wild
                    flowers. The fauna of Gibraltar is naturally poor,—rabbits, foxes, partridges,
                    pigeons, and woodcocks being the principal species. The little Barbary apes, of
                    which every schoolboy has heard, but which not every resident in Gibraltar has
                    seen, are few in number, not more than twenty perhaps, and they usually inhabit
                    the higher and eastern parts of the rock, except when they are driven towards
                    the lower grôunds by the cold winds from the north-east. They then do a little
                    damage to the fruit trees; but they enjoy impunity as perfect as that of the
                    storks in Holland or the ibis in Egypt. As to its climate Gibraltar belongs to
                    the subtropical zone, with a dry summer and a rainy season in winter. More than
                    half the rainfall of the year, which only amounts to about 28 or 30 inches,
                    occurs in November, December, and January; and the three months of June, July,
                    and August are hardly refreshed by a shower. The temperature is subject to
                    frequent disturbances: from 93° to 87° is the highest reached (July), and 43°
                    the lowest (February), and the mean for the summer months is from 74° to 79°. In
                    summer the heat is tempered by a sea-breeze which blows from about 10 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> till shortly before sunset. Easterly winds or
                    levanters are common from July to November, and during their prevalence every
                    living creature seems to suffer. Heavy dews and thick fogs occur in autumn, and
                    are as disagreeable as they are unhealthy. In the early part of the present
                    century Gibraltar was notoriously filthy and ill-drained, and epidemic diseases
                    committed great ravages from time to time; but great improvements have been
                    effected, especially through the sanitary com· mission instituted in 1865. The
                    inhabitants were formerly dependent on the rainfall for most of their water
                    supply, the springs in the rock being both scanty and brackish; but in 1869 an
                    abundant source of fairly good water was found to exist under the sands of the
                    North Front, and pump3 and conduits have been constructed for its distribution.
                    In 1876 the quality of the water was reported to be deteriorating. Besides the
                    private tanks, still numerous throughout the town, there are eight bomb-proof
                    cisterns for rain-water, of a total capacity of 40,000 tons. The navy tank, for
                    the supply of ships, holds from 9000 to 11,000 tons.</p>
                <p>Gibraltar is emphatically a fortress, and in some respects its fortifications are
                    unique. On the eastern side the rock needs no defence beyond its own precipitous
                    cliffs, and in all other directions it has been rendered practically
                    impregnable. Besides a sea-wall extending at intervals round the western base of
                    the rock, and strengthened by curtains and bastions and three formidable forts,
                    there are batteries in all available positions from the sea-wall up to the
                    summit 1350 feet above the sea; and a remarkable series of galleries has been
                    hewn out of the solid face of the rock towards the north and north-west. These
                    galleries have an aggregate length of between 2 and 3 miles, and their breadth
                    is sufficient to let a carriage pass. Port-holes are cut at intervals of 12
                    yards, so contrived that the gunners are safe from the shot of any possible
                    assailants. At the end of one of the galleries hollowed out in a prominent part
                    of the cliff is St George’s Hall, 50 feet long by 35 feet wide, in which the
                    governor was accustomed to give fêtes. Alterations, extensions, and improvements
                    are continually taking place in the defensive system, and new guns of the most
                    formidable sort are gradually displacing or supplementing the old-fashioned
                    ordnance. The whole population of Gibraltar, whether civil or military, is
                    subjected to certain stringent rules. For even a day’s sojourn the alien must
                    obtain a pass from the town-major, and if he wish to remain longer a consul or
                    householder must become security for his good behaviour. Licences of residence
                    are granted only for short periods—ten, fifteen, or twenty days—but they can be
                    renewed if occasion require. Military officers may introduce a stranger for
                    thirty days. A special permit is necessary if the visitor wishes to sketch.</p>
                <p>Though the town of Gibraltar may be said to date from the 14th century, it has
                    preserved very little architectural evidence of its antiquity. Rebuilt on an
                    enlarged and improved plan after its almost complete destruction during the
                    great siege, it is still on the whole a mean-looking town, with narrow streets
                    and lanes and an incongruous mixture of houses after the English and the Spanish
                    types. As a proprietor may at any moment be called upon to give up his bouse and
                    ground at the demand of the military authorities, he is naturally deterred from
                    spending his money on substantial or sumptuous erections. The area of the town
                    is about 100 acres. The public buildings comprise the cathedral of the Holy
                    Trinity, a poor imitation of Moorish architecture; the governor’s house,
                    formerly a Franciscan monastery and still familiarly known as “The Convent the
                    exchange; the court-house; the civil hospital; the revenue offices; and the
                    garrison library,planned by Colonel Drinkwater in 1793. The library has
                    excellent readingrooms, and contains from 40,000 to 45,000 volumes. At the
                    north-east corner of the town stand the remains of the Moorish castle. Towards
                    the south the lower grounds are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n602/mode/1up"

                    Gardens, laid out by General Don in 1814; and beyond these are the old convict
                    establishment, the dockyard, and the new-mole parade. Further south, at Rosia,
                    is the naval hospital, erected in 1771.</p>
                <p>Gibraltar has been a free port since the year 1705,—a distinction which it owes
                    in part to the refusal of the emperor of Morocco to allow the export of
                    materials for the fortifications unless his subjects obtained full liberty of
                    trade. In the early part of the present century the commercial activity of the
                    little colony was remarkably great. While the average value per annum of British
                    manufactures exported to the rest of Spain during the ten years from 1831 to
                    1840 was less than ,£385,000, the corresponding average for Gibraltar was more
                    than £486,000; and in the year 1840 the ratio of Spain and Gibraltar was
                    £404,252 to £1,111,176. Since that date there has been comparatively little
                    advance,—the average annual value of all the British and colonial produce and
                    manufactures for the ten years from 1868 to 1877 being £1,074,785. Besides the
                    legitimate trade fostered by the demands of the garrison and the neighbouring
                    cities of Spain, Gibraltar has long had a large contraband traffic especially in
                    tobacco and Manchester goods. Mainly carried on by Spaniards, it continued to
                    thrive in spite of the exertions of the Spanish authorities, and is now kept
                    down mainly by the action of British officials. About 1200 tons of tobacco are
                    sold annually in the Jews’ Market; no fewer than eleven houses import upwards of
                    1000 tons annually; and its manufacture and manipulation give employment, it is
                    said, to about 1550 persons. Fully two-thirds of the tobacco comes from Calcutta
                    and other Indian ports. “Wool, grain, and wax from Morocco, fruit, wine, oil,
                    and other produce from Spain, are sent to Gibraltar for transhipment to England,
                    France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Portugal, America, ports in the
                    Mediterranean, India, and China.” As a port of call, the Bay of Gibraltar has
                    recently increased in importance. Upwards of 5000 vessels enter the port
                    annually, and of these more than half are propelled by steam. The average annual
                    tonnage of the ships that entered between 1871 and 1875 was 2,069,508; and of
                    this no less than 1,594,174 was British. Quarantine was established in 1830. By
                    the shipping act of 1868 the governor was empowered to remove from the register
                    any vessel guilty of a violation of the Spanish revenue laws discreditable to
                    the British flag. In 1865 a duty was imposed on wines and spirits. Great
                    commotion was caused among the mercantile population of Gibraltar in 1871 by a
                    proposed customs ordinance, framed for the suppression of the smuggling. One of
                    its chief provisions was that no tobacco should be exported or imported in
                    vessels of less than 100 tons burden or in packets of less than 80 lb.</p>
                <p>The population of Gibraltar in 1840 was 15,554, of whom 11,313 were British
                    subjects and 4241 aliens; and by 1850 it had increased to 15,823, with 3641
                    aliens. In 1860 the civil population, including foreigners visiting the
                    garrison, amounted to 17,647; but the number of resident inhabitants was only
                    15,467. According to returns for 1872 the total population was 18,695 (8969
                    males and 9726 females), the aliens numbering 2241 and the military 6521. The
                    death-rate of the civil population varies from 25 to 31 per thousand, but it is
                    almost always exceeded by the birth-rate. During the five years 1871-1875 the
                    average number of births per annum was 592 ’ 4, and of deaths 538 ’ 2. Besides
                    the natives, who themselves are of various origin, there are always in the town
                    considerable numbers of Spaniards, Portuguese, and Italians, as well as stray
                    representatives of almost every nationality engaged in the trade of the
                    Mediterranean. Though by the treaty of Utrecht it was specially bargained by
                    Spain that “no leave shall be given under any pretence whatever either to Jews
                    or Moors to reside or have their dwelling in the town of Gibraltar,” the native
                    Jews by 1844 numbered no fewer than 1385.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the population is Roman Catholic, but full religious liberty
                    is of course enjoyed. The church of the Holy Trinity was constituted to be a
                    cathedral and bishop’s see of the Church of England in 1843. The Wesleyans and
                    the Presbyterians have places of worship. St Andrew’s, the new Presbyterian
                    church, was built by the Free Church of Scotland in 1854. A proposal for
                    concomitant endowment of “church bodies for the Anglican and Roman Catholic
                    communities” with the annual sum of £500 was made by the governor in 1876, but
                    it was not sanctioned by parliament. An annual grant to this amount is made to
                    both bodies, but the Government no longer keeps the cathedral in repair. The
                    Roman Catholic bishop of Antinoe is vicar apostolic of Gibraltar.</p>
                <p>Gibraltar was long an ill-managed and expensive colony; but its expenditure is
                    now sometimes even less than its revenue. During the five years from 1871 to
                    1875 the average expenditure, increased by several unusual items, was £43,988;
                    and the average income was £42,464. For 1877 the expenditure was £41,585, or
                    £1739 more than the income. The chief sources of the revenue are the port and
                    quarantine dues, the excise on the consumption of wines and spirits, and the
                    ground and house rents,—the three departments yielding respectively on the
                    average from 1871 to 1875 £11,011, £11,512, and £6,206. It is worthy of note
                    that the ground and house rentals have increased from £5629 in 1871 to £7078 in
                    1875. Among the heavier items of outlay are the governor’s salary, which amounts
                    to £5000 per annum, and the judicial and ecclesi astical expenses, which were,
                    on an average from 1871 to 1875, respectively £3909 and £1061. The total cost of
                    the military establishment was, on the average of four years from 1869 to 1873,
                    £315,454,—of which £250,340 was the average cost of the regular troops, £1610
                    for the jails, and £19,293 for the barracks. The convict establishment was
                    abolished in 1875. At that date it contained 238 prisoners, who were managed on
                    the associated system; and grievous complaints were made of the difficulty of
                    maintaining satisfactory discipline.</p>
                <p>History.—Gibraltar was known to the Greek and Roman geographers as Calpe or
                    AIybe, the two names being probably corruptions of the same local (perhaps
                    Phoenician) word. The eminence on the African coast near Ceuta which bears the
                    modern English name oi Apes’ Hill was then designated Abyla; and Calpe and
                    Abyla, at least according to an ancient and widely current interpretation,
                    formed the renowned Pillars of Hercules (Herculis columnae, 'Hpaκλdoυs στ⅞λαι)
                    which for centuries were the limits of enterprise to the seafaring peoples of
                    the Mediterranean world. The strategic importance of the rock appears to have
                    been first discovered by the Moors, who, when they crossed over from Africa in
                    the 8th century, selected it as the site of a fortress. From their leader Tarik
                    ibn Zeyad it was called Gebel Tarik or Tank's Hill; and, though the name had a
                    competitor in Gebel at Futah or Hill of the Entrance, it gradually-gained
                    acceptance, and still remains sufficientlyrecognizableinthe cor-nιpted form of
                    the present day. The first siege of the rock was in 1309, when it was taken by
                    Alonzo Perez de Guzman for Ferdinand IV. of Spain, who, in order to attract
                    inhabitants to the spot, offered an asylum to swindlers, thieves, and murderers,
                    and promised to levy no· taxes on the import or export of goods. The attack of
                    Ismail ben Ferez in 1315 (2d siege) was frustrated; but in 1333 Vasco Paez de
                    Meira, having allowed the fortifications and garrison to decay, was obliged to
                    capitulate to Mahomet IV. (3d siege). Alphonso’s attempts to recover possession
                    (4th siege) were futile, though pertinacious and heroic, and he was obliged to
                    content himself with a tribute for the rock from Abdul Melek of Granada; but
                    after his successful attack on Algeciras in 1344 he was encouraged to try his
                    fortune again at Gibraltar. In 1349 he invested the rock, but the siege (5th
                    siege) was brought to an untimely close by his death from the plague in February
                    1350. The next or 6th siege resulted simply in the transference of the coveted
                    position from the hands of the king of Morocco to those of Yussef 111. of
                    Granada; and the 7th, undertaken by the Spanish count of Niebla, Enrico de
                    Guzman, proved fatal to the besieger and his forces. In 1462, however, success
                    attended the efforts of Alonzo <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n603/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0603-0586"/> de Arcos (8th siege), and in August the rock
                    passed once more under Christian sway. The duke of Medina Sidonia, a powerful
                    grandee who had assisted in its capture, was anxious to get possession of the
                    fortress, and though Henry IV. at first managed to maintain the claims of the
                    crown, the duke ultimately made good his ambition by force of arms (9th siege),
                    and in 1469 the king was constrained to declare his son and his heirs perpetual
                    governors of Gibraltar. In 1479 Ferdinand and Isabella made the second duke
                    marquisof Gibraltar, and in 1492 the third duke Don Juan was reluctantly allowed
                    to retain the fortress. At length, in 1501 Garcilaso de la Vega was ordered to
                    take possession of the place in the king’s name and it was formally incorporated
                    with the domains of the crown. After Ferdinand and Isabella were both dead the
                    duke Don Juan tried in 1506 to recover possession, and added a 10th to the list
                    of sieges. Thirty-four years afterwards the garrison had to defend itself
                    against a much more formidable attack (llth siege)—the pirates of Algiers having
                    determined to recover the rock for Mahomet and themselves. The conflict was
                    severe, but resulted in the repulse of the besiegers. After this the Spaniards
                    made great efforts to strengthen the place, and they succeeded so well that
                    throughout Europe Gibraltar was regarded as impregnable.</p>
                <p>In the course of the War of the Spanish Succession, however, it was taken by a
                    combined English and Dutch fleet under Sir George Rooke, assisted by a body of
                    troops under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt. The captors had ostensibly fought
                    in the interests of Charles archduke of Austria (afterwards Charles III.), but,
                    though his sovereignty over the rock was proclaimed on July 24, 1704, Sir George
                    Rooke on his own responsibility caused the English flag to be hoisted, and took
                    possession in name of Queen Anne. It is hardly to the honour of England that it
                    was both unprincipled enough to sanction and ratify the occupation, and
                    ungrateful enough to leave unrewarded the general to whose unscrupulous
                    patriotism the acquisition was due. The Spaniards keenly felt the injustice done
                    to them, and the inhabitants of the town of Gibraltar in great numbers abandoned
                    their homes rather than recognize the authority of the invaders. In October 1704
                    the rock was invested by sea and land; but the Spanish ships were dispersed by
                    Sir John Leake, and the marquis of Villadarias fared so ill with his forces that
                    he was replaced by Marshal Tessé, who was at length compelled to raise the siege
                    in April 1705. During the next twenty years there were endless negotiations for
                    the peaceful surrender of the fortress, and in .1726 the Spaniards again
                    appealed to arms. But the Conde de la Tones, who had the chief command,
                    succeeded no better than his predecessors, and the defence of the garrison under
                    General Clayton and the earl of Portmore was so effective that the armistice of
                    June 23d practically put a close to the siege, though two years elapsed before
                    the general pacification ensued. The most memorable siege of Gibraltar, indeed
                    one of the most memorable of all sieges, was that which it sustained from the
                    combined land and sea forces of France and Spain during the years 1779-1783. The
                    grand attack on the place was made on the 13th September 1782, and all the
                    resources of power and science were exhausted by the assailants in the fruitless
                    attempt. On the side of the sea they brought to bear against the fortress
                    forty-six sail of the line, and a countless fleet of gun and mortar boats. But
                    their chief hope lay in the floating batteries planned by D’Arçon, an eminent
                    French engineer, and built at the cost of half a million sterling. They were so
                    constructed as to be impenetrable by the red-hot shot which it was foreseen the
                    garrison ιvould employ; and such hopes were entertained of their efficiency that
                    they were styled invincible. The Count d’Artois (afterwards Charles X.) hastened
                    from Paris to witness the capture of the place. He arrived in time to see the
                    total destruction of the floating batteries, and a considerable portion of the
                    combined fleet, by the English fire. Despite this disaster, however, the siege
                    continued till brought to a close by the general pacification, February 2d,
                    1783. The history of the four eventful years’ siege is fully detailed in the
                    work of Drinkwater, who himself took part in the defence, and in the Life of its
                    gallant defender Sir George Augustus Eliott, afterwards Lord Heathfield, whose
                    military skill and moral courage place him among the best soldiers and noblest
                    men whom Europe produced during the 18th century.</p>
                <p>Since 1783 the history of Gibraltar has been comparatively uneventful. In the
                    beginning of 1801 there were rumours of a Spanish and French attack, but the
                    Spanish ships were defeated off Algeciras iιi June by Admiral Saumarez.
                    Improvements in the fortifications, maintenance of military discipline, and
                    legislation in regard to trade and smuggling are the principal matters of recent
                    interest.</p>
