                    believed to have the habit implied by the common name it bears in many European

                    >gidoe,</hi> a group remarkable for the flat head, enormously wide mouth, large
                    eyes, and soft, pencilled plumage of its members, which vary in size from a Lark
                    to a Crow. Its position has been variously assigned by systematists. Though of
                    late years judiciously removed from the <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> in
                    which Linnaeus placed all the species known to him, Professor Huxley considers
                    it to form, with two other Families—the Swifts <hi rend="italic"

                    distinct Family, <hi rend="italic">Podargidce.</hi> As a matter of convenience
                    we shall here comprehend these last in the <hi rend="italic">Caprimulgidoe,</hi>
                    which will then contain two subfamilies, <hi rend="italic">Caprimulginoe</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Podar-giηce</hi>; for what, according to older authors,
                    constitutes a third, though represented only by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sleatomis,</hi> the singular</p>
                <p>Oil-bird, or Guacharo, certainly seems to require separation as an independent
                    Family (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Guacharo).</hi></p>
                <p>Some of the differences between the <hi rend="italic">Caprimulginoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Podargince</hi> have been pointed out by Mr Sclater <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zοol. Soc.,</hi> 1866, p. 123), and are very obvious. In
                    the former, the outer toes have <hi rend="italic">four</hi> phalanges only, thus
                    presenting a very uncommon character among birds, and the middle claws are
                    pectinated; while in the latter the normal number of five phalanges is found,
                    and the claws are smooth, and other distinctions more recondite have also been
                    indicated by him <hi rend="italic">(tom. cit.,</hi> p. 582). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Caprinvulginae</hi> may be further divided into those having the
                    gape thickly beset by strong bristles, and those in which there are few such
                    bristles or none—the former containing the genera <hi rend="italic">Capri
                    mulgus, Antrostomus, Nyctidromus,</hi> and others, and the tatter <hi
                    rend="italic">Podager,</hi><hi rend="italic">Chordiles, Lyncornis,</hi> and a
                    few more.</p>
                <p>The common Goatsucker of Europe <hi rend="italic">(C</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cziropoeus)</hi> arrives late in spring from its winter retreat in Africa, and
                    its presence is soon made known to us by its habit of chasing its prey,
                    consisting chiefly of moths and cockchafers, in the evening-twilight. As the
                    season advances the song of the cock, from its singularity, attracts attention
                    amid all rural sounds. This song seems to be always uttered when the bird is at
                    rest, though the contrary has been asserted, and is the continuous repetition of
                    a single burring note, as of a thin lath fixed at one end and in a state of
                    vibration at the other, and loud enough to reach in still weather a distance of
                    halfa-mile or more. On the wing, while toying with its mate, or performing its
                    rapid evolutions round the trees where it finds its food, it has the habit of
                    occasionally producing another and equally extraordinary sound, sudden and
                    short, but somewhat resembling that made by swinging a thong in the air, though
                    whether this noise proceeds from its mouth is not ascertained. In general its
                    flight is silent, but at times when disturbed from its repose, its w ings may be
                    heard to smite together. The Goatsucker, or, to use perhaps its commoner English
                    name, Nightjar,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Other
                    English names of the bird are Evejar, Fern-Owl, Chum-Owl, and Wheel-bird—the
                    last from the bird’s song resembling the noise made by a spinning-wheel in
                    motion.</p></note> passes the day in slumber, crouching on the ground or
                    perching on a tree —in the latter case sitting not across the branch but
                    lengthways, with its head lower than its body. In hot weather, however, its song
                    may sometimes be heard by day and even at noontide, but it is then uttered, as
                    it were, drowsily, and without the vigour that characterizes its crepuscular or
                    nocturnal performance. Towards evening the bird becomes active, and it seems to
                    pursue its prey throughout the night uninterruptedly, or only occasionally
                    pausing for a few seconds to alight on a bare spot—a pathway or road— and then
                    resuming its career. It is one of the few birds that absolutely make no nest,
                    but lays its pair of beautifully-marbled eggs on the ground, generally where the
                    herbage is short, and often actually on the soil. So light is it that the act of
                    brooding, even where there is some vegetable growth, produces no visible
                    depression of the grass, moss, or lichens on which the eggs rest, and the finest
                    sand equally fails to exhibit a trace of the parental act. Yet scarcely any bird
                    shows greater local attachment, and the precise site chosen one year is almost
                    certain to be occupied the next. The young, covered when hatched with
                    dark-spotted down, are not easily found, nor are they more easily discovered on
                    becoming fledged, for their plumage almost entirely resembles that of the
                    adults, being a mixture of reddish-brown, grey, and black, blended and mottled
                    in a manner that passes description. They soon attain their full size and power
                    of flight, and then take to the same manner of life as their parents. In autumn
                    all leave their summer haunts for the south, but the exact time of their
                    departure has hardly been ascertained. The habits of the Nightjar, as thus
                    described, seem to be more or less essentially those of the whole Subfamily—the
                    differences observable being apparently less than are found in other groups ot
                    birds of similar extent.</p>
                <p>A second species of Goatsucker (C ’. <hi rend="italic">mιficollis'),</hi> which
                    is somewhat larger, and has the neck distinctly marked with rufous, is a summer
                    visitant to the south-western parts of Europe, and especially to Spain and
                    Portugal. The occur, rence of a single example of this bird at Killingworth,
                    near Newcastle-on-Tyne, in October 185G, has been recorded by Mr Hancock <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1862, p. 39); but the season of its appearance argues
                    the probability of its being but a casual straggler from its proper home. Many
                    other species of <hi rend="italic">Caprimulgus</hi> inhabit Africa, Asia, and
                    their islands, while one <hi rend="italic">(C. macrurus)</hi> is found in
                    Australia. Very nearly allied to this genus is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antrostοnus,</hi> an American group containing many species, of which the
                    Chuck-wilΓs-widow <hi rend="italic">(A. carol inensis')</hi> and the
                    Whip-poor-will <hi rend="italic">(A. voci-ferus)</hi> of the eastern United
                    States (the latter also reaching Canada) are familiar examples. Both these birds
                    take their common name from the cry they utter, and their habits seem to be
                    almost identical with those of the Old-World Goatsuckers. Passing over some
                    other forms which need not here be mentioned, the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nyctidrοmus,</hi> though consisting of only one species <hi rend="italic">(E.
                    albicollis')</hi> which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0735-0712"/> inhabits Central and part of South America,
                    requires remark, since it has tarsi of sufficient length to enable it to run
                    swiftly on the ground, while the legs of most birds of the Family are so short
                    that they can make but a shuffling progress. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heleothrep&gt;tfs,</hi> with the unique form of wing possessed by the male,
                    needs mention. Notice must also be taken of two African species, referred by
                    some ornithologists to as many genera <hi rend="italic">(Macrodl·pteryx</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Cos-metornis),</hi> though probably one genus would suffice
                    for both. The males of each of them are characterized by the wonderful
                    development of the ninth primary in either wing, which reaches in fully adult
                    specimens the extraordinary length of 17 inches or more. The former of these
                    birds, the <hi rend="italic">C. macrodipterus</hi> of Afzelius, is considered to
                    belong to the west coast of Africa, and the shaft of the elongated remiges is
                    bare for the greater part of its length, retaining the web, in a spatulate form,
                    only near the tip. The latter, to which the specific name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vexillarius</hi> was given by Mr Gould, has been found on the east coast of
                    that continent, and is reported to have occurred in Madagascar and Socotra. In
                    this the remigial streamers do not lose their barbs, and as a few of the next
                    quills are also to some extent elongated, the bird, when flying, is said to look
                    as though it had four wings. Specimens of both are rare in collections, and no
                    traveller seems to have had the opportunity of studying the habits of either so
                    as to suggest a reason for this marvellous sexual development.</p>
                <p>The second group of <hi rend="italic">Caprimulginoe,</hi> those which are but
                    poorly or not at all furnished with rictal bristles, contains about five genera,
                    of which there is here only room to particularize <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lyncornis</hi> of the Old World and <hi rend="italic">Chοrdiles</hi> of the
                    New. The species of the former are remarkable for the tuft of feathers which
                    springs from each side of the head, above and behind the ears, so as to give the
                    bird an appearance like some of the “Horned” Owls—those of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Scops,</hi> for example; and remarkable as it is to find certain
                    forms of two Families, so distinct as are the <hi rend="italic">Strigidoe</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Caprimulgidoe,</hi> resembling each other in this
                    singular external feature, it is yet more remarkable to note that in some groups
                    of the latter, as in some of the former, a very curious kind of dimorphism takes
                    place. In either case this has been frequently asserted to be sexual, but on
                    that point doubt may fairly be entertained. Certain it is that in some groups of
                    Goatsuckers, as in some groups of Owls, inclivi duals of the same species are
                    found in plumage of two entirely different hues—rufous and grey. The only
                    explanation as yet offered of this fact is that the difference is sexual, but,
                    as just hinted, evidence to that effect is conflicting. It must not, however, be
                    supposed that this com mon feature, any more than that of the existence of
                    tufted forms in each group, indicates any close relationship between them. The
                    resemblances may be due to the same causes, concerning which future observers
                    may possibly enlighten us, but at present we must regard them as analogies not
                    homologies. The species of <hi rend="italic">Lyncornis</hi> inhabit the Malay
                    Archipelago, one, however, occurring also in China Of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chordiles</hi> the best known species is the Night-hawk of North America (C*.
                    <hi rend="italic">virginianus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C. popetud),</hi> which
                    has a wide range from Canada to Brazil. Others are found in the Antilles and in
                    South America. The general habits of all these birds agree with those of the
                    typical Goatsuckers.</p>
                <p>We have next to consider the birds forming the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Podargus</hi> and those allied to it, whether they be regarded as a distinct
                    Family, or as a Subfamily of <hi rend="italic">Caprimulgidoe.</hi> As above
                    stated, they have feet constructed as those of birds normally are, and their
                    sternum seems to present the constant though comparatively trivial difference of
                    having its posterior margin elongated into two pairs of processes, while only
                    one pair is found in the true Goatsuckers. <hi rend="italic">Podargus</hi>
                    includes the bird <hi rend="italic">[P. cuνieri)</hi> known from its cry as
                    Morepork to Tasmanian colonists,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In New Zealand, however, this name is given to an Owl <hi
                    rend="italic">{Scela. glaux nova·zelandiai).</hi></p></note> and several other
                    species, the number of which is doubtful, from Australia and New Guinea. They
                    have comparatively powerful bills, and it would seem feed to some extent on
                    fruits and berries, though they mainly subsist on insects, chiefly <hi
                    rend="italic">Cicadoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phasmidoe.</hi> They also
                    differ from the true Goatsuckers in having the outer toes partially reversible,
                    and they are said to build a flat nest on the horizontal branch of a tree for
                    the reception of their eggs, which are of a spotless white. Apparently allied to
                    <hi rend="italic">Podargus,</hi> but differing among other respects in its mode
                    of nidification, is <hi rend="italic">Aegotheles,</hi> which belongs also to the
                    Australian Subregion; and further to the northward, extending throughout the
                    Malay Archipelago and into India, comes <hi rend="italic">Batrachostomus,</hi>
                    wherein we again meet with species having aural tufts somewhat like <hi
                    rend="italic">Lyηcomis.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Podar-gin&lt;x</hi> are
                    thought by some to be represented in the New World by the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Nyctibius,</hi> of which several species occur from the Antilles
                    and Central America to Brazil. Finally, it maybe stated that none of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Caprimulgidoe</hi> seem to occur in Polynesia or in New Zealand,
                    though there is scarcely any other part of the world suited to their habits in
                    which members of the Family are not found, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
