                    born at Cheyne Row, Chelsea, September 29, 1810. She was the second child of
                    William Stevenson, of whom an account is given in the <hi rend="italic">Annual
                    Biography and Obituary</hi> for 1830. Mr Stevenson, who began life as classical
                    tutor in the Manchester Academy, and preached also at Doblane, near that town,
                    afterwards relinquished his ministry and became a farmer in East Lothian; and
                    later, on the failure of his farming enterprises, he kept a boarding-house for
                    students in Drummond Street, Edinburgh, where he also became editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scots Magazine,</hi> and contributed largely to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> At the time of his daughter’s birth Mr
                    Stevenson had been appointed Keeper <pb break="no"

                    Chelsea, still a diligent contributor to various periodicals of the day. Mrs
                    Stevenson, Mrs Gaskell’s mother, was a Miss Holland, of Sandlebridge in
                    Cheshire, an aunt of the late Sir Henry Holland. She died at the birth of her
                    daughter, who was in a manner adopted, when she was only a month old, by her
                    mother’s sister, Mrs Lumb. This lady had married a wealthy Yorkshire gentleman,
                    but a few months after her marriage, and before the birth of her child,
                    discovered that her husband was insane, and fled from him to her old home in the
                    little market town of Knutsford, in Cheshire. Mrs Lumb’s own daughter having
                    died, she transferred all her affection to the little Elizabeth, between whom
                    and her there existed through life the strongest bond of affection. During
                    Elizabeth’s childhood at Knutsford she was visited now and then by her
                    sailor-brother; but while she was still a girl he went to India, where he
                    somewhat mysteriously, and without any apparent motive, disappeared, and all
                    further trace of him was lost. She was afterwards sent for about two years to a
                    school kept by a Miss Byerley at Stratford-on-Avon, and on leaving school went
                    for a time to live with her father, who had married again. Under his guidance
                    she continued her studies, reading with him in history and literature, and
                    working, chiefly by herself, at Latin, Italian, and French, in all of which she
                    was in later life proficient. Having tenderly nursed her father in his last
                    illness, she returned to her aunt at his death in 1829; and, with the exception
                    of one or two visits to Newcastle, London, and Edinburgh, she continued to live
                    at Knutsford till her marriage. She had at this time a reputation for great
                    beauty; and even in later life her exquisitely-shaped soft eyes retained their
                    light, and her smile its wonderful sweetness. Her marriage to the Rev. William
                    Gaskell, M.A., of Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, took place August 30, 1832,
                    at Knutsford church; and during the earlier years of her married life Mrs
                    Gaskell lived very quietly in Manchester, surrounded by a few intimate and
                    cultured friends, and devoting all her time and abilities to the cares of a
                    necessarily frugal household. Among these friendships, that with Miss Catherine
                    Winkworth and her sistere was perhaps the longest and most cherished. From the
                    first, although she never visited the poor as a member of any organized society,
                    she sought by all means in her power to relieve the misery which, in a town like
                    Manchester, she was constantly witnessing. She gave the most devoted help and
                    tender sympathy to such cases of individual distress as came under her notice.
                    She assisted Mr Travers Madge in his missionary work amongst the poor, and was
                    the friend and helper of Thomas Wright, the -prison philanthropist. She also
                    made several individual .friendships among poor people, and knew personally one
                    or two types of the Chartist working-man. She was specially interested in the
                    young working-women of Manchester, and for some years held a weekly evening
                    class at her own house for talking with them and teaching them. Of Mrs Gaskell’s
                    seven children, two were still-born, and another, her only son, born between the
                    third and fourth of her four living daughters, died at the age of ten months.
                    The death of this baby is said to have been the cause of Mrs Gaskell’s beginning
                    to write, when she was urged by her husband to do so, in order to turn her
                    thoughts from her own grief. She began by writing a short paper called “An
                    Account of Clopton Hall,” for William Howitt’s <hi rend="italic">Visits
                    to</hi><hi rend="italic">Remarkahle</hi><hi rend="italic">Places.</hi> This was
                    followed by one or two short stories, such as the “Sexton’s Hero,” for the <hi
                    rend="italic">People's Journal</hi>; and then she wrote <hi rend="italic">Mary
                    Barton, a Tale of Manchester Life.</hi> On its completion, she sent it to one
                    publisher in London who rejected it unread, and then to Messrs Chapman and Hall,
                    who, after keeping the manuscript for a year without acknowledgment, wrote to
                    her accepting the novel for publication, and offering the authoress .£100 for
                    the copyright. The appearance of <hi rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi> in 1848
                    caused great excitement in Manchester, and a strong partisanship was felt for
                    and against its anonymous author. After its publication Mrs Gaskell paid several
                    visits in London, where she made many friends, among whom we may mention
                    Dickens, Forster, Mrs Jameson, Lord Houghton, Mrs Stowe, Ruskin, and Florence
                    Nightingale. Her friendship with Charlotte Bronte also dates from about this
                    time, when the two authoresses met at the house of Sir James and Lady Kay
                    Shuttleworth, near Bowness, in Westmoreland, and Mrs Gaskell received her first
                    impressions of the shy “little lady in a black silk gown,” who afterwards became
                    personally her dear friend,—although, from a literary point of view, they could
                    hardly help being rivals,—and the story of whose life, when it was ended, Mrs
                    Gaskell was destined to write with such consummate care and tender appreciation.
                    But <hi rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi> was to prove only the first of a series
                    of scarcely less popular publications, which appeared either independently or in
                    periodicals such as <hi rend="italic">Household Words.</hi> It was followed in
                    1850 by <hi rend="italic">The Moorland Cottage. Cranford</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ruth</hi> appeared in 1853; <hi rend="italic">North and
                    South,</hi> in 1855; <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charlotte Bronte,</hi> in
                    1857; <hi rend="italic">Round the Sofa,</hi> in 1859; <hi rend="italic">Right at
                    Last,</hi> in 1860; <hi rend="italic">Sylvia's Lovers,</hi> in 1863; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cousin Phillis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wives and
                    Daughters,</hi> in 1865.</p>
                <p>During these years—years of increasing worldly prosperity and literary
                    distinction—Mrs Gaskell often went abroad, chiefly to Paris and Rome, but once
                    for a long visit to Heidelberg, and once also to Brussels, to collect
                    information about Charlotte Bronte’s school-days. In Paris her genius was warmly
                    appreciated; and, while she was a guest among them, Guizot, Montalembert, and
                    Odillon Barrot vied in doing her honour. Of her visits in England some of the
                    pleasantest were to Oxford, where she counted among her friends Mr Jowett and Mr
                    Stanley (dean of Westminster). At other times, when she was busy writing one of
                    her novels, she would leave home with one or two of her children, and carry her
                    manuscript to some quiet country place, where she could write undisturbed. When
                    she was at home, although she was enthusiastically interested in the political
                    questions of the day, and her warm, impulsive nature made her ready at any time
                    to give personal help and sympathy where it seemed to be needed, Mrs Gaskell
                    refrained from taking active part in public movements or social reforms, if we
                    except, indeed, the great sewing-school movement in Manchester at the time of
                    the cotton famine in 1862. Her life was thoroughly literary and domestic. She
                    read much: Goldsmith, Pope, Cowper, and Scott were the favourite authors of her
                    girlhood; in later life she admired Ruskin and Macaulay extremely, and delighted
                    in many old French memoirs of the time of Madame de Sévigné, whose life she
                    often planned to write. It is remembered of her that one day, when she was
                    reading George Eliot’s first and anonymous story <hi rend="italic">Amos
                    Barton,</hi> she looked up and said, “I prophesy that the writer of this will be
                    a great writer some day.” The prospect of the awful cotton famine in Manchester
                    in 1862 set Mrs Gaskell anxiously thinking what could be done to relieve the
                    coming distress, and she decided, “without any suggestions from others, on a
                    plan of giving relief and employment together to the women mill-hands, which was
                    an exact prototype of the great system of relief afterwards publicly adopted,
                    namely, the sewing-schools.” When these were formed, Mrs Gaskell “merged her
                    private scheme in the public one, and worked most laboriously in the
                    sewing-school nearest her home.” This was but three years before her death.
                    Still busy writing her novel <hi rend="italic">Wives and Daughters,</hi> she was
                    staying with her children at Holybourne, Alton, in Hampshire, a house which she
                    had just purchased as a surprise and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0114-0105"/> gift to her husband, when she died suddenly of
                    heart disease, about <hi rend="italic">5</hi> o’clock on Sunday evening,
                    November 12, 1865. Her remains were carried to the churchyard of the Old
                    Presbyterian Meeting-house at Knutsford, where her childhood and girlhood had
                    been spent, and which she had left as a bride, three-and-thirty years before. A
                    memorial tablet in memory of Mrs Gaskell was erected by her husband’s
                    congregation, in Cross Street Chapel, Manchester—a tribute not only to her
                    genius, and the spirit in which it was exercised, but to the “tenderness and
                    fidelity” of the wife and mother who had lived long amongst them.</p>
                <p>With this knowledge of the facts of Mrs Gaskell’s life, it is not difficult to
                    trace the sources of her inspirations. Some of her shorter tales, it is true,
                    seem to have been suggested merely by her readings; and, carefully as she
                    collected their materials, these are the least satisfactory of her writings. But
                    by far the most of what she wrote was foundfed on observation and experience.
                    Mrs Gaskell has reproduced, with slight variations, in her novel <hi
                    rend="italic">North and South,</hi> the <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> incident in
                    her father’s youth, when he and his friend and fellow-student, the Rev. George
                    Wicke of Monton, believing it wrong to be “hired teachers of religion,” resigned
                    their ministries and sought a livelihood otherwise. The beautiful story in “Mary
                    Barton” of the two working-men who brought the baby from London to Manchester is
                    a version of an anecdote about Mrs Gaskell’s own infancy, of her being taken to
                    Knutsford, after her mother’s death, by a friend who chanced to be travelling
                    that way. The little county town of “Cranford”—with its population of widows and
                    maiden ladies, and its horror of the masculine portion of society—is Knutsford,
                    so long Mrs Gaskell’s home. In <hi rend="italic">Cranford</hi> every character,
                    if not every incident, is real; and the pathetic little story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Poor Peter</hi> can have been suggested only by the disappearance
                    of that sailor brother who used to visit Mrs Gaskell in her girlhood, and whose
                    mysterious loss also must have interested her always afterwards in
                    “disappearances ”—the title of one of her papers in <hi rend="italic">Household
                    Words.</hi> Pleasant months spent at Morecambe Bay and Silver-dale initiated her
                    in the mysteries of rural and farm life. Her visits to France were the origin of
                    her tales of the Huguenots and the French refugees at the time of the
                    Revolution. The Edinburgh of her girlhood appears in one or two of her stories,
                    briefly but vividly sketched. Her schooldays at Stratford-on-Avon are remembered
                    in <hi rend="italic">Lois the Witch</hi>; and, if only in a little story like
                    the visit to Heppenheim, we can trace her excursions from Heidelberg along the
                    broad, white Bergstrasse. But it is most of all in <hi rend="italic">Mary
                    Barton,</hi> a story of the trials and sorrows of the poor in Manchester, whom
                    she had had so many opportunities of observing, that Mrs Gaskell gave her
                    personal knowledge and experience to the world. Her severest critic, Mr W. R.
                    Greg, admits Mrs Gaskell’s knowledge of her subject, but objects to the
                    impression left by the novel on the mind of the reader as inaccurate and
                    harmful. “Were <hi rend="italic">Mary Barton,”</hi> he says, “to be only read by
                    Manchester men and master manufacturers, it could scarcely fail to be
                    serviceable, because they might profit by its suggestions, and would at once
                    detect its exaggerations and mistakes but on the general public he fears its
                    effect will be “mischievous in the extreme.” One doubts whether a calm solution
                    of a great economic difficulty, such as that which Mrs Gaskell treats of, could
                    ever be given in a novel; and certainly the warm-hearted, impulsive authoress of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi> had no such aim in view. It is probable that
                    she wrote without any distinct economic theories. Earnest, benevolent intentions
                    she no doubt had, but she was far more of an artist than a reformer. Had it not
                    been so, <hi rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi> would not rank so high in the
                    literature of fiction as it does. It is no work of occasion, the chief interest
                    of which departs when the occasion itself is over. It is a thoroughly artistic
                    production, and for power of treatment and intense interest of plot has seldom
                    been surpassed. It is as the authoress of <hi rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi>
                    that Mrs Gaskell will be remembered. Of her other works, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ruth</hi> is singularly inferior to its predecessor; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >North and South,</hi> which takes the side of the master manufacturers, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi> did that of the men, has been scarcely less
                    popular with the public. Perhaps the two best of Mrs Gaskell’s productions, each
                    in its own way, are the exquisitely humorous <hi rend="italic">Cranford</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Cousin Phillis,</hi> which has been fitly called an idyll in
                    prose. <hi rend="italic">Wives and Daughters,</hi> even in its uncompleted
                    state, is artistically almost faultless, and full of a quiet restful beauty
                    entirely its own. George Sand was a great admirer of this novel, and Mrs
                    Gaskell’s family still cherish a saying of hers about it :—“It is a book,” she
                    once said to Lord Houghton, “that might be put into the hands of an innocent
                    girl, while at the same time it would rivet the attention of the most <hi
                    rend="italic">blase</hi> man of the world.” Her one work which is not a
                    novel—her <hi rend="italic">Life of Charlotte Bronte—</hi> it is difficult to
                    praise too highly, either as a biography proper, or as a narrative written with
                    the consummate skill of the novelist. Some people, indeed, have thought that Mrs
                    Gaskell transgressed the bounds of the biographer in publishing so many details
                    of Miss Bronte’s domestic and private life; but the case was a peculiar one. The
                    character of Charlotte Bronte’s writings made it advisable that her reader, in
                    order properly to understand her, should be admitted to some of the hitherto
                    hidden facts of her short, sad life. Mrs Gaskell, knowing and esteeming
                    Charlotte Bronte in the character of friend, daughter, and wife, hoped in some
                    degree to justify to the world the morbid, unhealthy tone which pervaded her
                    genius; and surely, if any hand was to draw the curtain, none could have done it
                    more tenderly than that of her friend. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. μ.)</hi></p>
