                    (1728-1787), one of the most celebrated, if not one of the soundest, political
                    economists of Italy, was born at Chieti on the 2d of December 1728. For his
                    early education and opportunities of advancement in life he was less indebted to
                    his parents than to his uncle, Monsignor Celestino Galiani. By his care, and at
                    his expense, Galiani received the best education which Naples and Rome could
                    then furnish, becoming qualified for an ecclesiastical career at a time when a
                    clever abbé might hope to fill with profit and reputation important offices in
                    the state as well as in the church. Galiani gave early promise of distinction as
                    an economist, and even more as a wit. At the age of twenty-two he had produced
                    two works by which his name became widely known far beyond the bounds of his own
                    Naples. His taste for economic studies had been developed in the society of such
                    men as Genovesi and Intieri, and prompted the composition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Trattato della</hi><hi rend="italic">Moneta,</hi> in which many
                    aspects of the question of exchange are set forth, always with a special
                    reference to the state of confusion then presented by the whole monetary system
                    of the Neapolitan Government. Galiani’s fame as a humorist dated from the
                    appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Raccolta in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Morte</hi><hi rend="italic">del Βoia,</hi> a work as popular in Italian
                    literary circles during the last century as the <hi rend="italic">Rejected
                    Addresses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bon Gaultier Ballads</hi> have been in our
                    own. In this volume Galiani parodied with exquisite felicity, in a series of
                    discourses on the death of the public hangman, the style of the most pompous and
                    pedantic Neapolitan writers of the day. Galiani’s political knowledge and social
                    qualities now pointed him out to the discriminating eye of Charles III., and his
                    liberal minister Tanucci, as one eminently fitted to serve the Government as a
                    diplomatist in France. He was therefore attached in the character of secretary
                    to the Neapolitan embassy at Paris. Thither he repaired in 1759, at a time when
                    a change in the relations between the courts of Paris and Vienna was about to
                    exercise an influence on the course of the Seven Years’ War, when the different
                    Bourbon courts were engaged in a common action against the J esuits, and when
                    economic science held a foremost place in the speculations of the most eminent
                    French writers. Galiani is chiefly remembered by posterity by the part which he
                    took in these economic discussions. His <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur les blés,</hi> though published after his return to Naples,
                    produced on its appearance a great <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0034-0025"/> impression, and has again and again furnished to
                    future controversialists arguments more specious than solid against the liberty
                    of exporting corn. The criticism of Voltaire, that Galiani’s volume united the
                    wisdom of Plato and the wit of Molière, will not be accepted as a decisive
                    judgment on the merits of the treatise; but it may be viewed as a tolerably fair
                    test of the regard in which it was held by Galiani’s contemporaries. Galiani
                    returned to Naples after a ten years’ residence in Paris, where his reputation
                    as a wit had long surpassed that of an economist or a statesman. Until his death
                    at Naples, on October 30,1787, he kept up with his old Parisian friends a
                    correspondence, of which the tone on his side can only be compared to the
                    wailing and howling sent forth by Ovid during his banishment to the shores of
                    the Euxine. Absence from Paris was with him the synonym of social and literary
                    death.</p>
