                <p><label type="entry">GNOSTICISM</label>, a general name applied to various forms
                    of speculation in the early history of the church. The term γvωσις is found in
                    the Septuagint translation of the Old <pb break="no"

                    denoting the knowledge of the true God, or knowledge communicated by Him. In the
                    New Testament the word is frequently used by St Paul (1 Cor. i. <hi
                    rend="italic">5,</hi> xii. 8; 2 Cor. iv. 6, X. 5), and in the second epistle of
                    St Peter (i. 5, 6; iii. 18), to express the saving knowledge of God in Christ;
                    and in the first epistle to Timothy occurs the significant phrase, “Oppositions
                    of Science (γνώσεων) falsely so called.” It may be inferred, therefore, that the
                    use of the simple term, in a bad as well as a good sense, was not unknown to the
                    apostolic age, although the expression γνωστικός (Gnostic) is said not to be
                    found till the beginning of the 2d century, when it was first employed by the
                    sect of the Ophites, or, according to some, by Carpocrates. Both expressions
                    were used by the early Christian fathers with the double meaning already
                    indicated. Clement of Alexandria, in his <hi rend="italic">Stromata</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> entitles the enlightened or perfect Christian a
                    Gnostic <hi rend="italic">(Strom.</hi> i. 20, ii. 6). He points out at length
                    the distinction between the true Gnostic and the disciples of false systems who
                    laid claim to the name of Gnostics. It is only to systems of the latter kind
                    that the name of Gnosticism is now applied.</p>
                <p>The sources of Gnosticism are to be found in diverse forms of religious and
                    speculative culture antecedent to Christianity, especially in the theology of
                    the Alexandrian Jews, as represented in the writings of Philo, and again in the
                    influences flowing from the old Persian or Zarathustrian religion and the
                    Buddhistic faiths of the East. To the theosophic system of Philo, with its
                    mixture of Platonic and Old Testament ideas, some of the most characteristic
                    conceptions of Gnosticism are certainly to be traced, such as the infinite
                    separation between God and the world, and the necessity of a mediating power or
                    powers in the creation of the world. This class of ideas prevailed largely at
                    the time of the introduction of Christianity, especially in Alexandria, which
                    was the great meeting-point of Jewish and Hellenic culture. The more the state
                    of the pre-Christian Jewish mind and Jewish literature is investigated, the more
                    do we recognize everywhere a strange commingling of old with new thoughts, of
                    tradition with philosophy, of religion with speculation. The age was in all its
                    aspects eclectic, and the Jewish no less than the Gentile schools of the time
                    were centres for the fusion of old streams of culture from many quarters, and
                    the rise of broader intellectual tendencies. Ever since t <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi> ιe captivity, Judaism had borne more or less the impress of the old
                    state religion which it encountered in its exile. How far post-Exilian Judaism
                    was moulded by Zarathustrian conceptions is a very difficult question; but no
                    historical student can doubt that its cosmogony, its angelology, and even its
                    anthropology, were largely modified by contact with Persia. But not only was
                    Zarathustrianism active in and through Judaism. In itself, it spread westward,
                    and became directly and indirectly both a precursor and a parent of Gnostic
                    speculation. Certain forms of Gnosticism seem little else than adaptations of
                    the Persian dualism to the solution of the great problem of good and evil. In
                    other forms of it, again, the Pantheism of India seems to have been a pervading
                    influence. This, too, has its representative in the Jewish schools of the time,
                    in the secret doctrines of the Kabbala, which many carry considerably beyond the
                    time of Christ, although the two books through which we alone know these
                    doctrines— the <hi rend="italic">Book of Creation</hi> and the book called <hi
                    rend="italic">Zohar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Light</hi> —are plainly of much
                    later production. These doctrines sprang up in Palestine, and not among the
                    Hellenistic Jews. The philosophy on which they rest is plainly pantheistic.
                    Whereas the principle lying at the foundation of the theosophy of Philo makes
                    almost an absolute distinction between the Supreme indefinable Source of all
                    things and the world, the philosophic postulate of the Kabbala is the identity
                    of God and the world—the one being the Eternal Substance of which the other is
                    the manifestation and form. “In place of the personal God, distinct from the
                    world, acknowledged in the Old Testament, the Kabbala substitutes the idea of an
                    universal and infinite substance, always active, always thinking, and in the
                    process of thought, developing the universe. In the place of a material world
                    distinct from God and created from nothing, the Kabbalist substitutes the idea
                    of two worlds—the one intelligible, the other sensible,—both being, not
                    substances distinct from God, but forms under which the Divine Sub stance
                    manifests itself” (Mansei’s <hi rend="italic">Gnostic Heresies,</hi> p. 35).</p>
                <p>Gnosticism is found reproducing one and all of these conceptions, with the
                    additional idea of <hi rend="italic">redemption</hi> directly borrowed from
                    Christianity. In all its forms, it may be said to represent the efforts made by
                    the speculative spirit of the time to appropriate Christianity, and to make use
                    of some of its most fertile principles for the solution of the mysteries lying
                    at the root of human speculation. The more advanced writers of the present day
                    refuse to recognize Gnosticism as a <hi rend="italic">heresy,</hi> or to speak
                    of the Gnostics as deserters from the Christian Church. And they are right so
                    far. The Gnostic schools were always so far outside the church. They were not
                    <hi rend="italic">heretical,</hi> therefore, in the ordinary sense. But it is no
                    less true that Gnosticism, in all its developments, is only intelligible in
                    connexion with Christianity. It was the impulse of Christian ideas which alone
                    originated it, which constituted the vital force of thought that made it one of
                    the most significant phenomena of early Christian history; and it is only its
                    connexion with Christianity which can be said to make it any longer
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>The question as to the date of its origin has been much investigated of late by
                    such writers as the late Dean Mansel among ourselves, and Lipsius, Harnack, and
                    Hilgenfeld in Germany. Do we find traces of it in the New Testament writings'?
                    or are the supposed allusions to it there to be otherwise explained? It is well
                    known that this question has an important bearing upon other questions as to the
                    origin of some of the New Testament writings, and the special object for which
                    these writings were composed. Without entering into details, or attempting to
                    examine the several passages which may be supposed to contain allusions to
                    Gnosticism in the New Testament, it may be said that such allusions, more or
                    less definite, seem to occur in the later epistles of St Paul, especially the
                    epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, and in the Pastoral epistles. A
                    supposed allusion has also been traced in the first epistle to the Corinthians,
                    where the word γvωσις, for the first time in the New Testament writings, is
                    found in a depreciatory sense, in the phrase <hi rend="italic">η</hi> γvωσtς <hi
                    rend="italic">φvσιοι,</hi><hi rend="italic">η</hi> δε <hi rend="italic"
                    >αγάπη</hi><hi rend="italic">οlκοδοpeι</hi> (1 Cor. viii. 1). In so very general
                    a use of the expression, however, even in its connexion with the question of
                    eating meats which had been offered to idols, it must be held very doubtful
                    whether anything more than a general meaning is intended. And the same remark
                    applies to many even of the more defined modes of expression, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Pleroma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeon,</hi> which occur in the
                    later epistles. The true explanation of all these phrases, as well as much else
                    in St Paul’s writings, is probably the fact that the spirit of Gnosticism, and
                    the language which it afterwards developed and applied, were “in the air” of the
                    apostolic age. Its modes of thought, as already seen, were prevalent in Philo
                    and in other quarters, and the tendencies which were afterwards worked up into
                    systems were no doubt in existence in the time of St Paul, and still more in the
                    later apostolic time. It seems plainly against such tendencies, rather than
                    against any special sects or schools, that the cautions of St Paul are directed.
                    In the Apocalypse, and in the epistles and gospel attributed to St John, these
                    tendencies are seen in a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0725-0702"/> more developed although hardly in a more distinct
                    state. The second chapter (vv. 6-15) of the Apocalypse has been held to mention
                    a sect of the Gnostics by name—the Nicolaitans—a sect supposed to derive its
                    name from Nicolas, one of the seven deacons, who had departed from the faith and
                    fallen into licentious doctrines and practices. Even in such a sect as this,
                    however, we recognize rather the expression of those lax and restless tendencies
                    which sought everywhere to corrupt the doctrines of the gospel, than any clear
                    philosophical bias. Upon the whole, it may be concluded that what we see in the
                    writings of the New Testament is exactly what w e might expect. The Gnostical
                    spirit is present, but Gnosticism is as yet undeveloped. The apostolic age is an
                    age of transition, in which the speculative and ethical spirit of the time is
                    everywhere seen encountering the new life of Christianity, and new seeds of
                    creative thought are everywhere springing from the encounter. There are teachers
                    of all kinds, especially Jewish teachers, busy throughout the Roman world. But
                    Gnosticism properly so-called, as a series of speculative systems, is not yet
                    born. Its approach is heralded by many tendencies forecasting it; but it is only
                    in the Syrian and Alexandrian schools of the beginning of the 2d century that we
                    see it coming forth into distinct shape. Men like Simon Magus and his pupil
                    Menander, the former the opponent of St Peter, and again men like Cerinthus, the
                    opponent of St John, may be called Gnostics. In such traditions of their
                    teaching as survive, we see the workings of the Gnostical spirit—the spirit
                    which sought to transmute the facts of Christianity into some ideological
                    theory. But none of these leaders elaborated systems, or at least we are no
                    longer able to trace with precision of outline the doctrines which they taught.
                    Properly speaking, therefore, they are the precursors of Gnosticism, rather than
                    the founders of Gnostic schools. It is implied by Irenaeus (i. 25) that the
                    followers of Carpocrates first called themselves Gnostics; and again by
                    Hippolytus that this designation was first assumed by the Ophites (1. v.). But
                    little can be gathered from writers like Irenaeus, or even Hippolytus, as to the
                    true order of development of the Gnostic systems. With the former, for example,
                    Saturninus and Basilides stand not only before Carpocrates, but before
                    Cerinthus, the Ebionites, and the Nicolaitans (i. 24, 26). The last thing to
                    seek in the early fathers is either accuracy of chronology, or a clear sequence
                    of thought. They handle topics, for the most part, quite irrespective of either;
                    and the student is forced back mainly, if not exclusively, on internal evidence
                    as his only trustworthy guide in analysing and classifying the systems of
                    thought which prevailed in the first two centuries.</p>
                <p>According to such evidence, and the bias of individual writers, the Gnostic
                    systems have been very differently classified. Mosheim has divided them with
                    reference to their greater or less recognition of the Dualistic principle;
                    Neander with reference to their relation to Judaism; F. Baur with reference to
                    their relation both to Judaism and heathenism. Lipsius, one of the most recent
                    and careful writers on the subject, arranges the Gnostical systems in a
                    threefold order—1st, in so far as they arise within the Jewish schools, and aim
                    to distinguish between Christianity and Judaism; 2d, in so far as they appear
                    within the broader sphere of Hellenism; and 3d, in so far as they approach the
                    circle of Christian faith, and become more or less united with the doctrines of
                    the church.</p>
                <p>The most intelligible principle of classification seems to be that already
                    indicated, which recognizes first an inchoate period corresponding to the New
                    Testament age, and represented by many diverse teachers, chiefly of Jewish
                    origin, and then fixes attention upon the great schools of Syria and of Egypt,
                    with the addition of that of Asia Minor, represented by Marcion. These schools
                    are distinguished by their internal features, and their respective relations to
                    Judaism on the one hand and dualism on the other; but they stand out more
                    clearly from their geographical centres, perhaps, than from any other
                    distinguishing features.</p>
                <p>I. The inchoate phase of Gnosticism is represented by men like Simon and
                    Cerinthus, both prominently associated with apostles and sects, such as the
                    Ophites or Naasseni (from tJ ’ ∏2, serpent), the Peratae or Peratics,the
                    Sethiani, and the followers of one Justinus, author of a book called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Baruch</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"
                    > i</hi> which was written probably not earlier than the beginning of the 2d
                    century. All these sects are elaborately described by Hippolytus in the fifth
                    book of his <hi rend="italic">Refutation of Heresies.</hi> Simon Magus follows
                    them in his order of treatment (1. v.). There can be little doubt, however, that
                    Simon must be placed in the very front of the history of Gnosticism, in so far
                    as he belongs to this history at all. This is the position that he occupies in
                    the treatise of Irenaeus <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Haereses,</hi> 1. i. c. 23);
                    and his association with St Peter, as well as the account of him in the
                    apostolic history in which he appears (Acts viii. 5, 9, 10) within seven years
                    of the ascension of our Lord, plainly indicates that this is his true position.
                    The character of his teaching, moreover, points to the same conclusion. It is a
                    form of anti-Christianism, rather than any mere depravation of the Christian
                    system. It is true that lie is represented in the passage of the Acts of the
                    Apostles already referred to (viii. 13) as having professed himself a believer,
                    and having been baptized; but his whole career afterwards, and the doctrines
                    attributed to him, prove that, whatever may have been his feelings for the
                    moment, he neither understood Christianity, nor came under its practical
                    influence in any degree. Probably he regarded the apostles as only magicians of
                    remarkable skill, and enrolled himself for a time in their company in order that
                    he might learn their secrets and be able to exercise their powers. He was
                    plainly an impostor of the first magnitude, who must be credited with a
                    marvellous and unblushing audacity rather than with any clear philosophic or
                    spiritual aims. He gave himself out as “the great power of God” (Acts viii. 10).
                    “Ego sum sermo Dei,” he said of himself, according to St Jerome (on Matt, xxiv.
                    5), with much blasphemous nonsense besides. He carried about with him a “certain
                    woman named Helena,” a prostitute whom he had purchased in the city of Tyre, and
                    who he said “was the first conception (Έννοια) of his mind, the mother of all
                    things, by whom in the beginning he conceived the thought of making the angels
                    and archangels” (Iren., <hi rend="italic">Adv. Haer.,</hi> i. 23). He recognized
                    Christ as Redeemer, but only as occupying an inferior position to himself. He
                    was the true Logos or Power of God, which had previously in an imperfect degree
                    appeared in Jesus. He himself is “the God who is over all things, and the world
                    was made by his angels” (Zδz√., i. 23). It is clear that a teacher of this kind
                    had little relation to Christianity, except in so far as it came across his own
                    designing and ambitious path. He had knowledge and intellectual address to avail
                    himself of the prevailing conceptions of the Alexandrian philosophy, so as to
                    impart some coherency to his own insane dreams; but he was characteristically a
                    magician (as his character has survived in history) rather than a philosopher or
                    spiritual thinker. He claims the position assigned to him in the history of
                    Gnosticism mainly in virtue of his pupil and successor Menander who laid the
                    foundation at Antioch of the Syrian Gnostic school more conspicuously
                    represented by Saturninus and others.</p>

                    statement of actual facts; but there seems no doubt that Cerinthus represented,
                    in the close of the 1st century, a type of doctrine especially opposed to that
                    of the fourth gospel. He is supposed to have been of Jewish descent, to have
                    been educated in Alexandria, and to have diffused his doctrine in Asia Minor.
                    Opposed as he was to the Christianity of the church in attributing the creation
                    of the world, not to the Supreme God, but to “a power separate and distinct
                    from” Him, and in conceiving Jesus as a mere man to whom the Christ was united
                    at baptism, and from whom the Christ departed before His death (Iren., i. 2;
                    Hippolytus, vii. 33), he was yet far from being the mere anti-Christian impostor
                    that Simon was. He makes no claim to miraculous or divine powers in himself, but
                    holds a distinct, however erroneous, Christology. The idea of redemption is not
                    only recognized by him, but recognized as verified in Christ and in Him alone.
                    His chief conception of the Creator of the world being other than the Supreme
                    God was probably borrowed by him from the Egyptian schools in which he seems to
                    have taught.</p>
                <p>The sects of the Naasseni, the Peratae, the Sethiani, and the followers of
                    Justin, placed, as we have said, by Hippolytus before Simon, may probably all be
                    ranked along with him and Cerinthus in the early and still undeveloped stage of
                    Gnosticism. It is very difficult to attain to any certainty as to their
                    chronological position. Bunsen traces the origin of the Ophites as far back as
                    the Pauline age; but on very definite grounds it may be concluded that the sect,
                    if existent then, could hardly have acquired any prominence or intellectual
                    interest,—not even in the time of St John: and certain details of their teaching
                    cannot well be earlier than the beginning of the 2d century. Hippolytus gives a
                    distinct and lengthened account of these several sects. The Naasseni, he says,
                    borrowed their opinions from the Greek philosophers and the teachers of the
                    mysteries; the Peratae took them “not from the Scriptures, but from the
                    Astrologers;” the Sethiani “patched up their system out of shreds of opinion
                    taken from Musaeus, and Linus, and Orpheus and Justin was indebted for his to
                    the “marvels of Herodotus !” He says, moreover, of the Naasseni that they “call
                    themselves Gnostics.” We must leave here, as elsewhere, the more particular
                    description of these sects to special articles. All of them, however, may, with
                    Mansel <hi rend="italic">(Gnostic Heresies,</hi> p. 96), be regarded as branches
                    of a common sect to which the title of Ophites particularly answers. The serpent
                    was more or less a common symbol with them all; and the idea of the serpent as
                    in some manner a redeeming power for mankind—“a symbol of intellect by whose
                    means our first parents were raised to the knowledge of the existence of higher
                    beings than their creator ”—seems to have run through them all. The serpent no
                    doubt tempted man, but he fell from allegiance to the Demiurge, or Creator of
                    the present world, only to rise to the knowledge of a higher world. Thus to
                    identify the serpent with the Redeeming Word or Divine Son came very near to
                    converting the power of Evil into the ideal of Good. This was the logical
                    conclusion which probably lay more or less in all their systems; but it only
                    showed itself fully in a cognate sect called the Cainites, the description of
                    which follows that of the Ophites and the Sethians in the first book of the
                    treatise of Irenaeus (c. xxxi.). This sect carried to its extreme form the
                    inversion of Biblical story, and raised the serpent into a creative and
                    redeeming power. All the evil characters in the Old Testament, with Cain at
                    their head, are set forth as the true spiritual heroes; and, in consistency with
                    the same view, Judas Iscariot, in the New Testament, is represented as alone
                    “knowing the truth,”and so accomplishing the betrayal of the Saviour, as some
                    later theorists have also supposed, in order that His good work might be
                    completed. They had a gospel of their own in the interest of such views, which
                    they styled “the gospel of Judas.”</p>
                <p>Another name in the history of Gnosticism, that of Carpocrates, may be classed in
                    this earlier period, although he is said to have been still active as a teacher
                    in the time of Hadrian (117-138). The followers of Carpocrates, as already
                    mentioned, are represented by Irenaeus (i. 25) as first styling themselves
                    Gnostics. His opinions had a certain affinity both with those of Cerinthus and
                    the Ophites. They are described at length by Irenaeus (i. 25) and Hippolytus
                    (vii. 20). Both writers also ascribe to this teacher and his disciples a great
                    devotion to magical arts, and accuse them of voluptuousness and even
                    licentiousness of life. They seem to have cherished an esoteric doctrine which
                    inculcated the indifference of all actions, and that nothing was really evil by
                    nature. Some of the teachers of the sect marked their pupils by branding them on
                    the inside of the lobe of the right ear. Epiphanes, a son of Carpocrates, is
                    associated with his father in the reign of Hadrian as actively promoting the
                    spread of their heresy, and, dying young, he is said to have been worshipped as
                    a god by the inhabitants of a town in Cephalonia, of which his mother was a
                    native. He must have been a remarkable youth, credited as he is with a work on
                    <hi rend="italic">Justice,</hi> fragments of which have been preserved by
                    Clement of Alexandria, advocating a very outrageous form of communism. Women of
                    note allied themselves to this free confederacy, one of whom, Marcellina, came
                    to Rome in the time of Anicetus (d. 168), and “led multitudes astray” (Iren. i.
                    25; see also <hi rend="smallcaps">Carpocrates).</hi></p>
                <p>II. But, as already indicated, it is not till the first quarter of the 2d century
                    that we see Gnosticism in full and systematic development; and then it ranges
                    from two main centres—Antioch in Syria, and Alexandria.</p>
                <p>(1.) Menander, the pupil of Simon, settled at Antioch, and there laid the
                    foundation of the Syrian Gnostic school, whose chief representatives in the 2d
                    century are Saturninus, Tatian, and Bardesanes, the last two of whom were more
                    or less connected with the church—Tatian, as a pupil of Justin Martyr, and the
                    writer of a harmony of the four gospels under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diatessaron,</hi> and Bardesanes as one of the first of the interesting series
                    of hymn-writers for which we are indebted to the Syrian church. The Syrian
                    Gnosis is distinguished by its admixture of Zarathustrian elements, and the
                    consequent sharpness and precision with which it seizes the idea of conflict
                    between the powers of Good and Evil—the Supreme God, on the one hand, and the
                    Demiurge and his angels or aeons, on the other hand. For a more particular
                    account of the characteristics of the system, see articles on the names above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>(2.) Along with the Syrian school, and occupying a more prominent place in the
                    development of the religious thought of the 2d century, stands the great school
                    of Alexandrian Gnosticism, represented especially by Basilides and Valentinus
                    and their followers. Basilides appears to have been a native of Syria, and to
                    have taught in Alexandria about the year 125. “He is the first Gnostic teacher,”
                    says Bunsen <hi rend="italic">(Hippolytus</hi><hi rend="italic">and his
                    Age,</hi> p. 107), “who has left an individual personal stamp upon his age. . .
                    . His erudition is unquestionable. He had studied Plato deeply. . . . All that
                    was great in the Basilidean system was the originality of thought and moral
                    earnestness of its founder.” Bunsen also maintains that “Basilides was a pious
                    Christian, and worshipped with his congregation,” while admitting that his sect
                    fell away from the church and from Christianity by refusing to recognize the
                    authority of Scripture and the necessity of practical Christian communion.</p>
                <p>Valentinus was probably educated in the school of Alexandrian Gnosticism, as he
                    developed Gnostic ideas in their connexion with Hellenic, rather than Persian,
                    modes of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0727-0704"/> thought into the most elaborate and carefully
                    reasoned system which they reached. He came to Rome about the year 140, and
                    there formed a sect which exercised considerable influence over the commingling
                    speculations of the time which met in that great centre. Bunsen vindicates his
                    Christian character, and says that St Jerome speaks of him with great respect.
                    If at any time he really belonged to the church, it seems to be admitted
                    (Epiph., <hi rend="italic">Hoer.,</hi> xxxi. 7) that in Cyprus, whither he
                    returned and where he died, he ultimately proclaimed himself outside its pale.
                    The most illustrious disciples of the Valentinian Gnosticism, which »prevailed
                    on till the 6th century, were Ptolemaeus, Heracleon, and Marcus. It is the
                    tenets of these teachers, especially of the first, that are chiefly discussed in
                    the opening chapter of the well-known treatise of Irenaeus.</p>
                <p>(3.) In addition to these two great schools of Gnosticism there is still a third,
                    especially represented by the famous Marcion of Pontus, whose centre may be
                    regarded as Asia Minor. Marcion was the son of a Christian bishop, by whom he is
                    said to have been excommunicated. Following one Cerdon, a Gnostic of Antioch,
                    Marcion distinguished himself by his extreme opposition to Judaism, and
                    generally by a Gnostic attitude at variance with the Old Testament, the God of
                    which is to him the Demiurge in conflict with the Supreme Being and the Christ
                    whom He sent to redeem the world from the power of this Demiurge. His
                    Christology was of course docetic,—the divine power being only united to the man
                    Jesus for a time. He accepted only ten of St Paul’s epistles, and a mutilated
                    copy of the gospel of St Luke. The teaching of the Clementine fictions and a
                    Jewish sect known by the name of Elkesaites, wffiose tenets seem to have
                    resembled this teaching, is considered by Mansel and others to constitute a
                    Judaizing reaction from the Pauline Gnosticism of Marcion.</p>
                <p>Our readers arc referred to special articles for a detailed exposition of these
                    several Gnostic systems. It remains for us here to give a general sketch of the
                    questions which Gnosticism discussed, and the broader features which
                    characterized its main developments.</p>
                <p>III. The fundamental questions with which Gnosticism concerned itself are the
                    same which in all ages have agitated inquiry and baffled speculation, viz., the
                    origin of life and the origin of evil,—how life sprung from the Infinite
                    Source,—how a world so imperfect as this could proceed from a supremely perfect
                    God. The Oriental notion of matter as utterly corrupt is found to pervade all
                    Gnostical systems, and to give so far a common character to their speculations.
                    It may be said to be the ground-principle of Gnosticism.</p>
                <p>Setting out from this principle, all the Gnostics agree in regarding this world
                    as not proceeding immediately from the Supreme Being. A vast gulf, on the
                    contrary, is supposed to separate them. In the general mode in which they
                    conceive this gulf to be occupied they also agree, although with considerable
                    varieties of detail.</p>
                <p>The Supreme Being is regarded as wholly inconceivable and indescribable—as the
                    unfathomable Abyss (Valentinus) —the Unnameable (Basilides). From this
                    transcendent source existence springs by emanation in a series of spiritual
                    powers <hi rend="italic">(f&gt;vvapaf).</hi> It is only through these several
                    powers or energies that the infinite passes into life and activity, and becomes
                    capable of representation. To this higher spiritual world is given the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">πλήρωμα,</hi> and the divine powers composing it, in their
                    ever-expanding procession from the Highest, are called Aeons.</p>
                <p>So far a common mode of representation characterizes all the Gnostical systems.
                    All unite in this doctrine of a higher emanation-world. It is in the passage
                    from this higher spiritual world to the lower material one that a speculative
                    distinction of an important character begins to characterize them. On the one
                    hand, this passage is apprehended as a mere continued degeneracy from the Source
                    of Life, at length terminating in the kingdom of darkness and death—the
                    bordering chaos surrounding the kingdom of light. On the other hand, this
                    passage is apprehended in a more precisely dualistic form, as a positive
                    invasion of the kingdom of light by a self-existent kingdom of darkness.
                    According as Gnosticism adopted one or other of these modes of explaining the
                    existence of the present world, it fell into the two great divisions which, from
                    their places of origin, have received the respective names of the Alexandrian
                    and Syrian Gnosis. The one, as we have seen, presents more a Western, the other
                    more an Eastern type of speculation. The dualistic element in the one case
                    scarcely appears beneath the Pantheistic, and bears resemblance to the Platonic
                    notion of the <hi rend="italic">vλη—</hi> a mere blank necessity, a limiting
                    void. In the other case, the dualistic element is clear and prominent,
                    corresponding to the Zarathustrian doctrine of an active principle of evil as
                    well as of good—of a kingdom of Ahriman (Auro-Mainyus) as well as a kingdom of
                    Ormuzd (Ahura-Mazdâo).</p>
                <p>In the Alexandrian Gnosis a link of subordination is preserved between the two
                    kingdoms, separated as they are. For the <hi rend="italic">vλη</hi> only becomes
                    a living and active power of evil through the quickening impartation of some
                    element from the higher kingdom in its progressive descent from the Supreme
                    Source. The stream of being in its ever-outward flow at length comes in contact
                    with dead matter, which thus receives animation, and becomes a living source of
                    evil. Its life and power, however, are withal only derived from the higher
                    kingdom. But in the Syrian Gnosis the kingdom of darkness has no such dependence
                    upon the kingdom of light. There appears from the first a hostile principle of
                    evil in collision with the good.</p>
                <p>Out of this main distinction other more special distinctions arise, still more
                    clearly defining the one form of γvωσις from the other. According as the two
                    kingdoms are recognized as subordinate the one to the other, or as opposed to
                    each other, it is obvious that different views will prevail as to the character
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Δ-ηpaovpyoς,</hi> or maker of this world, whose name
                    and functions are so prominent in all systems of Gnosticism. In the one case,
                    his relation to the Supreme Source of life will be apprehended as more
                    dependent—in the other, as more hostile. In the former view, the γvωσ-ις, while
                    rising in its pride of speculation far above all mere earthly relations and
                    historical religions, could yet find in these a point of contact, whereby the
                    higher spiritual truth, penetrating this lower world, would gradually raise it
                    to its own elevation. In the latter, no such point of contact is left between
                    nature, or history, and the γvωσις. Accordingly, while the Alexandrian form of
                    Gnosticism was found to embrace Judaism, as a divine institution, although very
                    inferior and defective in its manifestation of the Divine character, the Syrian
                    rejected it as being wholly the work of the spirit of the lower world—the
                    Δημιουργός warring with the supreme God. This anti-Judaical spirit is found
                    developed to its extreme in Marcion.</p>
                <p>The Gnostic conception of Christ, in so far uniform, is also of course greatly
                    modified by the different relations which the systems thus bore to Judaism. In
                    all he is recognized as a higher Aeon, proceeding from the kingdom of light for
                    the redemption of this lower kingdom of darkness. But, in the one case, however
                    superior, he is yet allied to the lower angels and the Δημιουργός, governing
                    this lower world. His appearance, accordingly, admits of being historically
                    connected with the previous manifestations of the Divine presence upon earth.
                    But, in the other case, he is apprehended as a being wholly distinct from the
                    Δημιουργός, and his appearance takes place in this lower world without <pb

                    draw to himself all kindred spiritual natures held in bondage by the power of
                    this lower world. If any point of connexion is admitted in this latter case
                    betwixt Christianity and the lower world, it is certainly not found in Judaism
                    or any historical religion, but in the theosophic schools, where an esoteric
                    knowledge of the Supreme was cultivated.</p>
                <p>IV. Vague, confused, and irrational as Gnosticism in most of its systems is, its
                    influence upon the development of Christian thought was by no means detrimental.
                    It com pelled Christian teachers to face the great problems of which it
                    attempted the solution in so many fantastic forms. It expanded the horizon of
                    controversy within as without the church, and made men like Irenaeus, and
                    Clement, and Origen, and even Tertullian, feel that it was by the weapons of
                    reason and not of authority that they must win the triumph of Catholic
                    Christianity. Gnosticism, therefore, may be said to have laid the foundation of
                    Christian science, and it is certainly interesting and deserving of notice that
                    it is in the two great cities of Antioch and Alexandria, —where Gnosticism had
                    chiefly planted itself,—that we see the rise of the first two schools of
                    Christian thought. These centres of half-Pagan and half-Christian speculation
                    became the first centres of rational Christian theology.</p>
                <p>The several schools of Gnosticism seem to have gradually lost importance after
                    the middle of the 3d century, although some of them continued to linger till the
                    6th century. Manichaeism was little else than a revival of it in the Syrian
                    form, and this system in the 4th and 5th centuries became so powerful as almost
                    to be a rival to Christianity. The great Christian father St Augustine, as is
                    well known, was long fascinated by its influence. Again, strangely, in the 12th
                    century the same spirit burst forth afresh, and in special connexion with the
                    name of the great apostle of the Gentiles. The sect of Paulicians, originating
                    in the old Syrian haunt of heresy, Samosata, spread through Asia Minor, and then
                    through Bulgaria and the borders of the Greek empire into Italy, Germany, and
                    France. Gibbon, in the 54th chapter of his famous <hi rend="italic">Decline and
                    Fall of the Roman Empire,</hi> has given a vivid and powerful description of the
                    fortunes and persecutions of the sect, and the readiness with which its
                    doctrines seized upon whole populations. In southern France especially it spread
                    like wildfire, and for a time almost entirely displaced Catholic Christianity.
                    This Western development of the old Oriental dualism was characterized by many
                    of the features of the earlier Gnosticism, such as the doctrine of the radical
                    evil of matter, aversion to the Old Testament as the work of an evil Demiurge,
                    and a docetic Christology. Extinguished in the horrors of the Albigensian war,
                    it can hardly be said to have reappeared in the history of Christendom.</p>
