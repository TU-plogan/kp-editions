                <p><label type="entry">GORAKHPUR</label>, a district of the North-Western Provinces,
                    India, between 26° 50' 15" and 27° 28' 48" N. lat., and between 83° 7' and 84°
                    29' E. long., bounded on the N. by the territory of Nepàl, on the E. by
                    Champâran and Sâran, on the S. by the Gogra river, and on the W. by Basti and
                    Fyzabad, with an area of 4578 square miles. The district lies immediately south
                    of the lower Himalayan slopes, but forms itself a portion of the great alluvial
                    plain. Only a few sandhills break the monotony of its level surface, which is,
                    however, intersected by numerous rivers studded with lakes and marshes. In the
                    north and centre dense forests abound, and the whole country has a verdant
                    appearance. The principal rivers are the Ràpti, the Gogra, the great and little
                    Gandak, the Kuâna, the Rolim, the Ami, and the Gunghi. The tiger is found in the
                    north, and many other wild animals abound throughout the district. The lakes are
                    well stocked with fish.</p>
                <p>The population, which in 1853 numbered 1,816,390, had risen to 2,019,361 in 1872,
                    a great increase in so short a period; of these, 1,819,445 or 90Ί per cent, are
                    Hindus, 199,372 Mussulmans, and 533 Christians. The district contains a total
                    cultivated area of 2621 square miles, with 897 square miles available for
                    cultivation, most of which is now under forest. The chief products are cotton,
                    rice, <hi rend="italic">bhjrα,</hi><hi rend="italic">joàr,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >moth,</hi> and other food-stuffs. The commerce of Gorakhpur is confined to
                    the above products. The means of communication are still imperfect. Two good
                    metalled roads run. through the district, one from Gorakhpur to Benares tnα
                    Bar-halganj, the other to Basti and Fyzabad. The total revenue in 1876 was
                    £227,738. The police force in 1875 numbered 755 officers and mem In 1875 there
                    were 435 schools, with 13,525 pupils. The district is not subject to very
                    intense heat, from which it is secured by its vicinity to the hills and the
                    moisture of its soil. Dust-storms are rare, and cool breezes from the south,
                    rushing down the gorges of the Himalayas, succeed each short interval of warm
                    weather. The climate is, however, relaxing. The southern and eastern portions
                    are as healthy as most parts of the province, but the <hi rend="italic"
                        >tarai</hi> and forest-tracts are still subject to malaria. The average
                    rainfall from 1860 to 1871 was 45 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 inches; the
                    maximum was 60 inches in 1861, and the minimum 25 inches in 1868. The mean

                <p>Gautama Buddha, the founder of the religion bearing his name, died within the
                    district of Gorakhpur. It thus became the headquarters of the new creed, and was
                    one of the first tracts to receive it. The country from the beginning of the 6th
                    century was the scene of a continuous struggle between the Bhars and their Aryan
                    antagonists, the Rahtors. About 900 the Domhatars or military Brahmans appeared,
                    and expelled the Rahtors from the town of Gorakhpur, but they also were soon
                    driven back by other invaders. During the 15th and 16th centuries, after the
                    district had been desolated by incessant war, the descendants of the various
                    conquerors held parts of the territory, and each seems to have lived quite
                    isolated, as no bridges or roads attest any <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>
                    intercourse with each other. Towards the end of the 16th century, Mussulmans
                    occupied Gorakhpur town, but they interfered very little with the district, and
                    allowed it to be controlled by the native rajas. In the middle of the 18th
                    century a formidable foe, the Banjâras from the west, kept the district in a
                    state of terror, and so weakened the power of the rajas that they could not
                    resist the fiscal exactions of the Oudh officials, who plundered and ravaged the
                    country to a great extent. The district formed part of the territory ceded by
                    Oudh to the British under the treaty of 1801. During the mutiny it was lost for
                    a short time, but under the friendly Gurkhas the rebels were driven out, and the
                    whole district once more passed under British rule.</p>
