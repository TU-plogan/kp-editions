                <p><label type="entry">GLOGAU</label> (sometimes called Gross or Great Glogau, to
                    distinguish it from Klein or Little Glogau, in the government of Oppeln), is a
                    fortified town of Prussia at the head of a circle in the Lower Silesian
                    government of Liegnitz, situated partly on an island and partly on the left bank
                    of the Oder, about 80 miles S.E. of Frankfort. Among its more important
                    buildings are the cathedral, in the Gothic style, and a castle in the
                    Renaissance style, now used as a courthouse; and it also possesses a new
                    town-house, a synagogue, a poorhouse, an orphanage, a military hospital, two
                    gymnasia, and several libraries. Situated as it is on a navigable river and at a
                    junction of two or three railway lines, Glogau carries on an extensive trade,
                    which is fostered by a variety of local industries, dealing with tobacco, beer,
                    oil, sugar, vinegar, bone-meal, earthenware, &amp;c. One of its publishing
                    firms—that of Flemming &amp; Company—has attained a wide reputation for maps. In
                    1871 the population of Glogau, inclusive of the garrison, amounted to 18,266,—
                    of whom 6039 were Roman Catholics and 947 Jews; and in 1875 it was stated at
                    18,062.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the 11th century Glogau, even then a populous and fortified
                    town, was able to withstand a regular siege by the emperor Henry V.; but in 1157
                    the duke of Silesia, finding he could not hold out against Frederick Barbarossa,
                    set the place on fire. In 1252 the town, which had been raised from its ashes by
                    Henry the Bearded, became the capital of a principality of Glogau, which
                    continued till 1506, when town and district were united to the Bohemian crown.
                    In the course of the Thirty Years’ War Glogau suffered greatly. The inhabitants,
                    who had become Protestants soon after the Reformation, were dragooned into
                    conformity by Wallenstein’s soldiery; and the Jesuits received permission to
                    build themselves a church and a college. Captured by the Protestant allies in
                    1632, and recovered by the Imperialists in 1633, the town was again captured by
                    the Swedish general Torstenson in 1642, and continued in Protestant hands till
                    the peace of Westphalia in 164S. In 1741 the Prussians took the place by storm,
                    and during the Seven Years’ War it formed an important centre of operations for
                    the Prussian forces. After the battle of Jena it fell into the hands of the
                    French; and they have reason to be proud of the gallant defence made by Laplane,
                    who held out against the Russian and Prussian besiegers, after the battle of
                    Katzbacb. (August 26, 1813), till the 17th of the following April.</p>
