                <p><label type="entry">GOAT</label>. All the species of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capra</hi> may be divided into two classes, the one being represented by the
                    ibex (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Icex)</hi> and the other the goat. The latter
                    class is subdivided into the aegagrus or wild goat (C⅛&gt;ra <hi rend="italic"
                    >aegagrus)</hi> and the domestic goat <hi rend="italic">{Capra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hircus),</hi> of which there are many varieties.</p>
                <p>The Wild Goat, or Paseng of the Persians <hi rend="italic">{Capra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oegagrus,</hi> Pall.), is an inhabitant of the mountainous regions
                    of Central Asia from the Caucasus to the Himalayas, and is occasionally met with
                    in troops at great elevations. It stands somewhat higher than any of the
                    domesticated varieties of the goat, from which it further differs in its stouter
                    limbs and more slender body. Its neck is short, and is thus fitted to bear the
                    enormous horns, which in the male are larger proportionally than in any other
                    ruminant animal. These measure nearly three feet in length, are obscurely
                    triaugular in form, transversely ridged, and are bent backward as in the
                    domestic varieties. The wild goat of the Himalayas, according to Darwin, when it
                    happens to fall accidentally from a height, makes use of its massive horns by
                    bending forward its head and alighting on them, thus breaking the shock. In the
                    female the horns are exceedingly diminutive, or are altogether awarding. The
                    fur, which over the greater part of the body is short, is of a greyish-brown
                    colour, with a black line running along the entire length of the back; the short
                    tail and the muzzle are also black, while the under surface of the neck, and the
                    beard, which is present in both sexes, are of a brown colour. The paseng is
                    exceedingly wary of the approach of man, and as its agility is no less
                    remarkable there has been little opportunity of studying it closely. The
                    concretions known as <hi rend="italic">l&gt;ezoar-stones,</hi> which were
                    formerly much used in medicine and as antidotes of poison, are believed to have
                    been originally obtained from the intestines of this species.</p>
                <p>Considerable diversity of opinion-has been expressed by naturalists as to the
                    original stock of the domestic goat, which is met with in nearly every quarter
                    of the globe,— the now prevalent and the most probable opinion being that the
                    various domestic breeds are severally descended from wild stock now extinct.
                    Both the ibex and the aegagrus interbreed freely with the common goat, though
                    the produce is not always fertile. Instances of this are not unusual in the Alps
                    and Pyrenees, where goats abound in a semi-domesticated state. Hybrids between
                    the goat and the sheep are also known to have occurred, but are rare.</p>
                <p>The following are the chief domestic breeds, possessing distinct characteristics
                    :—the Common Goat, the Maltese, the Syrian, the Angora, the Cashmere, the Nubian
                    or Egyptian, and the Dwarf Goat of Guinea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Common Goat.—</hi> This has many varieties which differ
                    from each other in length of hair, in colour, and slightly in the configuration
                    of the horns. The ears are more or less upright, sometimes horizontal, but never
                    actually pendent, as in some Asiatic breeds. The horns are rather flat at the
                    base and not unfrequently corrugated; they rise vertically from the head,
                    curving to the rear, and are more or less laterally inclined. The colour varies
                    from a dirty white to a dark-brown, but never black, which indicates Eastern
                    blood. Most of the European countries possess more than one description of the
                    common goat. In the British Isles there are two distinct types, one short and
                    the other long haired. In the former case the lιair is thick and close, with
                    frequently an undercoat resembling wool. The horns are large in the male, and of
                    moderate size in the female, flat at the base and inclining outwards. The head
                    is short and tapering, the forehead flat and wide, and the nose small; the legs
                    strong, thick, and well covered with hair. The colour varies from white or grey
                    to black, but is frequently fawn, with a dark line down the spine and across the
                    shoulders. The other variety owns a shaggy coat, generally of a reddish-black
                    hue, though sometimes grey or pied and occasionally white. The head is long,
                    heavy, and ugly, the nose coarse and prominent, the horns are situated close
                    together, and often continue parallel almost to the extremities, being also
                    large, corrugated, and pointed. The legs are long, and the sides flat, the
                    animal itself being generally gaunt and thin. This breed is peculiar to Ireland,
                    the Welsh being of a similar description, but more often white. The short-haired
                    goat is the English goat proper. From the constant crossing however that takes
                    place between these native breeds and imported foreign specimens, one meets in
                    England with animals possessing very great diversity of form. Both the British
                    breeds and those from abroad are frequently ornamented with two peculiar
                    tassel-like appendages, which hang near together under the throat. It is
                    supposed by many that these ornaments are traceable to some foreign origin; but
                    although there are foreign breeds that possess them, they appear to pertain
                    quite as much to the English native breeds as to those of distant countries, and
                    indeed the peculiarity referred to is mentioned in very old works that describe
                    the goats of the British Islands. The milk produce in the common goat as well as
                    other kinds varies very greatly with individuals. Irish goats often yield a
                    quantity of milk, but the quality is comparatively poor. The goats of France are
                    very similar to those of Britain, varying in length of hair, colour, and
                    character of horns. A French writer describes them as possessing “a particularly
                    neat and compact head, small mouth, horns corrugated, and inclining upwards and
                    outwards, a thin neck, narrow chest, and long body, long but muscular legs, and
                    in colour white, black, fawn, or pied.” The Norway breed is frequently pure
                    white with long hair; it is rather small in size, with small bones, a short
                    rounded body, head small with a prominent forehead, and short, straight,
                    corrugated horns. The facial line is concave. The horns of the male are very
                    large, and curl round after the manner of the wild goat, with a tuft of hair
                    between and in front.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Maltese Goat</hi> has its ears long and wide and perfectly
                    pendulous, hanging down below the jaw. The hair is long and cream-coloured.
                    Specimens of this kind are usually hornless, which is perhaps the cause of it
                    having been called the “Hornless Variety.” It would appear, however, that the
                    absence of these appendages is simply a freak of nature, and not the peculiar
                    characteristic of a particular species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Syrian Goat.—</hi> This breed is met with in various parts
                    of the East, in Lower Egypt, on the shores of the Indian Ocean, and in the
                    island of Madagascar. Both its hair and ears are excessively long, the latter so
                    much so that they are sometimes dipt to prevent their being torn by stones or
                    thorny shrubs. Its horns are somewhat erect and spiral, with an outward
                    bend.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Angora Goat</hi> is often confounded with the Cashmere, but
                    is in reality quite distinct from it. The principal feature of this breed, of
                    which there are two or three varieties, is the length and quantity of its hair,
                    which has a particularly soft and silky texture, covering the whole body and a
                    great part of the legs with close matted ringlets. The horns of the male differ
                    from those of the female, being directed vertically and in shape spiral, whilst
                    in the female they have a horizontal tendency, somewhat like those of a ram. The
                    face has a sheepish expression. The coat is composed of two kinds of hair, the
                    one short and coarse and of the character of hair, which lies close to the skin,
                    the other long and curly and of the nature of wool, forming the outer covering.
                    Both are used by the manufacturer, but the exterior portion, which makes up by
                    far the greater bulk, is much the more valuable. The process of shearing takes
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n732/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0732-0709"/> place in early spring, and is conducted with the
                    utmost care; the average amount of wool yielded by each animal is about 2⅜ lb.
                    The best quality comes from castrated males, the females producing the next
                    best. The annual export of wool from Angora is estimated at about 2,000,000 lb,
                    and its value at £200,000. Large herds are shipped at Constantinople and sent to
                    Cape Colony, where this breed thrives well and is largely propagated, the
                    climate being specially suitable to the perfect development of the wool. A very
                    valuable consignment of these animals arrived in London in May 1879 for
                    transshipment to the Cape, having been procured from different parts of Asia
                    Minor, by means of great personal exertion, by Mr J. B. Evans, a SouthAfrican
                    goat farmer. The wool, or mohair, as it is technically termed, of these goats
                    was remarkably long, fine, and heavy, the average weight of the produce of the
                    herd being reckoned at 6 11) per head. So highly is this breed esteemed by the
                    Turkish farmers that it was with the greatest reluctance they were induced to
                    sell them, and then only at exorbitant prices, some of the males costing £250
                    and females £150. £50 and £60 are common prices for these goats at Angora. Fig.
                    1 is from a photograph of the finest male of the flock, the fleece of which was
                    estimated to weigh when shorn full 15 lb. The breed was introduced at the Cape
                    about 1864. In 1878, according to the customs returns, 1,300,585 lb weight of
                    mohair was exported, of the value of £105,313. The Angora is a bad milker and an
                    indifferent mother, but its flesh is better eating than that of any other breed,
                    and in its native country is preferred to mutton. The kids are born very small,
                    but grow fast, and arrive early at maturity. This variety of the goat approaches
                    nearest in its nature, form, and habits to the sheep, even the voice having a
                    strong resemblance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cashmere Goat.—</hi> This animal has a delicate head, with
                    semi-pendulous ears, which are both long and wide. The hair varies in length,
                    and is coarse and of different colours according to the individual. The horns
                    are very erect, and sometimes slightly spiral, inclining inwards and to such an
                    extent in some cases as to cross. The coat is composed, as in the Angora, of two
                    materials; but in this breed it is the under coat that partakes of the nature of
                    wool and is valued as an article of commerce. This undergrowth, which is of a
                    uniform greyish-white tint, whatever the colour of the hair may be, is
                    beautifully soft and silky, and of a fluffy description resembling down. It
                    makes its appearance in the autumn, and continues to grow until the following
                    spring, when if not removed, it falls off naturally; its collection then
                    commences, occupying from eight to ten days. The animal undergoes during that
                    time a process of combing by which all the wool and a portion of the hair, which
                    of necessity comes with it, is removed. The latter is afterwards carefully
                    separated, when the fleece in a good specimen weighs about half a pound, being
                    worth between half to three quarters of a rupee. It is sold by the “turruk” of
                    12 lb. This is the material of which the far-famed and costly shawls are made,
                    which at one time had such a demand that, it is stated, “16,000 looms were kept
                    in constant work at Cashmere in their manufacture.” Those goats having a short,
                    neat head, very long, thin ears, a delicate skin, small bones, and a long heavy
                    coat, are for this purpose deemed the best. There are several varieties
                    possessing this valuable quality, but those of Cashmere, Thibet, and Mongolia
                    are the most esteemed. About the year 1816 a small herd of Cashmeres was
                    introduced into France with a view to acclimatize and breed them for the sake of
                    their wool, but the enterprise failed. A few were purchased and brought over to
                    England by Mr C. T. Tower, who, by careful treatment, so far succeeded with them
                    that, in course of time, he had a shawl made from their fleece, which turned out
                    to be of good quality. At the death of the owner some years later, the herd,
                    which had then deteriorated through in-breeding, was presented to the Queen and
                    placed in Windsor Park.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nubian Goat,</hi> which is met with in Nubia, Upper Egypt,
                    and Abyssinia, differs greatly in appearance from all those previously
                    described. The coat is in the female extremely short, almost like that of a
                    race-horse, and the legs are very long. This breed therefore stands considerably
                    higher than the common goat. One of its peculiarities is the strongly convex
                    shape of the face, the forehead being very prominent and the nostrils sunk in,
                    the nose itself extremely small, and the lower lip projecting from the upper.
                    The ears are long, broad, and thin, and hang down by the side of the head like a
                    “double lop ’’ rabbit. The horns are quite black, slightly twisted, and very
                    short, flat at the base, pointed at the tips, and recumbent on the head. But
                    little was known of this breed in Europe—in the West at least—until some ten or
                    twelve years ago, when some were imported into France by the Société
                    d’Acclimatation of Paris, who found its milking qualities to surpass those of
                    all other breeds. Among the goats that are met with in England a good many show
                    unmistakable signs of a more or less remote cross with this breed, derived
                    probably from specimens brought from the East on board ships for supplying milk
                    during the voyage. It is no doubt on this account that they often go by the name
                    of “Indian” goats.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">N^epaul Goat</hi> appears to be a variety of the last
                    breed, it having the same arched facial line, pendulous ears, and long legs. The
                    horns, however, are more spiral. The colour of the hair, which is longer than in
                    the Nubian, is black, grey, or white, with black blotches.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Guinea Goat</hi> is a dwarf species originally from the
                    coast whence its name is derived. There are three varieties. Besides the
                    commonest <hi rend="italic">(Capra</hi><hi rend="italic">recurva,</hi> Linn.),
                    there is a rarer breed <hi rend="italic">(Capra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >depressa,</hi> Linn.), inhabiting the Mauritius and the islands of Bourbon and
                    Madagascar. The other variety is met with along the White Nile, in Lower Egypt,
                    aud at various points on the African coast of the Mediterranean. Some of these
                    dwarf goats may be seen at the Jardin d’Acclimatation in Paris.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Habits and Management.—</hi> The milch goat has been aptly
                    described as the “poor man’s cow ”—a designation it well merits, for with a
                    couple of these animals the cottager may at an almost nominal expense enjoy the
                    same advantages in a domestic point of view as the rich man with his “Alderney.”
                    Comparatively few are kept in England, because the advantages of goat-keeping
                    are but very imperfectly known, and also on account of the large proportion of
                    land under cultivation. The goat in a state of nature frequents hills and
                    mountainous places, and in a domesticated condition it generally gives
                    preference to elevated situations; but it is a mistake to suppose that it will
                    not thrive on low ground. Being naturally adapted to rocks and dry soils,
                    however, it should not be exposed in marshy places, as this brings on disease of
                    the feet and general ill health; otherwise there is no animal more uniformly
                    hardy. The common varieties will stand heat and cold equally well, but have a
                    decided objection to storms of wind and rain; when they are left to roam loose,
                    therefore, a rough shed should be erected to shelter them from the weather.
                    Under this arrangement a goat may be left out day and night the whole year
                    round; but, if it is kept for the sake of its milk, the yield is greater and it
                    thrives better if housed during winter. Owing to the troublesome propensity of
                    these animals to bark trees and destroy shrubs by nipping off all young and
                    tender shoots, they should not be allowed to roam loose—except on a
                    common—unless proper protection is afforded by wire netting or some such
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>The goat breeds, generally speaking, but once a year. If well housed and under
                    liberal treatment, it will bring forth young twice in twelve months; but this is
                    not advisable. As a rule, at the first birth one kid only is produced, but
                    afterwards two and sometimes three. One has been known for three consecutive
                    years to drop four at a birth; but this is rare and by no means desirable, as
                    the progeny are sure to be small and thrive badly,—the dam in most cases having
                    insufficient milk for so large a family.</p>
                <p>The goat propagates at a very early period of its life. The male is generally
                    capable of engendering at seven months; and, in the case just referred to of
                    four at a birth, the father on one occasion was barely six months old. One is
                    sufficient for a hundred females. The latter bring forth at twelve months, and
                    sometimes earlier. For the sake of the future growth and productiveness of the
                    animal, however, it is unwise to permit intercourse between the sexes earlier
                    than at eighteen or at least sixteen months. It is owing to the baneful practice
                    of letting them breed as soon as they will, uuder the mistaken idea that a more
                    rapid return is obtained, that so many diminutive specimens are met with, both
                    dam and progeny being spoiled in consequence.</p>
                <p>The best kind for milch purposes are those with long and deep bodies, not
                    necessarily so broad at the chest as about the haunches, the belly ample, and
                    the legs tolerably short; head fine and tapering, with prominent eyes, ears
                    long, thin, wide, and inclining horizontally, horns short and not corrugated,
                    neck thick, and coat close and short. The udder above all must be not only large
                    but soft and elastic, with nice pointed teats. Hornless specimens are often the
                    best milkers.</p>
                <p>The goat has 32 teeth, and by these the age up to five years may be pretty
                    accurately ascertained. The lower jaw possesses 12 molars aud 8 incisors, and
                    the upper 12 molars alone. The kid at its birth has G molars but no incisors;
                    the latter, however, are generally all cut in about three weeks, the first cut
                    molar being visible at three months. At a year or fifteen months old the two
                    front “milk teeth,” as the first set of incisors are called, fall, and are
                    replaced by permanent ones; the next two at from two years to thirty months, the
                    third pair from two and a half to three and a half years, and the fourth and
                    last at from three and a half to four and a half years. When all are changed the
                    mouth is said to be “full.”</p>
                <p>Between two and five years old the she-goat gives the best return in milk,
                    continuing productive often for eight or nine years; its length of life is on an
                    average from ten to fifteen. These animals vary very greatly in the quantity of
                    milk they yield. An ordinary specimen gives from 2 to 3 pints, a superior one 2
                    quarts, and occasionally first-rate individuals are found supplying 3 quarts a
                    day. The Nubian breed surpasses the common goat in this respect, as the
                    following table from the French work of M. du Plessis will show, in which the
                    yield of a Nubian is compared with that of a half-bred, itself a superior
                    milker.</p>

                <p>The litre being as near as possible 1£ pints, the return in English measure is
                    accordingly—from the half-bred 31 pints, or an average per day of 3 quarts, and
                    from the pure Nubian 40 pints, or nearly 4 quarts daily, the richness of the
                    quality being proportionately greater.</p>
                <p>Milking slιould be performed at regular hours, morning and night; but with heavy
                    milkers three times daily is better for the first two or three months, as the
                    oftener the udder is emptied when once full the quicker it is replenished, a
                    sufficient supply of food being of course provided. It is a good planto accustom
                    the animal to jump on a platform whilst being milked; the teats are thus more
                    easily manipulated, and more command is obtained over the goat and the pail.
                    Feeding and milking should always be carried on at the same time.</p>
                <p>Many persons are under the wrong impression that the milk of the she-goat,—which
                    by the way has no strong <hi rend="italic">hircine</hi> scent attaching to her
                    like the male, another common error,—possesses a flavour peculiar to itself; but
                    this is quite a mistake. Out of dozens kept by the present writer, only one has
                    been found to yield milk differing from that of the cow in taste. The
                    peculiarity in this case seemed natural to the animal, and the milk was
                    decidedly unpalatable.</p>
                <p>The flesh of the common goat, although quite eatable, is not to be recommended in
                    comparison with mutton, being rather hard and indigestible. Kid, however, is a
                    great delicacy, and tastes like lamb or veal, according to the manner of
                    dressing. It is preferable cooked like veal, with layers of bacon tied round and
                    stuffed, for with the exception of the suet there is very little fat. A good
                    rich gravy should accompany the joint when served, and there should be no lack
                    of cooking. Hot or cold it is then equally acceptable. Suckling kids are the
                    best eating, as they have then their milk flesh, and are nice and plump. The
                    skins dressed and sewed together make handsome rugs. For food and other remarks
