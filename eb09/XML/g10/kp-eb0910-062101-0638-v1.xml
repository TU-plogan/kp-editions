                    (1750-1831), American philanthropist, was born at Bordeaux on 21st May 1750. At
                    the age of thirteen he commenced life as a sailor, and followed his avocation
                    with such assiduity that he was enabled, before the French requisitions of age
                    and service allowed, to become master and captain, in October 1773. His first
                    mercantile venture was to St Domingo in February 1774, whence he proceeded in
                    July to the then colony of New York. After trading for three years between New
                    York, New Orleans, and Port au Prince, he went to Philadelphia in May 1777, and
                    gave up the sea for a mercantile career. While he was engaged most successfully
                    in the prosecution of an. extensive trade, the yellow fever in its most
                    malignant type broke out in Philadelphia, sweeping away one-sixth of its
                    population. When, during its height, a hospital was established, for which it
                    seemed almost impossible to secure competent management, Girard devoted himself
                    personally, fearless of all risks, to the care of the sick and the burial of the
                    dead, not only in the hospital, of which he became manager, but throughout the
                    city, supplying the poorer sufferers with money and provisions. Two hundred
                    children, made orphans by the ravages of the fever, were in a great measure
                    thrown upon his care. From this period his success commercially and financially
                    was unexampled. He gave a portion of his time to the management of municipal
                    affairs for several years, and rendered efficient service as warden of the port
                    and as director of many public institutions. On the dissolution of the Bank of
                    the United States, he instituted what is known now as the Girard Bank. During
                    the war of 1812 “he rendered valuable services to the Government by placing at
                    its disposal the resources of his bank at a time of difficulty and
                    embarrassment, subscribing to a large loan which the Government had vainly
                    sought to obtain.” Girard added to his other avocations that of a practical
                    agriculturist. He died December 26, 1831.</p>
                <p>Girard College was founded by him for the education and support of the poor white
                    orphans of his adopted city. His fortune amounted to about seven and a half
                    millions of dollars. After specific legacies of two millions for the erection
                    and endowment of the college, $140,000 to his relatives, $300,000 to the State
                    for internal improvements, $500,000 to the city of Philadelphia to improve its
                    eastern front, $116,000 to public charities, and various annuities and legacies,
                    he bequeathed the residue of his estate to the city of Philadelphia, mainly for
                    the improvement and maintenance of the college. The most minute directions were
                    given by Girard in regard to the buildings to be erected, and the admission and
                    management of the inmates. He specifically requires that the orphans be
                    instructed in the purest principles of morality, so that on their entrance into
                    active life they may evince benevolence towards their fellow creatures, and a
                    love for truth, sobriety, and industry. As for religious belief they are left to
                    adopt such tenets as their matured reason may lead them to prefer; and to secure
                    this he interdicts the employment, and even the admission into the grounds, of
                    any ecclesiastic whatever.</p>
