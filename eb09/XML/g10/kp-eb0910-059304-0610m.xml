                    Romans began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces, the Capitol
                    being the first place on which this enrichment was bestowed. But he adds that
                    luxury advanced on them so rapidly that in a little time you might see all, even
                    private and poor persons, gild the walls, vaults, and other parts of their
                    dwellings. Owing to the compara-live<pb break="no"

                    gilding, the traces of it which yet remain are remarkably brilliant and solid.
                    Gilding has in all times occupied an important place in the ornamental arts of
                    Oriental countries; and the native processes pursued in India at the present day
                    may be taken as typical of the art as practised from the earliest periods. For
                    the gilding of copper, employed in the decoration of temple domes and other
                    large works, the following is an outline of the processes employed. The metal
                    surface is thoroughly scraped, cleaned, and polished, and next heated in a fire
                    sufficiently to remove any traces of grease or other impurity which may remain
                    from the operation of polishing. It is then dipped in an acid solution prepared
                    from dried unripe apricots, and rubbed with pumice or brick powder. Next, the
                    surface is rubbed over with mercury which forms a superficial amalgam with the
                    copper, after which it is left some hours in clean water, again washed with the
                    acid solution, and dried. It is now ready for receiving the gold, which is laid
                    on in leaf, and, on adhering, assumes a grey appearance from combining with the
                    mercury, but on the application of heat the latter metal volatilizes, leaving
                    the gold a dull greyish hue. The colour is brought up by means of τubbing with
                    agate burnishers. The weight of mercury used in this process is double that of
                    the gold laid on, and the thickness of the gilding is regulated by the
                    circumstances or necessities of the case. For the gilding of iron or steel, the
                    surface is first scratched over with chequered lines, then washed in a hot
                    solution of green apricots, dried, and heated just short.of red-heat. The
                    gold-leaf is then laid on, and rubbed in with agate burnishers, when it adheres
                    by catching into the prepared scratched surface.</p>
                <p>Modern gilding is applied to numerous and diverse surfaces and by various
                    distinct processes, so that the art is prosecuted in many .ways, and is part of
                    widely different ornamental and useful arts. It forms an important and essential
                    part of frame-making (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Carving and Gilding);</hi> it is
                    largely employed in connexion with cabinet-work, decorative painting, and house
                    ornamentation; and it also bulks largely in bookbinding and ornamental leather
                    work. Further, gilding is much employed for coating baser metals, as in
                    button-making, in the gilt toy trade, in electro-gilt reproductions, and in
                    electro-plating; and it is also a characteristic feature in the decoration of
                    pottery, porcelain, and glass. As details of the processes employed in connexion
                    with these various substances will be found in the parts of this work where the
                    technical processes to which they are related are described, it is only
                    necessary here to indicate how the processes of gilding differ from each
                    other.</p>
                <p>The various processes fall under one or other of two heads—mechanical gilding and
                    gilding by chemical agency.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanical Gilding</hi> embraces all the operations by which
                    gold-leaf is prepared (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gold-Beating),</hi> and the
                    several processes by which it is mechanically attached to the surfaces it is
                    intended to cover. It thus embraces the burnish or water-gilding and the
                    oil-gilding of the carver and gilder, and the gilding operations of the house
                    decorator, the sign-painter, the bookbinder, the paper-stainer, and several
                    others. Polished iron, steel, and other metals are gilt mechanically by applying
                    gold-leaf to the metallic surface at a temperature just under red-heat, pressing
                    the leaf on with a burnisher, and reheating, when additional leaf may be laid
                    on. The process is completed by cold burnishing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chemical Gilding</hi> embraces those processes in which the
                    gold used is at some stage in a state of chemical combination. Of these the
                    following are the principal:—</p>
                <p>Cold Gilding.—In this process the gold is obtained in a state of extremely fine
                    division from a chemical compound, and applied by mechanical means. Cold gilding
                    on silver is performed by a solution of gold in aqua-regia, applied by dipping a
                    linen rag into the solution, burning it, and rubbing the black and heavy ashes
                    on the silver with the finger or a piece of leather or cork. Wet gilding is
                    effected by means of a solution of gold in ether, obtained by treating a dilute
                    solution of chloride of gold with twice its quantity of ether. The liquids are
                    agitated and allowed to rest, when the ether separates and floats on the surface
                    of the acid. The whole mixture is then poured into a funnel with a small
                    aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off and the
                    ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the
                    acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is
                    polished with the finest emery and spirits of wine. The ether is then applied
                    with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be
                    heated and polished. For small delicate figures a pen or a fine brush may be
                    used for laying on the ether solution. Fire-gilding or Wash-gilding is a process
                    by which an amalgam of gold is applied to metallic surfaces, the mercury being
                    subsequently volatilized, leaving a film of gold or, according to Struve, an
                    amalgam containing from 13 to 16 per cent, of mercury. In the preparation of the
                    amalgam the gold must first be reduced to thin plates or grains, which are
                    heated red hot, and thrown into mercury previously heated, till it begins to
                    smoke. Upon stirring the mercury with an iron rod, the gold totally disappears.
                    The proportion of mercury to gold is generally as six or eight to one. When the
                    amalgam is cold it is squeezed through chamois leather for the purpose of
                    separating the superfluous mercury; the gold, with about twice its weight of
                    mercury, remains behind, forming a yellowish silvery mass of the consistence of
                    butter. When the metal to be gilt is wrought or chased, it ought to be covered
                    with quicksilver betöre the amalgam is applied, that this may be more easily
                    spread; but when the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam may be applied
                    to it direct. When no such preparation is applied, the surface to be gilded is
                    simply bitten and cleaned with nitric acid. A deposit of mercury is obtained on
                    a metallic surface by means of “quicksilver water,” a solution of nitrate of
                    mercury,—the nitric acid attacking the metal to which it is applied, and thus
                    leaving a film of free metallic mercury. The amalgam being equally spread over
                    the prepared surface of the metal, the mercury is then sublimed by a heat just
                    sufficient for that purpose; for, if it is too great, part of the gold may be
                    driven off, or it may run together and leave some of the surface of the metal
                    bare. When the mercury has evaporated, which is known by the surface having
                    entirely become of a dull yellow colour, the metal must undergo other
                    operations, by which the fine gold colour is given to it. First, the gilded
                    surface is rubbed with a scratch brush of brass wire, until its surface be
                    smooth; then it is covered over with a composition called “gilding wax,” and
                    again exposed to the fire until the wax is burnt off. This wax is composed of
                    beeswax mixed with some of the following substances, viz., red ochre, verdigris,
                    copper scales, alum, vitriol, borax; but, according to Dr Lewis, the saline
                    substances alone are sufficient, without any wax. By this operation the colour
                    of the gilding is heightened; and the effect seems to be produced by a perfect
                    dissipation of some mercury remaining after the former operation. The
                    dissipation is well effected by this equable application of heat. The gilt
                    surface is then covered over with a saline composition, consisting of nitre,
                    alum, or other vitriolic salts, groumbtogether, and mixed up into a paste with
                    water or weak ammonia. The piece of metal thus covered is exposed to a certain
                    degree of heat, and then quenched in water. By this method its colour is further
                    improved and brought nearer to that of gold, probably by removing any particles
                    of copper that may have been on the gilt surface. This process, when skilfully
                    carried out. produces gilding of great solidity and beauty; but owing to the
                    exposure of the workmen to mercurial fumes, it is very unhealthy, and further
                    there is much loss of mercury. Numerous contrivances have been introduced to
                    obviate these serious evils; and the gilding furnace invented by Μ. D’Arcet is
                    so arranged that the whole of the mercurial fumes are caught and recondensed for
                    further use. Gilt brass buttons used for uniforms are gilt by this process, and
                    there is an Act of Parliament yet unrepealed which prescribes 5 grains of gold
                    as the smallest quantity that may be used for the gilding of 12 dozen of buttons
                    1 inch in diameter.</p>
                <p>Electro-gilding, which has numerous and important applications, is described

                <p>Gilding of Pottemjfand Porcelain.— The quantity of gold consumed for these
                    purposes is very large. The gold used is dissolved in aqua-regia, and the acid
                    is driven off <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> by heat, or the gold may be
                    precipitated by means of sulphate of iron. In this pulverulent state the gold is
                    mixed with <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛tli of its weight of oxide of bismuth,
                    together with a small quantity of borax and gum water. The mixture is applied to
                    the articles with a camel’s hair pencil, and after passing through the fire the
                    gold is of a dingy colour, but the lustre is brought out by burnishing with
                    agate and bloodstone, and afterwards cleaning with vinegar or white-lead.</p>
