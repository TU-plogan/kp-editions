                    and a “higher” part. The contents and limits of the former have been fixed by
                    Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> The latter included at the time of the
                    Greek mathematicians principally the properties of the conic sections and of a
                    few other curves. The methods used in both were essentially the same. These
                    began to be replaced during the 17 th century by more powerful methods, invented
                    by Roberval, Pascal, Desargues, and others. But the impetus which higher
                    geometry received in their works was soon arrested, in consequence of the
                    discoveries of Descartes,—the new calculus to which these gave rise absorbing
                    the attention of mathematicians almost exclusively, until Monge, at the end of
                    the 18th century, re-established “pure” as distinguished from Descartes’s
                    “coordinate” (or analytical) geometry. Since then the purely geometrical methods
                    have been continuously extended, especially by Poncelet, Steiner, Von Staudt,
                    and Cremona, and in England by Hirst and Henry Smith, to mention only a few of
                    the leading names.</p>
                <p>Whilst higher geometry thus made most rapid progress, the elementary part
                    remained almost unaltered. It has been taught up to the present day on the basis
                    of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> the latter being either used
                    directly as a textbook (in England), or being replaced (in most parts of the
                    Continent) by text-books which are essentially Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> rewritten, with a few additions about the mensuration of the
                    circle, cone, cylinder, and sphere. Only within a very recent period have
                    attempts been made to change the character of the elementary part by introducing
                    some of the modern methods.</p>
                <p>We shall give in this article—first, a survey of elementary geometry as contained
                    in Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> and then, in form of an independent
                    treatise, an introduction to higher geometry, based on modern methods. In the
                    former part we shall suppose that a copy of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> is in the hands of the reader, so that we may dispense, as a
                    rule, with giving proofs or drawing figures. We thus shall give only the
                    contents of his propositions grouped together in such a way as to show their
                    connexion, and often expressed in words which differ from the verbal translation
                    in order to make their meaning clear. It will make little difference which of
                    the many English editions of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> the reader
                    takes. Of these we may mention Simeon’s, Potts’s, and Todliunter’s.</p>

                    Euclidian Geometry.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Axioms.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 1. The object of geometry is to investigate the properties of space. The first
                    step must consist in establishing those fundamental properties from which all
                    others follow by processes of deductive reasoning. They are laid down in the
                    Axioms, and these ought to form such a system that nothing need be added to them
                    in order fully to characterize space, and that nothing may be left out without
                    making the system incomplete. They must, in fact, completely “define” space.
                    Several such systems are conceivable. Euclid has given one, others have been put
                    forward in recent times by Riemann <hi rend="italic">(Abhandl.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der königl.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gesellsch.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >zu</hi><hi rend="italic">Göttingen,</hi> vol. xiii.), by Helmholz <hi
                    rend="italic">(Göttinger Nachrichten,</hi> June 1868), and by Grassmann <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ausdehnungslehre</hi><hi rend="italic">von</hi> 1844). How many
                    axioms the system ought to contain» and which system is the simplest, may be
                    said to be still an open question. We shall consider only Euclid s system.</p>
                <p>§ 2. The axioms are obtained from inspection of space and of solids in
                    space,—hence from experience. The same source gives us the notions of the
                    geometrical entities to which the axioms relate, viz., solids, surfaces, lines
                    or curves, and points. A solid is directly given by experience; we have only to
                    abstract all material from it in order to gain the notion of a geometrical
                    solid. This has shape, size, position, and may be moved. Its boundary or
                    boundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of space from another,
                    and are said to have no thickness. Their boundaries are curves or lines, and
                    these have length only. Their boundaries, again, are points, which have no
                    magnitude but only position. We thus come in three steps from solids to points
                    which have no magnitude; in each step we lose one extension. Hence we say a
                    solid has three dimensions, a surface two, a line one, and a point none. Space
                    itself, of which a solid forms only a part, is also said to be of three
                    dimensions. The same thing is intended to be expressed by saying that a solid
                    has length, breadth, and thickness, a surface length and breadth, a line length
                    only, and a point no extension whatsoever.</p>
                <p>Euclid gives the essence of these statements as definitions :—</p>

                    generate these entities by moving a point, a line, or a surface, thus :—</p>

                <p>And we may then assume that the lines, surfaces, and solids, as defined before,
                    can all be generated in this manner. From this generation of the entities it
                    follows again that the boundaries—the first and last position of the moving
                    element—of a line are points, and so on; and thus wo come back to the
                    considerations with which we started.</p>
                <p>Euclid points this out in his definitions,—Def. 3, I., Def. 6, I., and Def. 2,
                    XI. He does not, however, show the connexion which these definitions have with
                    those mentioned before. When points and lines have been defined, a statement
                    like Def. 3, I., “The extremities of a line are points,” is a proposition which
                    either has to be proved, and then it is a theorem, or which has to be taken for
                    granted, in which case it is an axiom. And so with Def. 6, I., and Def. 2,
                    XI.</p>
                <p>§ 3. Euclid’s definitions mentioned above are attempts to describe, in a few
                    words, notions which we have obtained by inspection of and abstraction from
                    solids. A few more notions have to be added to these, principally those of the
                    simplest line—the straight line, and of the simplest surface —the flat surface
                    or plane. These notions we possess, but to define them accurately is difficult.
                    Euclid’s Definition 4, I., “A straight line is that which lies evenly between
                    its extreme points,” must be meaningless to any one who has not the notion of
                    straightness in his mind. Neither does it state a property of the straight line
                    which can be used in any further investigation. Such a property is given in
                    Axiom 10, I. It is really this axiom, together <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0390-0377"/> with Postulates 2 and 3, which characterizes the
                    straight line.</p>
                <p>Whilst for the straight line the verbal definition and axiom are kept apart,
                    Euclid mixes them up in the case of the plane. Here the Definition 7, L,
                    includes an axiom. It defines a plane as à surface which has the property that
                    every straight line which joins any two points in it lies altogether in the
                    surface. But if we take a straight line and a point in such a surface, and draw
                    all straight lines which join the latter to all points in the first line, the
                    surface will be fully determined. This construction is therefore sufficient as a
                    definition. That every other straight line which joins any two points in this
                    surface lies altogether in it is a further property, and to assume it gives
                    another axiom.</p>
                <p>Thus a number of Euclid’s axioms are hidden among his first definitions. A still
                    greater confusion exists in the present editions of Euclid between the
                    postulates and axioms so-called, but this is due to later editors and not to
                    Euclid himself. The latter had the last three axioms put together with the
                    postulates <hi rend="italic">(alτημaτfi),</hi> so that these were meant to
                    include all assumptions relating to space. The remaining assumptions which
                    relate to magnitudes in general, viz., the first eight “axioms” in modern
                    editions, were called “common notions” <hi rend="italic">(κoιvai</hi> twoιαι).
                    Of the latter a few may be said to be definitions. Thus the eighth might be
                    taken as a definition of “equal,” and the seventh of halves. If we wish to
                    collect the axioms used in Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> we have
                    therefore to take the three postulates, the last three axioms as generally
                    given, a few axioms hidden in the definitions, and an axiom used by Euclid in
                    the proof of Prop. 4 and on a few other occasions, viz., that figures may be
                    moved in space without change of shape or size.</p>
                <p>We shall not enter into the investigation how far the assumptions which would be
                    included in such a list are sufficient, and how far they are necessary. It may
                    be sufficient here to state that from the beginning of a geometrical science to
                    the present century attempts without end have been made to prove the last of
                    Euclid’s axioms, that only at the beginning of the present century the futility
                    of this attempt was shown, and that only within the last twenty years the true
                    nature of the connexion between the axioms has become known through the
                    researches of Riemann and Helmholz, although Grassmann had published already, in
                    1844, his classical but long-neglected <hi rend="italic">A usdehnungsleh
                    re.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 4. The assumptions actually made by Euclid may be stated as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Straight lines exist which have the property that any one of them may be
                    produced both ways without limit, that through any two points in space such a
                    line may be drawn, and that any two of them coincide throughout their indefinite
                    extensions as soon as two points in the one coincide with two points in the
                    other. (This gives the contents of Def. 4, part of Def. 35, the first two
                    Postulates, and Axiom 10.)</p>
                <p>2. Plane surfaces or planes exist having the property laid down in Def. 7, that
                    every straight line joining any two points in such a surface lies altogether in
                    it.</p>
                <p>3. Right angles, as defined in Def. 10, are possible, and all right angles are
                    equal; that is to say, wherever in space we take a plane, and wherever in that
                    plane we construct a right angle, all angles thus constructed will be equal, so
                    that any one of them may be made to coincide with any other. (Axiom 11.)</p>
                <p>4. The 12th Axiom of Euclid. This we shall not state now, but only introduce it
                    when we cannot proceed any further without it.</p>
                <p>5. Figures may be . freely moved in space without change of shape or size. This
                    is assumed by Euclid, but not stated as an axiom.</p>
                <p>6. In any plane a circle may be described, having any point in that plane as
                    centre, and its distance from any other point in that plane as radius.
                    (Postulate 3.)</p>
                <p>The definitions which have not been mentioned are all “nominal definitions,” that
                    is to say, they fix a name for a thing described. Many of them overdetermine a
                    figure. (Compare notes to definitions in Simson’s or Todhunter’s edition.)</p>
                <p>§ 5. Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> are contained in thirteen books. Of
                    these the first four and the sixth are devoted to “plane geometry,” as the
                    investigation of figures in a plane is generally called. Tlιe õth book contains
                    the theory of proportion which is used in Book VI. The 7th, 8th, and 9th books
                    are purely arithmetical, whilst the 10th contains a most ingenious treatment of
                    geometrical irrational quantities. These four books will be excluded from our
                    survey. The remaining three books relate to figures in space, or, as it is
                    generally called, to “solid geometry.” The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, l3th, and part
                    of the 11th and 12th books are now generally omitted from the school editions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> In the first four and in the 6th book it is
                    to be understood that all figures are drawn in a plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> I. <hi rend="smallcaps">of Euclid’s
                    “Elements.”</hi></p>
                <p>§ 6. According to the third postulate it is possible to draw in any plane a
                    circle which has its centre at any given point, and its radius equal to the
                    distance of this point from any other point given in the plane. This makes it
                    possible (Prop. 1) to construct on a given line AB an equilateral triangle, by
                    drawing first a circle with A as centre and AB as radius, and then a circle with
                    B as centre and BA as radius. The point where these circles intersect—that they
                    intersect Euclid quietly assumes—is the vertex of the required triangle. Euclid
                    does not suppose, however, that a circle may be drawn which has its radius equal
                    to the distance between any two points unless one of the points be the centre.
                    This implies also that we are not supposed to be able to make any straight line
                    equal to any other straight line, or to carry a distance about in space. Euclid
                    therefore next solves the problem: It is required along a given straight line
                    from a point in it to set off a distance equal to the length of another straight
                    line given anywhere in the plane. This is done in two steps. It is shown in
                    Prop. 2 how a straight line may be drawn from a given point equal in length to
                    another given straight line not drawn from that point. And then the problem
                    itself is solved in Prop. 3, by drawing first through the given <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> point some straight line of the required length, and
                    then about the same point as centre a circle having this length as radius. This
                    circle will cut off from the given straight line a length equal to the required
                    one. Now-a-days, instead of going through this long process, we take a pair of
                    compasses and set off the given length by its aid. This assumes that we may move
                    a length about without changing it. But Euclid has not assumed it, and this
                    proceeding would be fully justified by his desire not to take for granted more
                    than was necessary, if he were not obliged at his very next step actually to
                    make this assumption, though without stating it.</p>
                <p>§ 7. We now come (in Prop. 4) to the first theorem. It is the fundamental theorem
                    of Euclid’s whole system, there being only a very few propositions (like Props.
                    13, 14,15, I.), except those in the 5th book and the first half of the 11th,
                    which do not depend upon it. It is stated very accurately, though somewhat
                    clumsily, as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides
                    of the other, each to each, and have also the angles contained by those sides
                    equal to one another, they shall also have their bases or third sides equal; and
                    the two triangles shall be equal; and their other angles shall be equal, each to
                    each, namely, those to which the equal sides are opposite.</hi></p>
                <p>That is to say, the triangles are “identically” equal, and one may be considered
                    as a copy of the other. The proof is very simple. The first triangle is taken up
                    and placed on the second, so that the parts of the triangles which are known to
                    be equal fall upon each other. It is then easily seen that also the remaining
                    parts of one coincide with those of the other, and that they are therefore
                    equal. This process of applying one figure to another Euclid scarcely uses
                    again, though many proofs would be simplified by doing so. The process
                    introduces motion into geometry, and includes, as already stated, the axiom that
                    figures may be moved without change of shape or size.</p>
                <p>If the last proposition be applied to an isosceles triangle, which has two sides
                    equal, we obtain the theorem (Prop. 5), <hi rend="italic">if two sides of a
                    triangle are equal, then the angles opposite these sides are equal.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid’s proof is somewhat complicated, and a stumbling-block to many schoolboys.
                    The proof becomes much simpler if we consider the isosceles triangle ABC (AB=AC)
                    twice over, once as a triangle BAG, and once as a triangle CAB; and now remember
                    that <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0391-0378"/> AB, AC in the first are equal respectively to AC,
                    AB in the second, and the angles included by these sides are equal. Hence the
                    triangles are equal, and the angles in the one are equal to those in the other,
                    viz., those which are opposite equal sides, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> angle
                    ABC in the first equals angle ACB in the second, as they are opposite the equal
                    sides AC, and AB in the two triangles.</p>
                <p>There follows the converse theorem (Prop. 6). <hi rend="italic">If two angles in
                    a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite them are equal,—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the triangle is isosceles. The proof given consists in
                    what is called a <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">absurdum,</hi> a kind of proof often used by Euclid, and
                    principally in proving the converse of a previous theorem. It assumes that the
                    theorem to be proved is wrong, and then shows that this assumption leads to an
                    absurdity, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to a conclusion which is in
                    contradiction to a proposition proved before— that therefore the assumption made
                    cannot be true, and hence that the theorem is true. It is often stated that
                    Euclid invented this kind of proof, but the method is most likely much
                    older.</p>
                <p>§ 8. It is next proved <hi rend="italic">that two triangles which have the three
                    sides of the· one equal respectively to those of the other are identically
                    equal, hence that the angles of the one are equal respectively to those of the
                    other, those being equal which are opposite equal sides.</hi> This is Prop. 8,
                    Prop. 7 containing only a first step towards its proof.</p>
                <p>These theorems allow now of the solution of a number of problems, viz.:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To bisect a given angle</hi> (Prop. 9).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To bisect a given finite straight line</hi> (Prop. 10).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To draw a straight line perpendicularly to a given straight
                    line through a given point in it</hi> (Prop. 11), <hi rend="italic">and also
                    through a given point not in it</hi> (Prop. 12).</p>
                <p>The solutions all depend upon properties of isosceles triangles.</p>
                <p>§ 9. The next three theorems relate to angles only, and might have been proved
                    before Prop. 4, or even at the very beginning. The first (Prop. 13) says, <hi
                    rend="italic">The angles which one straight line makes with another straight
                    line on one side of it either are two right angles or are together equal to two
                    right angles.</hi> This theorem would have been unnecessary if Euclid had
                    admitted the notion of an angle such that its two limits are in the same
                    straight line, and had besides defined the sum of two angles.</p>
                <p>Its converse (Prop. 14) is of great use, inasmuch as it enables us in many cases
                    to prove that two straight lines drawn from the same point are one the
                    continuation of the other. So also is</p>
                <p>Prop. 15. <hi rend="italic">If two straight lines cut one another, the vertical
                    or opposite angles shall be equal.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 10. Euclid returns now to properties of triangles. Of great importance for the
                    next steps (though afterwards superseded by a more complete theorem) is</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. <hi rend="italic">If one side of a triangle be produced, the exterior
                    angle shall be greater than either of the interior opposite angles.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 17, <hi rend="italic">Any two angles of a triangle are together less than
                    two right angles,</hi> is an immediate consequence of it. By the aid of these
                    two, the following fundamental properties of triangles are easily proved :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 18. <hi rend="italic">The greater side of every triangle has the greater
                    angle opposite to it;</hi></p>
                <p>Its converse, Prop. 19. <hi rend="italic">The greater angle of every triangle is
                    subtended by the greater side, or has the greater side opposite to it;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">Any two sides of a triangle are together greater than
                    the third side;</hi></p>
                <p>And also Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">If from the ends of the side of a triangle
                    there be drawn two straight lines to a point within the triangle, these shall be
                    less than the other two sides of the triangle, but shall contain a greater
                    angle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 11. Having solved two problems (Props. 22,23), he returns to two triangles
                    which have two sides of the one equal respectively to two sides of the other. It
                    is known (Prop. 4) that if the included angles are equal then the third sides
                    are equal; and conversely (Prop. 8), if the third sides are equal, then the
                    angles included by the first sides are equal. From this it follows that if the
                    included angles are not equal, the third sides are not equal, and conversely,
                    that if the third sides are not equal, the included angles are not equal. Euclid
                    now completes this knowledge by proving, that <hi rend="italic">“if the included
                    angles are not equal, then the third side in that triangle is the greater which
                    contains the greater angle;"</hi> and conversely, that <hi rend="italic">“if the
                    third sides are unequal, that triangle contains the grecder angle which contains
                    the greater side"</hi> These are Prop. 24 and Prop. 25.</p>
                <p>§ 12. The next theorem (Prop. 26) says thati/ <hi rend="italic">two triangles
                    have one side and two angles of the one equal respectively to one side and two
                    angles of the other, viz., in both triangles either the angles adjacent to the
                    equal side, or one angle adjacent and one angle opposite it, then the two
                    triangles are identically equal.</hi></p>
                <p>This theorem belongs to a group with Prop. 4 and Prop. 8. Its first case might
                    have been given immediately after Prop. 4, but the second case requires Prop. 16
                    for its proof.</p>
                <p>§ 13. We come now to the investigation of parallel straight lines, i.e., of
                    straight lines which lie in the same plane, and cannot be made to meet however
                    far they be produced either way. The investigation, which starts from Prop. 16,
                    will become clearer if a few names be explained which are not all used by
                    Euclid. If two straight lines be cut by a third, the latter is now generally
                    called a “transversal” of the figure. It forms at the two points where it cuts
                    the given lines four angles with each. Those of the angles which lie between the
                    given lines are called interior angles, and of these, again, any two which lie
                    on opposite sides of the transversal but one at each of the two points are
                    called “alternate angles.”</p>
                <p>We may now state Prop. 16 thus :— <hi rend="italic">If two straight lines which
                    meet are cut by a transversal, their alternate angles are unequal.</hi> For the
                    lines will form a triangle, and one of the alternate angles will be an exterior
                    angle to the triangle, the other interior and opposite to it.</p>
                <p>From this follows at once the theorem contained in Prop. 27. <hi rend="italic">If
                    two straight lines which are cut by a transversal make alternate angles equal,
                    the lines cannot meet, however far they be produced, hence they are
                    parallel.</hi> This proves the existence of parallel lines.</p>
                <p>Prop. 28 states the same fact in different forms. <hi rend="italic">If a
                    straight</hi><hi rend="italic">Une,</hi><hi rend="italic">falling on two other
                    straight lines, make the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle
                    on the same side of the line, or make the interior angles on the same side
                    together equal to two right angles, the two straight lines shall be parallel to
                    one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence we know that, “if two straight lines which are cut by a transversal meet,
                    their alternate angles are not equal”; and hence that, “if alternate angles are
                    equal, then the lines are parallel.”</p>
                <p>The question now arises, Are the propositions converse to these true or not? That
                    is to say, ‘ ‘ If alternate angles are unequal, do the lines meet?” And “if the
                    lines are parallel, are alternate angles necessarily equal ?”</p>
                <p>The answer to either of these two questions implies the answer to the other. But
                    it has been found impossible to prove that the negation or the affirmation of
                    either is true.</p>
                <p>The difficulty which thus arises is overcome by Euclid assuming that the first
                    question has to be answered in the affirmative. This gives his last axiom (12),
                    which we quote in his own words.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Axiom</hi> 12.— <hi rend="italic">If a straight line meet
                    two straight lines, so as to make the two Ulterior angles on the same side of it
                    taken together less than two right angles, these straight lines, being
                    continually produced, shall at length meet on that side on which are the angles
                    which are less than two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>The answer to the second of the above questions follows from this, and gives the
                    theorem Prop. 29. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line fall on two parallel
                    straight lines, it makes the alternate angles equal to one another, and the
                    exterior</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic">angle equal to the
                    interior and opposite angle on the same side, and also the two interior angles
                    on the same side together equal to two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 14. With this a new part of elementary geometry begins. The earlier
                    propositions are independent of this axiom, and would be true even if a wrong
                    assumption had been made in it. They all relate to figures in a plane. But a
                    plane is only one among an infinite number of conceivable surfaces. We may draw
                    figures on any one of them and study their properties. We may, for instance,
                    take a sphere instead of the plane, and obtain “spherical” in the place of
                    “plane” geometry. If on one of these surfaces lines and figures could be drawn,
                    answering to all the definitions of our plane figures, and if the axioms with
                    the exception of the last all hold, then all propositions up to the 28th will be
                    true for these figures. This is the case in spherical geometry if we substitute
                    “shortest line” or “great circle” for “straight line,” “small circle” for
                    “circle,” and if, besides, we limit all figures to a part of the sphere which is
                    less than a hemisphere, so that two points on it cannot be opposite ends of a
                    diameter, and therefore determine always one and only one great circle.</p>
                <p>For spherical triangles, therefore, all the important propositions 4, 8, 26; 5
                    and 6; and 18, 19, and 20 will hold good.</p>
                <p>This remark will be sufficient to show the impossibility of proving Euclid’s last
                    axiom, which would mean proving that this axiom is a consequence of the others,
                    and hence that the theory of parallels would hold on a spherical surface, where
                    the other axioms do hold, whilst parallels do not even exist.</p>
                <p>It follows that the axiom in question states an inherent difference between the
                    plane and other surfaces, and that the plane is only fully characterized when
                    this axiom is added to the other assumptions.</p>
                <p>§ 15. The introduction of the new axiom and of parallel lines leads to a new
                    class of propositions.</p>
                <p>After proving (Prop. 30) that <hi rend="italic">“two lines which are each
                    parallel to a third are parallel to each other</hi>,” we obtain the new
                    properties of triangles contained in Prop. 32. Of these the second part is the
                    most important, viz., the theorem, <hi rend="italic">The three interior angles
                    of every triangle are together equal to two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>As easy deductions not given by Euclid but added by Simson follow the
                    propositions about the angles in polygons, they are given in English editions as
                    corollaries to Prop. 32.</p>
                <p>These theorems do not hold for spherical figures. The sum of the interior angles
                    of a spherical triangle is always greater than two right angles, and increases
                    with the area.</p>

                <p>§ 16. The theory of parallels as such may be said to be finished with Props. 33
                    and 34, which state properties of the parallelogram, i.e., of a quadrilateral

                <p>Prop. 34. <hi rend="italic">The opposite sides and angles of a parallelogram are
                    equal to one another, and the diameter {diagonal) bisects the parallelogram,
                    that is, divides it into two equal parts.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 17. The rest of the first book relates to areas of figures.</p>
                <p>The theory is made to depend upon the theorems—</p>
                <p>Prop. 35. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms on the same base and between the same
                    parallels are equal to one another</hi>; and</p>
                <p>Prop. 36. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms on equal bases, and between the same
                    parallels, are equal to. one another.</hi></p>
                <p>As each parallelogram is bisected by a diagonal, the last theorems hold also if
                    the -word parallelogram be replaced by “triangle,” as is done in Props. 37 and
                    38.</p>
                <p>It is to be remarked that Euclid proves these propositions only in the case when
                    the parallelograms or triangles have their bases in the same straight line.</p>
                <p>The theorems converse to the last form the contents of the next three
                    propositions, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Props. 40 and 41).— <hi rend="italic">Equal
                    triangles, on the same or on equal bases, in the same straight line, and on the
                    same side of it, are between the same parallels.</hi></p>
                <p>That the two cases here stated are given by Euclid in two separate propositions
                    proved separately is characteristic of his method.</p>
                <p>§ 18. To compare areas of other figures, Euclid shows first, in Prop. 42, how <hi
                    rend="italic">to draw a parallelogram which is equal in area to a given
                    triangle, and has one of its angles equal to a given angle.</hi> If the given
                    angle is right, then the problem is solved <hi rend="italic">to draw a
                    “rectangle” equal in area to a given triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>Next this parallelogram is transformed into another parallelogram, <hi
                    rend="italic">which has one of its sides equal to a given straight line,</hi>
                    whilst its angles remain unaltered. This may be done by aid of the theorem
                    in</p>
                <p>Prop. 43. <hi rend="italic">The complements of the parallelograms which are about
                    the diameter of any parallelogram are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the problem (Prop. 44) is solved <hi rend="italic">to construct a
                    parallelogram on a given line, which is equal in area to a given triangle, and
                    which has one angle equal to a given angle</hi> (generally a right angle).</p>
                <p>As every polygon can be divided into a number of triangles, we can now construct
                    a parallelogram having a given angle, say a right angle, and being equal in area
                    to a given polygon. For each of the triangles into which the polygon has been
                    divided, a parallelogram may be constructed, having one side equal to a given
                    straight line, and one angle equal to a given angle. If these parallelograms be
                    placed side by side, they may be added together to form a single parallelogram,
                    having still one side of the given length. This is done in Prop. 45.</p>
                <p>Herewith a means is found to compare areas of different polygons. We need only
                    construct two rectangles equal in area to the given polygons, and having each
                    one side of given length. By comparing the unequal sides we are enabled to judge
                    whether the areas are equal, or which is the greater. Euclid does not state this
                    consequence, but the problem is taken up again at the end of the second book,
                    where it is shown how to construct a square equal in area to a given
                    polygon.</p>
                <p>§ 19. The first book concludes with one of the most important theorems in the
                    whole of geometry, and one which has been celebrated since the earliest times.
                    It is stated, but on doubtful authority, that Pythagoras discovered it, and it
                    has been called by his name. If we call that side in a right-angled triangle
                    λvhich is opposite the right angle the hypotenuse, we may state it as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem of Pythagoras</hi> (Prop. 47).— <hi rend="italic">In
                    every right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of
                    the squares of the other sides.</hi></p>
                <p>And conversely—</p>
                <p>Prop. 48. <hi rend="italic">If the square described on one of the sides of a
                    triangle be equal to the squares described on the other sides, then the angle
                    contained by these two sides is a right angle.</hi></p>
                <p>On this theorem (Prop. 47) almost all geometrical measurement depends, which
                    cannot be directly obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> II.</p>
                <p>§ 20. The propositions in the second book are very different in character from
                    those in the first; they all relate to areas of rectangles and squares. Their
                    true significance is best seen by stating them in an algebraic form. This is
                    often done by expressing the lengths of lines by aid of numbers, which tell how
                    many times a chosen unit is contained in the lines. If there is a unit to be
                    found which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> contained an exact number of times in each
                    side of a rectangle, it is easily seen, and generally shown in the teaching of
                    arithmetic, that the rectangle contains a number of unit squares equal to the
                    product of the numbers which measure the sides, a unit square being the square
                    on the unit line. If, however, no such unit can be found, this process requires
                    that connexion between lines and numbers which is only established by aid of
                    ratios of lines, and which is therefore at this stage altogether inadmissible.
                    But there exists another way of connecting these propositions with algebra,
                    based on modem notions which seem destined greatly to change and to simplify
                    mathematics. We shall introduce here as much of it as is required for our
                    present purpose.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the second book we find a definition according to which “a
                    rectangle is said tobe ‘ contained* by the two sides which contain one of its
                    right angles”; in the text this phraseology is extended by speaking of
                    rectangles contained by any two straight lines, meaning the rectangle which has
                    two adjacent sides equal to the two straight lines.</p>
                <p>We shall denote a finite straight line by a single small letter, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">. . . .</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> and the area of the rectangle contained by two lines <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> by <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and this we
                    shall call the product of the two lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> It will be understood that this definition has nothing to
                    do with the definition of a product of numbers.</p>
                <p>We define as follows :—</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sum</hi> of two straight lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> means a straight line <hi rend="italic">c</hi> which
                    may be divided in two parts equal respectively to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This sum is denoted by <hi rend="italic">a-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">rb.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">difference of two</hi> lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (in symbols, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>- δ) means a line
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> which when added to <hi rend="italic">b</hi> gives <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>; that is,</p>
                <p>α- <hi rend="italic">b=c</hi> if <hi rend="italic">b+c≈a.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">product</hi> of two lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> (in symbols, <hi rend="italic">ab)</hi> means the area of
                    the rectangle contained by the lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> For <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> which means the square on
                    the line <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we write α <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>.</p>
                <p>§ 21. The first ten of the fourteen propositions of the second book may then be
                    written in the form of formulae as follows :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen that 5 and 6, and also 9 and 10, are identical. In Euclid’s
                    statement they do not look the same, the figures being arranged differently.</p>

                    numbers', it follows from algebra that each of these formulae is true. But this
                    does not prove them in our case, where the letters denote lines, and their
                    products areas without any reference to numbers. To prove them we have to
                    discover the laws which rule the operations introduced, viz., addition and
                    multiplication of segments. This we shall do now; and we shall find that these
                    laws are the same with those which hold in algebraical addition and
                    multiplication.</p>
                <p>§ 22. In a sum of numbers we may change the order in which the numbers are added,
                    and we may also add the numbers together in groups, and then add these groups.
                    But this also holds for the sum of segments and for the sum of rectangles, as a
                    little consideration shows. That the sum of rectangles has always a meaning
                    follows from the Props. 43-45 in the first book. These laws about addition are
                    reducible to the two—</p>

                    deduced from the above.</p>
                <p>For the product of two numbers we have the law that it remains unaltered if the
                    factors be interchanged. This also holds for our geometrical product. For if <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> denotes the area of the rectangle which has <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> as base and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as altitude, then <hi

                    rend="italic">b</hi> as base and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as altitude. But in a
                    rectangle we may take either of the two lines which contain it as base, and then
                    the other will be the altitude. This gives</p>

                <p>In order further to multiply a sum by a number, we have in algebra the
                    rule:—Multiply each term of the sum, and add the products thus obtained. That
                    this holds for our geometrical products is shown by Euclid in his first
                    proposition of the second book, where he proves that the area of a rectangle
                    whose base is the sum of a number of segments is equal to the sum of rectangles

                <p>To these laws which have been investigated by Sir William Hamilton and by Hermann
                    Grassmann, the former has given special names. He calls the laws expressed
                    in</p>
                <p>(1) and (3) the commutative law for addition;</p>
                <p>(5) „ ,, multiplication;</p>
                <p>(2) and (4) the associative laws for addition;</p>
                <p>(6) the distributive law.</p>
                <p>§ 23. Having proved that these six laws hold, we can at once prove every one of
                    the above propositions in their algebraical form.</p>
                <p>The first is proved geometrically, it being one of the fundamental laws. The next
                    two propositions are only special cases of the first. Of the others we shall
                    prove one, viz., the fourth:— (α÷δ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = (α + δ) (α

                <p>This gives the theorem in question.</p>
                <p>In the same manner every one of the first ten propositions is proved.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the operations performed are exactly the same as if the
                    letters denoted numbers.</p>
                <p>Props. 5 and 6 may also be written thus—</p>

                <p>Prop. 7, which is an easy consequence of Prop. 4, may be transformed. If we
                    denote by <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the line <hi rend="italic">a + b,</hi> so
                    that <hi rend="italic">c=a + b,</hi><hi rend="italic">a≈c-b,</hi> we get c <hi

                <p>Subtracting c <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> from both sides, and writing <hi

                <p>Tn Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> this form of the theorem does not
                    appear, all propositions being so stated that the notion of subtraction does not
                    enter into them.</p>
                <p>§ 24. The remaining two theorems (Props. 12 and 13) connect the square on one
                    side of a triangle with the sum of the squares on the other sides, in case that
                    the angle between the latter is acute or obtuse. They are important theorems in
                    trigonometry, where it is possible to include them in a single theorem.</p>
                <p>§ 25. There are in the second-book two problems, Props. 11 and 14.</p>
                <p>If written in the above symbolic language, the former requires to find a line <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> such that <hi rend="italic">a(ax)-x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> Prop. 11 contains, therefore, the
                    solution of a quadratic equation, which we may write <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+ ax =</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> The
                    solution is required later on in the construction of a regular decagon.</p>
                <p>More important is the problem in the last proposition (Prop. 14). It requires the
                    construction of a square equal in area to a given rectangle, hence a solution of
                    the equation x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi></p>
                <p>In Book I., 42-45, it has been shown how a rectangle may be constructed equal in
                    area to a given figure bounded by straight lines. By aid of the new proposition
                    we may therefore now determine a line such that the square on that line is equal
                    in area to any given rectilinear figure, or we can <hi rend="italic">square</hi>
                    any such figure.</p>
                <p>As of two squares that is the greater which has the greater side, it follows that
                    now the comparison of two areas has been reduced to the comparison of two
                    lines.</p>
                <p>The problem of reducing other areas to squares is frequently met with among Greek
                    mathematicians. We need only mention the problem of squaring the circle.</p>
                <p>In the present day the comparison of areas is performed in a simpler way by
                    reducing all areas to rectangles having a common base. Their altitudes give then
                    a measure of their areas.</p>
                <p>The construction of a rectangle having the base <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> and
                    being equal in area to a given rectangle, depends upon Prop. 43, L This
                    therefore gives a solution of the equation <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">ux,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    denotes the unknown altitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> III.</p>
                <p>§ 26. The third book of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> relates exclusively
                    to properties of the circle. A circle and its circumference have been defined in
                    Book I., Def. 15. We restate it here in slightly different words :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> The circumference of a circle is a plane
                    curve such that all points in it have the same distance from a fixed point in
                    the plane. This point is called the “centre” of the circle.</p>
                <p>Of the new definitions, of which eleven are given at the beginning of the third
                    book, a few only require special mention. The first, which says that circles
                    with equal radii are equal, is in part a theorem, but easily proved by applying
                    the one circle to the other. Or it may be considered proved by aid of Prop. 24,
                    equal circles not being used till after this theorem.</p>
                <p>In the second definition is explained what is meant by a line which “touches” a
                    circle. Such a line is now generally called a tangent to the circle. The
                    introduction of this name allows us to state many of Euclid’s propositions in a
                    much shorter form.</p>
                <p>For the same reason we shall call a straight line joining two points on the
                    circumference of a circle a “chord.”</p>
                <p>Definitions 4 and 5 may be replaced with a slight generalization by the following
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> By the distance of a point from a line is
                    meant the length of the perpendicular drawn from the point to the line.</p>
                <p>§ 27. From the definition of a circle it follows that every circle has a centre.
                    Prop. 1 requires to find it when the circle is given, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> when its circumference is drawn.</p>
                <p>To solve this problem a chord is drawn (that is, any two points in the
                    circumference are joined), and through the point where this is bisected a
                    perpendicular to it is erected. Euclid then proves, first, that no point off
                    this perpendicular can be the centre, hence that the centre must lie in this
                    line; and, secondly, that of the points on the perpendicular one only can be the
                    centre, viz., the one which bisects the part of the perpendicular bounded by the
                    circle. In the second part Euclid silently assumes that the perpendicular there
                    used does cut the circumference in two, and only in two points. The proof
                    therefore is incomplete. The proof of the first part, however, is exact. By
                    drawing two non-parallel chords, and the perpendiculars which bisect them, the
                    centre will be found as the point where these perpendiculars intersect.</p>
                <p>§ 28. In Prop. 2 it is proved that a chord of a circle lies altogether within the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>What we have called the first part of Euclid’s solution of Prop. 1 may be stated
                    as a theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Every straight line which
                    bisects a chord, and is at right angles to it, passes through the centre of the
                    circle.</hi></p>
                <p>The converse to this gives Prop. 3, which may be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If a straight line through the centre of a circle bisect a
                    chord, then it is perpendicular to the chord, and if it be perpendicular to the
                    chord it bisects it.</hi></p>
                <p>An easy consequence of this is the following theorem, which is essentially the
                    same as Prop. 4 :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 4).— <hi rend="italic">Two chords of a
                    circle, of which neither passes through the centre, cannot bisect each
                    other.</hi></p>
                <p>These last three theorems are fundamental for the theory of the circle. It is to
                    be remarked that Euclid never proves that a straight line cannot have more than
                    two points in common with a circumference.</p>
                <p>§ 29. The next two propositions (5 and 6) might be replaced by a single and a
                    simpler theorem, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Two circles which have a
                    common centre, and whose circumferences have one point in common,
                    coincide.</hi></p>
                <p>Or, more in agreement with Euclid’s form:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Two different circles, whose
                    circumferences have a point in common, cannot have the same centre.</hi></p>
                <p>That Euclid treats of two cases is characteristic of Greek mathematics.</p>
                <p>The next two propositions (7 and 8) again belong together. They may be combined
                    thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If from a point in a plane
                    of a circle, which is not the centre, straight lines be drawn to the different
                    points of the circumference, then of all these lines one is the shortest, and
                    one the longest, and these lie both in that straight line which joins the given
                    point to the centre. Of all the remaining lines each is equal to one and only
                    one other, and these equal lines lie on opposite sides of the shortest or
                    longest, and make equal angles with them.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid distinguishes the two cases where the given point lies within or without
                    the circle, omitting the case where it lies in the circumference.</p>
                <p>From the last proposition it follows that if from a point more than two equal
                    straight lines can be drawn to the circumference, this point must be the centre.
                    This is Prop. 9.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of this we get <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">If the circumferences of the two circles have three points in
                    common they coincide.</hi></p>
                <p>For in this case the two circles have a common centre, because from the centre of
                    the one three equal lines can be drawn to points on the circumference of the
                    other. But two circles which have a common centre, and whose circumferences have
                    a point in common, coincide. (Compare above statement of Props. 5 and 6. ) <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0394-0381"/> This theorem may also be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Through three points only one circumference may be drawn</hi>;
                    or, <hi rend="italic">Three points determine a circle.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid does not give the theorem in this form. He proves, however, <hi
                    rend="italic">that the two circles cannot cut another in more than</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tιvo</hi><hi rend="italic">points</hi> (Prop. 10), and <hi
                    rend="italic">that two circles cannot touch one another in more points than
                    one</hi> (Prop. 13).</p>
                <p>§ 30. Propositions 11 and 12 assert that <hi rend="italic">if two circles touch,
                    then the point of contact lies on the line joining their centres.</hi> This
                    gives two propositions, because the circles may touch either internally or
                    externally.</p>
                <p>§ 31. Propositions 14 and 15 relate to the length of chords. The first says; <hi
                    rend="italic">that equal chords are equidistant from the centre,and that chords
                    which are equidistant from the centre are equal;</hi></p>
                <p>Whilst Prop. 15 compares unequal chords, viz., <hi rend="italic">Of all chords
                    the diameter is the greatest, and of other chords that is the greater which is
                    nearer to the centre</hi>; and conversely, <hi rend="italic">the greater chord
                    is nearer to the centre.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 32. In Prop. 16 the tangent to a circle is for the first time introduced. The
                    proposition is meant to show that the straight line at the end point of the
                    diameter, and at right angles to it is a tangent. The proposition itself does
                    not state this. It runs thus :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. <hi rend="italic">The straight line drawn at right angles to the
                    diameter of a circle, from the extremity of it, falls without the circle; and no
                    straight line can be drawn from the extremity, between that straight line and
                    the circumference, so as not to cut the circle.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Corollary.—</hi> The straight line at right angles to a diameter drawn through
                    the end point of it touches the circle.</p>
                <p>The statement of the proposition and its whole treatment show the difficulties
                    which the tangents presented to Euclid.</p>
                <p>Prop. 17 solves the problem <hi rend="italic">through a given point, cither in
                    the circumference or without it, to draw a tangent to a given circle.</hi></p>
                <p>Closely connected with Prop. 16 are Props. 18 and 19, which state (Prop. 18), <hi
                    rend="italic">that the line joining the centre of a circle to the point of
                    contact of a tangent is perpendicular to the tangent</hi>; and conversely (Prop.
                    19), <hi rend="italic">that the straight line through the point of contact of,
                    and perpendicular to, a tangent to a circle passes through the centre of the
                    circle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 33. The rest of the book relates to angles connected with a circle, viz.,
                    angles which have the vertex either at the centre or on the circumference, and
                    which are called respectively angles at the centre and angles at the
                    circumference. Between these two kinds of angles exists the important relation
                    expressed as follows :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">The angle at the centre of a circle is double of the
                    angle at the circumference on the same base, that is, on the same arc.</hi></p>
                <p>This is of great importance for its consequences, of which the two following are
                    the principal :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">The angles in. the same segment of a circle are equal
                    to one another·,</hi></p>
                <p>And Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">The opposite angles of any quadrilateral figure
                    inscribed in a circle are together equal to two right angles.</hi></p>
                <p>Further consequences are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 23. <hi rend="italic">On the same straight line, and on the same side oj
                    it, there cannot be two similar segments of circles, not coinciding with me
                    another;</hi></p>
                <p>And Prop. 24. <hi rend="italic">Similar segments of circles on equal straight
                    lines are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>The problem Prop. 25, <hi rend="italic">A segment of a circle being given to
                    describe the circle of which it is a segment,</hi> may be solved much more
                    easily by aid of the construction described in relation to Prop. 1, III., in
                    §27.</p>
                <p>§ 34. There follow four theorems connecting the angles at the centre, the arcs
                    into which they divide the circumference, and the chords subtending these arcs.
                    They are expressed for angles, arcs, and chords in equal circles, but they hold
                    also for angles, arcs, and chords in the same circle.</p>
                <p>The theorems are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 26. <hi rend="italic">In equal circles equal angles stand on equal arcs,
                    whether they be at the centres or circumferences;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 27 (converse to Prop. 26). <hi rend="italic">In equal circles the angles
                    which stand on equal arcs are equal to one another, whether they be at the
                    centres or the circumferences·,</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 28. <hi rend="italic">In equal circles equal straight lines</hi> (equal
                    chords) <hi rend="italic">cut off equal arcs, the greater equal to the greater,
                    and the less equal to the less;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 29 (converse to Prop. 28). <hi rend="italic">In equal circles equal arcs
                    are subtended by equal straight lines.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 35. Other important consequences of Props. 20-22 are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 31. <hi rend="italic">In a circle the angle in a semicircle is a right
                    angle; but the angle in a segment greater than a semicircle is less than a right
                    amgle; and the angle in a segment less than a semicircle is greater than a right
                    angle;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 32. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line touch a circle, and from the point
                    of contact a straight line be drawn cutting the circle, the angles which
                    this</hi><hi rend="italic">Une</hi><hi rend="italic">makes wiih the line
                    touching the circle shall be equal to the angles which are in the alternate
                    segments of the circle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 36. Propositions 30, 33, 34, contain problems which are solved by aid of the
                    propositions preceding them :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 30. <hi rend="italic">To bisect a given arc, that is, to divide it into two
                    equal parts;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 33. <hi rend="italic">On a given straight line to describe a segment of a
                    circle containing an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 34. <hi rend="italic">From a given circle to cut off a segment containing
                    an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 37. If we draw chords through a point A within a circle, they will each be
                    divided by A into two segments. Between these segments the law holds that the
                    rectangle contained by them has the same area on whatever chord through A the
                    segments are taken. The value of this rectangle changes, of course, with the
                    position of A.</p>
                <p>A similar theorem holds if the point A be taken without the circle. On every
                    straight line through A, which cuts the circle in two points B and C, we have
                    two segments AB and AC, and the rectangles contained by them are again equal to
                    one another, and equal to the square on a tangent drawn from A to the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>The first of these theorems gives Prop. 35, and the second Prop. 36, with its
                    corollary, whilst Prop. 37, the last of Book III., gives the converse to Prop.
                    36.' The first two theorems may be combined in one :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If through a point A inthe
                    plane of acircle astraight line be drawn cutting the circle in B and C, then the
                    rectangle ABAC has a constant value so long as the point A be fixed; and if from
                    A a tangent AD can be drawn to the circle, touching at D, then the above
                    rectangle equals the square bn AD.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 37 may be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If from a point A without a
                    circle a line be drawn cutting the circle in B and C, and another line to a
                    point D on the circle, and if</hi><hi rend="italic">AB.AC=AD</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">then
                    the line AD touches the circle at D.</hi></p>
                <p>It is not difficult to prove also the converse to the general proposition as
                    above stated. It may be expressed as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iffour points ABCD be taken on the circumference of a circle,
                    and if the lines AB, CD, produced if necessary, meet at E, then</hi></p>
                <p>EA . EB = EC . ED; <hi rend="italic">and conversely, if this relation holds then
                    the four points lie on a circle, that is, the circle drawn through three of them
                    passes through the fourth.</hi></p>
                <p>That a circle may always be drawn through three points, provided that they do not
                    lie in a straight line, is proved only later on in Book IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> IV.</p>
                <p>§ 38. The fourth book contains only problems, all relating to the construction of
                    triangles and polygons inscribed in and circumscribed about circles, and of
                    circles inscribed in or circumscribed about triangles and polygons. They are
                    nearly all given for their own sake, and not for future use in the construction
                    of figures, as are most of those in the former books. In seven definitions at
                    the beginning of the book it is explained what is understood by figures
                    inscribed in or described about other figures, with special reference to the
                    case where one figure is a circle. Instead, however, of saying that one figure
                    is described about another, it is now generally said that the one figure is
                    circumscribed about the other. We may then state the definitions 3 or 4 thus
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> A polygon is said to be inscribed in a
                    circle, and the circle is said to be circumscribed about the polygon, if the
                    vertices of the polygon lie in the circumference of the circle.</p>
                <p>And definitions 5 and 6 thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> A polygon is said to be circumscribed about a
                    circle, and a circle is said to be inscribed in a polygon, if the sides of the
                    polygon are tangents to the circle.</p>
                <p>§ 39. The first problem is merely constructive. It requires to draw in a given
                    circle a chord equal to a given straight line, which is not greater than the
                    diameter of the circle. The problem is not a determinate one, inasmuch as the
                    chord may be drawn from any point in the circumference. This may be said of
                    almost all problems in this book, especially of the next two. They are :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 2. <hi rend="italic">In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular
                    to a given triangle;</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 3. <hi rend="italic">About a given circle to circumscribe a triangle
                    equiangular to a given triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 40. Of somewhat greater interest are the next problems, where the triangles are
                    given and the circles to be found.</p>
                <p>Prop. 4. <hi rend="italic">To inscribe a circle in a given triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>The result is that the problem has always a solution, viz., the centre of the
                    circle is the point where the bisectors of two of the nterior angles of the
                    triangle meet. The solution shows, though Euclid does not state this, that the
                    problem has but one solution; and also, <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">The three bisectors of the interior angles of any triangle</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"

                    centre of the circle inscribed in the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>The solutions of most of the other problems contain also theorems. Of these we
                    shall state those which are of special interest; Euclid does not state any one
                    of them.</p>
                <p>§ 41. Prop. 5. <hi rend="italic">To circumscribe a circle about a given
                    triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>The one solution which always exists contains the following :— <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The three straight lines which
                    bisect the sides of a triangle at right angles meet in a point, and this point
                    is the centre of the circle circu mscribed about the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>Euelid adds in a corollary the following property :—</p>
                <p>The centre, of the circle circumscribed about a triangle lies within, on a side
                    of, or without the triangle, according as the triangle is acute-angled,
                    right-angled, or obtuse-angled.</p>
                <p>§ 42. Whilst it is always possible to draw a circle which is inscribed in or
                    circumscribed about a given triangle, this is not the case with quadrilaterals
                    or polygons of more sides. Of those for which this is possible the regular
                    polygons are the most interesting. In each of them a circle may be inscribed,
                    and another may be circumscribed about it.</p>
                <p>Euclid does not use the word regular, but he describes the polygons in question
                    as <hi rend="italic">equiangular</hi> and <hi rend="italic">equilateral.</hi> We
                    shall use the name regular polygon. The regular triangle is equilateral, the
                    regular quadrilateral is the square.</p>
                <p>Euclid considers the regular polygons of 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides. For each of the
                    first three he solves the problems—(1) to inscribe such a polygon in a given
                    circle; (2) to circumscribe it about a given circle; (3) to inscribe a circle
                    in, and (4) to circumscribe a circle about, such a polygon.</p>
                <p>For the regular triangle the problems are not repeated, because more general
                    problems have been solved.</p>
                <p>Props. 6, 7, 8, and 9 solve these problems for the square.</p>
                <p>The general problem of inscribing in a given circle a regular polygon of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> sides depends upon the problem of dividing the
                    circumference of a circle into <hi rend="italic">n</hi> equal parts, or what
                    comes to the same thing, of drawing from the centre of the circle <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> radii such that the angles between consecutive radii are
                    equal, that is, to divide the space about the centre into <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> equal angles. Thus, if it is required to inscribe a square in a circle,
                    we have to draw four lines from the centre, making the four angles equal. This
                    is done by drawing two diameters at right angles to one another. The ends of
                    these diameters are the vertices of the required square. If, on the other hand,
                    tangents be drawn at these ends, we obtain a square circumscribed about the
                    circle.</p>
                <p>§ 43. To construct <hi rend="italic">a. regular pentagon,</hi> we find it
                    convenient first to construct a <hi rend="italic">regular decagon.</hi> This
                    requires to divide the space about the centre into ten equal angles. Each will
                    be <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of a right angle, or ⅜th of two right
                    angles. If we suppose the decagon constructed, and if we join the centre to the
                    end of one side, we get an isoceles triangle, where the angle at the centre
                    equals ⅜th of two right angles; hence each of the angles at the base will be
                    ⅜ths of two right angles, as all three angles together equal two right angles.
                    Thus we have to construct an isoceles triangle, having the angle at the vertex
                    equal to half an angle at the base. This is solved in Prop. 10, by aid of the
                    problem in Prop. 11 of the second book. If we make the sides of this triangle
                    equal to the radius of the given circle, then the base will be the side of the
                    regular decagon inscribed in the circle. This side being known the decagon can
                    be constructed, and if the vertices are joined alternately, leaving out half
                    their number, we obtain the regular pentagon.</p>
                <p>Euclid does not proceed thus. He wants the pentagon before the decagon. This,
                    however, does not change the real nature of his solution, nor does his solution
                    become simpler by not mentioning the decagon.</p>
                <p>Once the regular pentagon is inscribed, it is easy to circumscribe another by
                    drawing tangents at the vertices of the inscribed pentagon. This is shown in
                    Prop. 12.</p>
                <p>Prop. 13 and 14 teach how a circle may be inscribed in or circumscribed about any
                    given regular pentagon.</p>
                <p>§ 44. The <hi rend="italic">regular hexagon</hi> is more easily constructed, as
                    shown in Prop. 15. The result is that the side of the regular hexagon inscribed
                    in a circle is equal to the radius of the circle.</p>
                <p>For this polygon the other three problems mentioned are not solved.</p>
                <p>§ 45. The book closes with Prop. 16. To inscribe a regular quindecagon in a given
                    circle. That this may be done is easily seen. If we inscribe a regular pentagon
                    and a regular hexagon in the circle, having one vertex in common, then the arc
                    from the common vertex to the next vertex of the pentagon is ’ th of the
                    circumference, and to the next vertex of the hexagon is ⅜th of the
                    circumference. The difference between these arcs is, therefore, ⅜. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> ½=^⅛th °f the circumference. The latter may,
                    therefore, be divided into thirty, and hence also in fifteen equal parts, and
                    the regular quindecagon be described.</p>
                <p>§ 46. We conclude with a few theorems about regular polygons which are not given
                    by Euclid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The straight lines</hi><hi

                    is the centre of the circles circumscribed about and inscribed in the regular
                    polygon.</hi> The proof, which is easy, is left to the reader.</p>
                <p>We can bisect any given arc (Prop. 30, III.). Hence we can divide a circumference

                    equal parts, or as soon as a regular polygon of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> sides

                <p>The construction of any new régulai· polygon not included in one of these series
                    will give rise to a new series. Till the beginning of this century nothing was
                    added to the knowledge of regular polygons as given by Euclid. Then Gauss, in
                    his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic,</hi> proved that every regular
                    polgon of 2 <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> +1 sides may be constructed if this
                    number 2»&gt; +1 be prime, and that no others can be constructed by elementary
                    methods. This shows that regular polygons of 7, 9, 13 sides cannot thus be
                    constructed, but that a regular polygon of 17 sides is possible; for 17≈2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> + 1. The next polygon is one of 257 sides. The
                    construction becomes already rather complicated for 17 sides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> V.</p>
                <p>§ 47. The fifth book of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is not exclusively
                    geometrical. It contains the theory of ratios and proportion of quantities in
                    general. The treatment, as here given, is admirable, and in every respect
                    superior to the algebraical method by which Euclid’s theory is now generally
                    replaced. It has, however, the reputation of being too difficult for schools,
                    and is therefore very seldom read. We shall try to make the subject clear, and
                    to show why the usual algebraical treatment of proportion is not really sound.
                    We begin by quoting those definitions at the beginning of Book V. which are most
                    important. These definitions have given rise to much discussion.</p>
                <p>Tlιe only definitions which are essential for the fifth book are Defs. 1, 2, 4,
                    5, 6, and 7. Of the remainder 3, 8, and 9 are more than useless, and probably
                    not Euclid’s, but additions of later editors, of whom Theon of Alexandria was
                    the most prominent. Defs. 10 and 11 belong rather to the sixth book, whilst all
                    the others are merely nominal. The really important ones are 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>
                <p>§ 48. To define a magnitude is not attempted by Euclid. The first two definitions
                    state what is meant by a “part,” that is, a submultiple or measure, and by a
                    “multiple” of a given magnitude. The meaning of Def. 4 is that two given
                    quantities can have a ratio to one another only in case that they are comparable
                    as to their magnitude, that is, if they are of the same kind.</p>
                <p>Def. 3, which is probably due to Theon, professes to define a ratio, but is as
                    meaningless as it is uncalled for, for all that is wanted is given in Defs. 5
                    and 7.</p>
                <p>In Def. 5 it is explained what is meant by saying that two magnitudes have the
                    same ratio to one another as two other magnitudes, and in Def. 7 what we have to
                    understand by a greater or a less ratio. The 6th definition is only nominal,
                    explaining the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">proportional.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid represents magnitudes by lines, and often denotes them either by single
                    letters or, like lines, by two letters. We shall use only single letters for the
                    purpose. If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> denote two
                    magnitudes of the same kind, their ratio will be denoted by <hi rend="italic">a:
                    b</hi>; if <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are two other
                    magnitudes of the same kind, but possibly of a different kind from <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then if <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> have the same ratio to one another as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> this will be expressed by
                    writing— <hi rend="italic">a: b:: c: d.</hi></p>
                <p>Further, if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is a (whole) number, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ma</hi> shall denote the multiple of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> which is obtained
                    by taking it <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times.</p>
                <p>§ 49. The whole theory of ratios is based on Def. 5.</p>
                <p>Def. 5. <hi rend="italic">The first of four magnitudes is said to have the same
                    ratio to the second that the third has to the fourth when, any equimultiples

                    of the second and the fourth, if the multiple of the first be less than that of
                    the second, the multiple of the third is also less than that of the fourth; and
                    if the multiple of the first is equal to that of the second, the multiple of the
                    third is also equal to that of the fourth √ and if the multiple of the first is
                    greater than that of the second, the multiple of the third is also greater than
                    that of the fourth.</hi></p>

                <p>That this is true is in oui’ case easily seen. We may suppose that the triangles
                    have a common vertex, and their bases in the same line. "We set off the base <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> along the line containing the bases <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> times; we then join the different parts of division to the vertex, and
                    get <hi rend="italic">m</hi> triangles all equal to <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>
                    The triangle on <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> as base equals, therefore, <hi
                    rend="italic">ma.</hi> If we proceed in the same manner with the base <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> setting it off <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times, we find
                    that the area of the triangle on the base <hi rend="italic">nb</hi> equals <hi
                    rend="italic">nβ,</hi> the vertex of all triangles being the same. But if two
                    triangles have the same altitude, then their areas are equal if the bases are
                    equal; hence <hi rend="italic">ma≈nβ</hi> if <hi rend="italic">ma=nb,</hi> and
                    if their bases are unequal, then that has the greater area which is on the
                    greater base; in other words, <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> is greater than, equal
                    to, or less than <hi rend="italic">nβ,</hi> according as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ma</hi> is greater than, equal to, or less than <hi rend="italic">nb,</hi>
                    which was to be proved.</p>
                <p>§ 50. It will be seen that even in this example it does not become evident what a
                    ratio really is. It is still an open question whether ratios are magnitudes
                    which we can compare. We do not know whether the ratio of two lines is a
                    magnitude of the same kind as the ratio of two areas. Though we might say that
                    Def. 5 defines <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> ratios, still we do not know whether
                    they are equal in the sense of the axiom, that two things which are equal to a
                    third are equal to one another. That this is the case requires a proof, and
                    until this proof is given we shall use the :: instead of the sign =, which,
                    however, we shall afterwards introduce.</p>
                <p>As soon as it has been established that all ratios are like magnitudes, it
                    becomes easy to show that, in some cases at least, they are numbers. This step
                    was never made by Greek mathematicians. They distinguished always most carefully
                    between continuous magnitudes and the discrete series of numbers. In modern
                    times it has become the custom to ignore this difference.</p>
                <p>If, in determining the ratio of two lines, a common measure can be found, which
                    is contained <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times in the first, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> times in the second, then the ratio of the two lines equals the ratio of
                    the two numbers <hi rend="italic">m: n.</hi> This is shown by Euclid in Prop. 5,
                    X. But the ratio of two numbers is, as a rule, a fraction, and the Greeks did
                    not, as we do, consider fractions as numbers. Far less had they any notion of
                    introducing irrational numbers, which are neither whole nor fractional, as we
                    are obliged to do if we wish to say that all ratios are numbers. The
                    incommensurable numbers which are thus introduced as ratios of incommensurable
                    quantities are nowadays as familiar to us as fractions; but a proof is generally
                    omitted that we may apply to them the rules which have been established for
                    rational numbers only. Euclid’s treatment of ratios avoids this difficulty. His
                    definitions holds for commensurable as well as for incommensurable quantities.
                    Even the notion of incommensurable quantities is avoided in Book V. But he
                    proves that the more elementary rules of algebra hold for ratios. We shall state
                    all his propositions in that algebraical form to which we are now accustomed.
                    This may, of course, be done without changing the character of Euclid’s
                    method.</p>
                <p>§ 51. Using the notation explained above we express the first propositions as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 1. If <hi rend="italic">a-ma</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">, b≈mb', c=md,</hi>
                    then <hi rend="italic">a + b + c = m(a' + b</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">+
                    d).</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 2. If <hi rend="italic">a = mb,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c≈mã,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e=nb,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f≈nd,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> is the same multiple of
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as c +∕ is of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> viz. :— α +
                    e=(γn + n)δ, and c+∕=(wι+n)tZ.</p>
                <p>Prop. 3. If α = mδ, <hi rend="italic">c≈md,</hi> then is <hi rend="italic"
                    >na</hi> the same multiple of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> that <hi rend="italic"
                    >nc</hi> is of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> viz., <hi rend="italic">na≈nmb,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nc=nmd.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 4. If <hi rend="italic">a: b:: c: d,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">ma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∙.rib</hi><hi rend="italic">:: me: nd.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 5. If α = mδ, <hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic">c = md</hi> then
                    <hi rend="italic">a-c≈m(b-d).</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 6. If <hi rend="italic">a≈mb,c=md,</hi> then are <hi rend="italic">a -
                    nb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c - nd</hi> either equal to, or equimultiples of,
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >a-rib=(m-</hi><hi rend="italic">riſb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nd≈(m-n)d,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">m-n</hi> may be unity.</p>
                <p>All these propositions relate to <hi rend="italic">equimultiples.</hi> Now follow
                    propositions about ratios which are compared as to their magnitude.</p>
                <p>§ 52. Prop. 7. If α = δ, then <hi rend="italic">a: c:: b: c</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c: a:: c: b.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof is simply this. As α = δ we know that <hi rend="italic">ma≈mb;</hi>
                    therefore if <hi rend="italic">ma&gt;nc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                    >mb&gt;nc,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">ma - nc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                    >mb</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">nc,</hi> if <hi rend="italic"
                    >ma&lt;fnc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">mb&lt;fnc,</hi> therefore the first
                    proportion holds by Definition 5.</p>
                <p>Prop. 8. If <hi rend="italic">dfi&gt;b,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cfi&gt;b ∙.c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c:aQc.b.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof depends on Definition 7.</p>
                <p>Prop. 9 (converse to Prop. 7). If</p>
                <p>&lt;z: c:: δ: c, or if <hi rend="italic">c: a:: c</hi>: δ, then α=≈δ.</p>
                <p>Prop. 10 (converse to Prop. 8). If <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cfi&gt;b</hi><hi rend="italic">: c,</hi> then α&gt;δ and if <hi rend="italic"
                    >c:</hi><hi rend="italic">a&lt;fc</hi>: δ, then <hi rend="italic"
                    >a&lt;fi,</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 11. If <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ:: <hi rend="italic">c: d,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>: δ:: e then c: <hi rend="italic">d:: e :fi</hi></p>
                <p>In words, <hi rend="italic">if two ratios are equal to a third, they are equal to
                    one</hi><hi rend="italic">another.</hi> After these propositions have been
                    proved, we have a right to consider a ratio as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >magnitude,</hi> for only now can we consider a ratio as something for which the
                    axiom about magnitudes holds: things which are equal to a third are equal to one
                    another.</p>
                <p>We shall indicate this by writing in future the sign = instead of:: . The
                    remaining propositions, which explain themselves, may then be stated as
                    follows:—</p>
                <p>§53. Prop. 12. If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d≈e :fi</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                    >a+c+e</hi><hi rend="italic">∙.b+d+f≈a</hi><hi rend="italic">:b.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 13. If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>:
                    &lt;ζ&gt;c: <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ≥c <hi
                    rend="italic">∙.f.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 14. If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d,</hi> and α&gt;c, then <hi rend="italic"
                    >b~f&gt;d.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 15. Magnitudes have the same ratio to one another that their equimultiples
                    have—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ma: mb≈a</hi>: δ.</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> are
                    magnitudes of the same kind, and if <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">a:c≈byd.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 17. If <hi rend="italic">a + b :b≈c + d :d,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>: δ = <hi rend="italic">c: d.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 18 (converse to 17). If <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ=c: <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> then <hi rend="italic">a + b:b≈c+d:d.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 19. If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> are
                    quantities of the same kind, and if <hi rend="italic">a :b≈c :d,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">a-c</hi>: δ <hi rend="italic">-d≈a :b.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 54. Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">If there be three magnitudes, and other three,
                    which have the same ratio, taken two and two, then if the first be greater than
                    the third, the fourth shall be greater than the sixth; and if equal, equal; and
                    if less, less.</hi></p>
                <p>If we understand by <hi rend="italic">a :b :e: d :c: ...</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=a'</hi><hi rend="italic">:b' :d :d' :d:</hi><hi rend="italic">. . .</hi> that
                    the ratio of any two consecutive magnitudes on the first side equals that of the
                    corresponding magnitudes on the second side, we may write this theorem in
                    symbols, thus :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> be
                    quantities of one, and <hi rend="italic">d, e,f</hi> magnitudes of the sama or
                    any other kind, such that <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ: <hi rend="italic">c≈d :e
                    :f</hi> and if <hi rend="italic">afi&gt;c,</hi> then &lt;ζ&gt; <hi rend="italic"
                    >f,</hi> but if ∙ <hi rend="italic">a=c,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">d=</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and if α&lt;c, then <hi rend="italic">d∙&lt;ff.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 21. If <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi rend="italic">b=e</hi>:/and δ <hi
                    rend="italic">:c≈d: e,</hi> or if <hi rend="italic">a</hi>: δ: c= -: -: 1</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> and if <hi rend="italic">afi&gt;c,</hi> then
                    tζ&gt; <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> but if <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">c,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">d≈ f,</hi>
                    and if α&lt;c, then <hi rend="italic">d&lt;Qf.</hi></p>
                <p>By aid of these two propositions the following two are proved.</p>
                <p>§ 55. Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">If there be any number of magnitudes, and as
                    many others, which have the same ratio, taken two and two in order, the first
                    shall have to the last of the first magnitudes the same ratio which the first of
                    the others has to the last.</hi></p>
                <p>We may state it more generally, thus :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a: b: c: d: e:</hi><hi rend="italic">. . . ≈a'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:b': cl :d' :d:</hi><hi rend="italic">. .</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    ,</hi> then not only have two consecutive, but any two magnitudes on the first
                    side, the same ratio as the corresponding magnitudes on the other. For
                    instance—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a∙.c≈a</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">:d; b: e≈b':el,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Prop. 23 we state only in symbols, viz. :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a:b:c:d:e:...≈^,:\.\.\,ſt...,</hi><hi rend="italic">a b d

                    >b',</hi> and so on.</p>
                <p>Prop. 24 comes to this: If <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >e:</hi><hi rend="italic">b≈f∙.</hi><hi rend="italic">d,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">a + c</hi>: δ≡c+∕ <hi rend="italic">:d.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of the proportions which are considered in the above propositions have
                    special names. These we have omitted, as being of no use, since algebra has
                    enabled us to bring the different operations contained in the propositions under
                    a common point of view.</p>
                <p>§ 56. The last proposition in the fifth book is of a different character.</p>
                <p>Prop. 25. <hi rend="italic">If four magnitudes of the same kind be proportional,
                    the greatest and least of them together shall be greater than the other two
                    together.</hi> In symbols—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> be magnitudes of the
                    same kind, and if <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c :d,</hi> and if <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is the greatest, hence <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the least, then <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">+ dfi&gt;b</hi> + c.</p>
                <p>§ 57. We return once again to the question, What is a ratio? We have seen that we
                    may treat ratios as magnitudes, and that all ratios are magnitudes of the same
                    kind, for we may compare any two as to their magnitude. It will presently be
                    shown that ratios of lines may be considered as <hi rend="italic">quotients</hi>
                    of lines, so that a ratio appears as answer to the question, How often is one
                    line contained in another? But the answer to this question is given by a number,
                    at least in some cases, and in all cases if we admit incommensurable numbers.
                    Considered from this point of view, we may say the fifth book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements</hi> shows that some of the simpler algebraical
                    operations hold for incommensurable numbers. In the ordinary algebraical
                    treatment of numbers this proof is altogether omitted, or given by a process of
                    limits which does not seem to be natural to the subject.</p>
                <p>r <hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> VI.</p>
                <p>§ 58. The sixth book contains the theory of similar figures. After a few
                    definitions explaining terms, the first proposition gives the first application
                    of the theory of proportion.</p>
                <p>Prop. 1. <hi rend="italic">Triangles and parallelograms of the same altitude are
                    to one another as their bases.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof has already been considered in § 49.</p>
                <p>From this follows easily the important theorem</p>
                <p>Prop. 2. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the
                    sides of a triangle, it shall cut the other sides, or those sides produced,
                    proportionally; and if the sides or the sides produced be cut proportionally,
                    the straight line which joins the points of section, shall be parallel to the
                    remaining side of the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 59. The next proposition, together with one added by Simson as Prop. A, may be
                    expressed more conveniently if we introduce a modern phraseology, viz., if in a
                    line AB we assume a point C between A and B, we shall say that C divides AB
                    internally in the ratio AC: CB; but if C be taken in the line AB produced, we
                    shall say that AB is divided externally in the ratio AC: CB.</p>
                <p>The two propositions then come to this:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 3).— <hi rend="italic">The bisector of
                    an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side internally in a ratio equal to
                    the ratio of the two sides including that angle;</hi> and conversely, <hi
                    rend="italic">if a line through the vertex of a triangle divide the base
                    internally in the ratio of the two other sides, then that line bisects the angle
                    at the vertex.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Simson’s Prop. A).— <hi
                    rend="italic">The line which bisects an</hi><hi rend="italic">exterior</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">angle of a triangle divides the opposite side externally in the
                    ratio of the other sides;</hi> and conversely, <hi rend="italic">if a line
                    through the vertex of a triangle divide the base externally in the ratio of the
                    sides, then it bisects an exterior angle at the vertex of the triangle.</hi></p>
                <p>If we combine both we have—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The two lines which bisect
                    the interior and exterior angles at one vertex of a triangle divide the opposite
                    side internally and externally in the same ratio, viz., in the ratio of the
                    other two sides.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 60. The next four propositions contain the theory of similar triangles, of
                    which four cases are considered. They may be stated together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Two triangles are
                    similar,—</hi></p>

                <p>2. (Prop. 5). <hi rend="italic">If the sides of the one are proportional to those

                    obtuse; homologous sides being in each case those which are opposite equal
                    angles.</hi></p>
                <p>An important application of these theorems is at once made to a right-angled

                    >Corollary.—</hi> From this it is manifest that the perpendicular drawn from the

                    between the segments of the base, and also that each of the sides is a mean
                    proportional between the base and the segment of the base adjacent to that
                    side.</p>
                <p>§ 61. There follow four propositions containing problems, viz., in language
                    slightly different from Euclid’s :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 9. <hi rend="italic">To divide a straight line into a given number of equal
                    parts.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 10. <hi rend="italic">To divide a straight line in a given ratio.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 11. <hi rend="italic">To find a third proportional to two given straight

                <p>Prop. 12. <hi rend="italic">To find a fourth proportional to three given straight
                    lines.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 13. <hi rend="italic">To find a mean proportional between two given
                    straight lines.</hi></p>
                <p>The last three may be written as equations with one unknown quantity,—viz., if we
                    call the given straight lines <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> and the required
                    line <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> we have to find, a line <hi rend="italic">x

                    b.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall see presently how these may be written without the signs of ratios.</p>
                <p>§ 62. Euclid considers next proportions connected with parallelograms and
                    triangles which are equal in area.</p>
                <p>Prop. 14. <hi rend="italic">Equal parallelograms which have one angle of the one
                    equal to one angle of the other have their sides about the equal angles
                    reciprocally proportional; and parallelograms which have one angle of the one
                    equal to one angle of the other, and their sides about the equal angles
                    reciprocally proportional, are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 15. <hi rend="italic">Equal triangles which have one angle of the one equal
                    to one angle of the other, have their sides about the equal angles reciprocally
                    proportional; and triangles which have one angle of the one equal to one angle
                    of the other, and their sides about the equal angles reciprocally proportional,
                    are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>The latter proposition is really the same as the former, for if, as in the
                    accompanying diagram, in the figure belonging to the former the two equal
                    parallelograms AB and BC be bisected by the lines DF and EG, and if EF be drawn,
                    we get the figure belonging to the latter.</p>
                <p>It is worth noticing that the lines FE and DG are parallel. We may state
                    therefore the theorem—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If two triangles are equal
                    in area, and have one angle in the one vertically opposite to one angle in the
                    other, then the two straight lines which join the remaining two vertices of the
                    one to those of the other triangle are parallel.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 63. A most important theorem is</p>
                <p>Prop. 16. <hi rend="italic">If four straight lines be proportionals, the
                    rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the
                    means; and if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the rectangle
                    contained by the means, the four straight lines are proportionals.</hi></p>
                <p>In symbols, if <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> are the
                    four lines, and if <hi rend="italic">a: b≈c: d,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">ad ≈
                    be;</hi> and conversely, if <hi rend="italic">ad≈bc,</hi> then <hi rend="italic"
                    >a:b≈c:d,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">be</hi>
                    denote (as in § 20), the areas of the rectangles contained by <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> respectively.</p>
                <p>This allows us to transform every proportion between four lines into an equation
                    between two products.</p>
                <p>It shows further that the operation of forming a product of two lines, and the
                    operation of forming their ratio are each the inverse of the other.</p>
                <p>If we now define a quotient ~ of two lines as the <hi rend="italic">number</hi>
                    which multiplied into <hi rend="italic">b</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    so that <hi rend="italic">↑</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=</hi><hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> we see that from the equality of two
                    quotients <hi rend="italic"> a</hi><hi rend="italic">c_ b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >~d</hi> follows, if we multiply both sides by <hi rend="italic">bd,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">⅛b.d =^d.b,</hi><hi rend="italic">o a</hi><hi rend="italic">ad ≈

                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n398/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0398-0385"/>
                <p>But from this it follows according to the last theorem that <hi rend="italic">a:
                    b</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">c: d.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence we conclude that the quotient ſt and the ratio <hi rend="italic">a: b</hi>
                    are different forms of the same magnitude, only with this important difference
                    that the quotient would have a meaning only if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> have a common measure, until we introduce incommensurable
                    numbers, while the ratio <hi rend="italic">a: b</hi> has always a meaning, and
                    thus gives rise to the introduction of incommensurable numbers.</p>
                <p>Thus it is really the theory of ratios in the fifth book which enables us to
                    extend the geometrical calculus given before in connexion with Book II. It will
                    also be seen that if we write the ratios in Book V. as quotients, or rather as
                    fractions, then most of the theorems state properties of quotients or of
                    fractions.</p>
                <p>§ 64. Prop. 17 contains only a special case of 16. After the problem, Prop. 18.
                    <hi rend="italic">On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure
                    similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure,</hi> there follows
                    another fundamental theorem:</p>
                <p>Pro;». 19. <hi rend="italic">Similar triangles are to one another in the
                    duplicate ratio of their homologous sides.</hi> In other words, the areas of
                    similar triangles are to one another as the squares on homologous sides. This is
                    generalized in</p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">Similar polygons may be divided into the same number
                    of similar triangles, having the same ratio to one another that the polygons
                    have; and the polygons are to one another in the duplicate ratio of their
                    homologous sides.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 65. Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">Rectilineal figures which are similar to the
                    same rectilineal figure are also similar to each other,</hi> is an immediate
                    consequence of the definition of similar figures. As similar figures may be said
                    to be equal in “shape” but not in “size,” we may state it also thus:</p>
                <p>“Figures which are equal in shape to a third are equal in shape to each
                    other.”</p>
                <p>Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">If four straight lines be</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    figures similarly described on four straight lines be proportionals, those
                    straight lines shall be proportionals.</hi></p>
                <p>This is essentially the same as the following :—</p>

                <p>§ 66. <hi rend="smallcaps">Noav</hi> follows a proposition which has been much
                    discussed with regard to Euclid’s exact meaning in saying that a ratio is <hi
                    rend="italic">compounded</hi> of two other ιatios, viz.:</p>
                <p>Prop. 23. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms which are equiangular to one another,
                    hare to one another the ratio which is compounded of the ratios of their

                <p>The proof of the proposition makes its meaning clear. In symbols the ratio <hi

                <p>The theorem in Prop. 23 is the foundation of all mensuration of areas. From it we
                    see at once that two rectangles have the ratio of their areas compounded of the

                    rend="italic">cd'</hi></p>
                <p>This shows how to multiply quotients in our geometrical calculus.</p>
                <p>Further, <hi rend="italic">Two triangles have the ratios of their areas

                    is equal in area to half a parallelogram which has the same base and the same
                    altitude.</p>
                <p>To bring these theorems to the form in which they are usually given, we assume a
                    straight line <hi rend="italic">u</hi> as our unit of length (generallv an inch,
                    a foot, a mile, &amp;c.), and determine the number α which expresses how often

                    equals the product of the numerical values of base and altitude, and similarly
                    the number of unit squares contained in a triangle equals half the product of
                    the numerical values of base and altitude.</p>
                <p>This is often stated by saying that the area of a parallelogram is equal to the
                    product of the base and the altitude, meaning by this product the product of the
                    numerical values, and not the product as defined above in § 20.</p>
                <p>§ 68. Propositions 24 and 26 relate to parallelograms about diagonals, such as
                    are considered in Book I., 43. They are—</p>
                <p>Prop. 24. <hi rend="italic">Parallelograms about the diameter of any
                    parallelogram are similar to the whole parallelogram and to one another;</hi>
                    and its converse (Prop. 26), <hi rend="italic">If two similar parallelograms
                    have a common angle, and be similarly situated, they are about the same
                    diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>Between these is inserted a problem.</p>
                <p>Prop. 25. <hi rend="italic">To describe a rectilineal figure which shall be
                    similar to one given rectilinear figure, and equal to another given rectilineal
                    figure.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 69. Prop. 27 contains a theorem relating to the theory of maxima and minima. We
                    may state it thus:</p>
                <p>Prop 27 <hi rend="italic">If a parallelogram be divided into two by a straight
                    line cutting the base, and if on half the base another parallelogram be
                    constructed similar to one of those parts, then this third parallelogram is
                    greater than the other part.</hi></p>
                <p>Of far greater interest than this general theorem is a special case of it, where
                    the parallelograms are changed into rectangles, and where one of the parts into
                    which the parallelogram is divided is made a square; for then the theorem
                    changes into one which is easily recognized to be identical with the
                    following:—</p>

                <p>This may also be stated thus :—</p>

                    the same area the square has the least perimeter.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 70. The next three propositions contain problems which may be said to be
                    solutions of quadratic equations. The first two are, like the last, involved in
                    somewhat obscure language. We transcribe them as follows: —</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem.—</hi> To describe on a given base a parallelogram, and
                    to divide it either internally (Prop. 28) or externally (Prop. 29) from a point

                    in area to a given figure), whilst the other has a given shape (is similar to a
                    given parai leiogi am).</p>

                    parallelogram which determine the shape of the second of the required

                <p>If we substitute the value of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> we get <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a -</hi><hi rend="italic">x)x=^-</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or, <hi

                <p>The second case (Prop. 29) gives rise, in the same manner, to the quadratic <hi

                <p>The next problem—</p>

                <p>This is, therefore, only a special case of the last, and is, besides, an old
                    acquaintance, being essentially the same problem as that proposed in II. 11.</p>

                <p>Prop. 80 may therefore be solved in two ways, either by aid of Prop. 29 or by aid
                    of II. 11. Euclid gives both solutions.</p>
                <p>§71. Prop. 31 (Theorem). <hi rend="italic">In any right-angled, triangle, any

                    angle,—</hi> is a pretty generalization of the theorem of Pythagoras (I.
                    47).</p>
                <p>Leaving out the next proposition, which is of little interest, we come to the
                    last in this book.</p>
                <p>Prop. 83. <hi rend="italic">In equal circles angles, xchether at the centres or
                    the circumferences, have the same ratio which the arcs on which they stand have
                    to one another; so also have the sectors.</hi></p>
                <p>Of this, the part relating to angles at the centre is of special importance; it
                    enables us to measure angles by arcs.</p>
                <p>With this closes that part of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> which is
                    devoted to the study of figures in a plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> XI.</p>
                <p>§ 72. In this book figures are considered which are not confined to a plane,
                    viz., first relations between lines and planes in space, and afterwards
                    properties of solids.</p>
                <p>Of new definitions we mention those which relate to the perpendicularity and the
                    inclination of lines and planes.</p>
                <p>Def. 3. <hi rend="italic">A straight line is perpendicular, or at right angles,
                    to a plane when it makes right angles with every straight line meeting it in
                    that plane.</hi></p>
                <p>The definition of perpendicular planes (Def. 4) offers no difficulty. Euclid
                    defines the inclination of lines to planes and of planes to planes (Defs. 5 and
                    6) by aid of plane angles, included by straight lines, with which we have been
                    made familiar in the first books.</p>
                <p>The other important definitions are those of parallel planes, which never meet
                    (Def. 8), and of solid angles formed by three or more planes meeting in a point
                    (Def. 9).</p>
                <p>To these we add the definition of a line parallel to a plane as a line which does
                    not meet the plane.</p>
                <p>§ 73. Before we investigate the contents of Book XL, it will be well to
                    recapitulate shortly what we know of planes and lines from the definitions and
                    axioms of the first book. There a plane has been defined as a surface which has
                    the property that every straight line which joins two points in it lies
                    altogether in it. This is equivalent to saying.that a straight line which has
                    two points in a plane lias all points in the pla-e. Hence, a straight line which
                    does not lie in the plane cannot have more than one point in common with the
                    plane. This is virtually the same as Euclid’s Prop. 1, viz.: —</p>
                <p>Prop. 1. <hi rend="italic">One part of a straight line cannot be in a plane and
                    another part without it.</hi></p>
                <p>It also follows, as was pointed out in § 3, in discussing the definitions of Book
                    I., that a plane is determined already by one straight line and a point without
                    it, viz., if all lines be drawn through the point, and cutting the line, they
                    will form a plane.</p>
                <p>This may be stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A plane is determined—</hi></p>
                <p>1st, <hi rend="italic">By a straight line and a point which does not lie on
                    it;</hi></p>
                <p>2d, <hi rend="italic">By three points which do not lie in a straight line</hi>;
                    for if two of these points be joined by a straight line we have case 1;</p>
                <p>3d, <hi rend="italic">By two intersecting straight lines;</hi> for the point of
                    intersection aud two other points, one in each line, give case 2;</p>
                <p>4th, <hi rend="italic">By two parallel lines</hi> (Def. 35, 1.).</p>
                <p>The third case of this theorem is Euclid’s</p>
                <p>Prop. 2. <hi rend="italic">Two straight lines which cut one another are</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τn</hi><hi rend="italic">one plane, and three straight lines which
                    meet one another arc in one plane.</hi></p>
                <p>And the fourth is Euclid’s</p>
                <p>Prop. 7. <hi rend="italic">If two straight lines be pa.rallcl, the straight line
                    drawn from any point in one to any point in the other is in the same plane with
                    the parallels.</hi> From the definition of a plane further follows *</p>
                <p>Prop. 3. <hi rend="italic">If two planes cut one another, their common section is
                    a straight line.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 74. Whilst these propositions are virtually contained in the definition of a
                    plane, the next gives us a new and fundamental property of space, showing at the
                    same time that it is possible to have a straight line perpendicular to a plane,
                    according to Def. 3. It states—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 4).— <hi rend="italic">If a straight
                    line is perpendicular to two straight lines in a plane which it meets, then it
                    is perpendicular to all lines in the plane which it meets, and hence it is
                    perpendicular to the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>Def. 3 may be stated thus: If a straight line is perpendicular to a plane, then
                    it is perpendicular to every line in the plane which it meets. The converse to
                    this would be <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">All straight
                    lines which meet a given straight line in the same point, and arc perpendicular
                    to it, lie in a plane which is perpendicular to that line.</hi></p>
                <p>This Euclid states thus:</p>
                <p>Prop. 5. <hi rend="italic">If three straight lines med all at one point, and a
                    straight</hi><hi rend="italic">line stands at right angles to each of them at
                    that point, the three straight lines shall be in one and the same
                    plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§75. There follow theorems relating to the theory of parallel lilies in space,
                    viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 6).— <hi rend="italic">Any two lines
                    which are perpendicular to the same plane are parallel to each other</hi>; aud
                    conversely <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 8).— <hi rend="italic">If of
                    two parallel straight lines one is perpendicular to a plane, the other is so
                    also.</hi></p>
                <p>Further, the important theorems</p>
                <p>Prop. 9. <hi rend="italic">Two straight lines which arc each of them parallel to
                    the same straight line, and not in the same plane with it, are parallel to one
                    another;</hi> where the words, “and not in the same plane with it,” may be left
                    out, for they exclude the case of three parallels in a plane, which has been
                    proved before; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> (Prop. 10).— <hi
                    rend="italic">If two angles in different planes have the two limits of the one
                    parallel to. those of the other, then the angles are equal.</hi> That their
                    planes are parallel is shown later on in Prop. 15.</p>
                <p>This theorem is not necessarily true, for the angles in question may be
                    supplementary; but then the one angle will be equal to that which is adjacent
                    and supplementary to the other, and this latter angle will also have its limits
                    parallel to those of the first.</p>
                <p>From this theorem it follows that if we take any two straight lines in space
                    which do not meet, and if we draw through any point P in space two lines
                    parallel to them, then the angle included by these lines will always be the
                    same, whatever the position of the point P may be. This angle has in modern
                    times been called the angle between the given lines :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definition.—</hi><hi rend="italic">By the angles between two
                    not intersecting lines we understand the angles which two intersecting lines
                    include that are parallel respectively to the two given lines.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 76. It is now possible to solve the following two problems :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Problem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">To draw a straight line
                    perpendicular to a givenplane from a given point which lies</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Not in the plane</hi> (Prop. 11).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">In the plane</hi> (Prop. 12).</p>
                <p>The second case is easily reduced to the first—viz., if by aid of the first we
                    have drawn any perpendicular to the plane from some point without it, we need
                    only draw through the given point in the plane a line parallel to it, in order
                    to have the required perpendicular given. The solution of the first part is of
                    interest in itself. It depends upon a construction which may be expressed as a
                    theorem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If from a point A without a
                    plane a perpendicular AB be drawn to the plane, and if from the foot B of this
                    perpendicular another perpendicular BC be drawn to any straight line in the
                    plane, then the straight line joining A to the foot C of this second
                    perpendicular will also be perpendicular to the line in the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>The theory of perpendiculars to a plane is concluded by the theorem—</p>
                <p>Prop. 13. <hi rend="italic">Through any point in space, whether in or without a
                    plane, only one straight line can be drawn perpendicular to the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 77. The next four propositions treat of parallel planes. It is shown <hi
                    rend="italic">that planes which have a common perpendicular arc parallel</hi>
                    (Prop. 14); <hi rend="italic">that two planes are parallel if</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tιco</hi><hi rend="italic">intersecting straight lines in the one
                    are parallel respectively to two straight lines in the other plane</hi> (Prop.
                    15); <hi rend="italic">that parallel planes arc cut by any plane in parallel
                    straight lines</hi> (Prop. 16); and lastly, <hi rend="italic">that any two
                    straight lines are cut proportionally by a scries of parallel planes</hi> (Prop.
                    17).</p>
                <p>This theory is made more complete by adding the following theorems, which are
                    easy deductions from the last :— <hi rend="italic">Two parallel planes have
                    common perpendiculars</hi> (converse to 14); and <hi rend="italic">Two planes
                    which are parallel to a third plane arc parallel to each other.</hi></p>
                <p>It will be noted that Prop. 15 at once allows of the solution of the problem:
                    “Through a given point to draw a plane parallel to a given plane.” And it is
                    also easily proved that this problem allows always of one, and only of one,
                    solution.</p>
                <p>§ 78. We come now to planes which are perpendicular to one another. Two theorems
                    relate to them.</p>
                <p>Prop. 18. <hi rend="italic">If a straight line be at right angles to a plane,
                    every plane</hi><hi rend="italic">vehich</hi><hi rend="italic">passes through it
                    shall be at right angles to that plane.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 19. <hi rend="italic">If two planes which cut one another be each of them
                    perpendicular to a third plane, their common section shall be perpendicular to
                    the same plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 79. If three planes pass through a common point, and if they bound each other,
                    a solid angle of three faces, or a <hi rend="italic">trihedral</hi> angle, is
                    formed, and similarly by more planes a solid angle of more faces, or a <hi
                    rend="italic">polyhedral</hi> angle. These have many properties which are quite
                    analogous to those of triangles and polygons in a plane. Euclid states some, viz
                    :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 20. <hi rend="italic">If a solid angle be contained by three plane angles,
                    any two of them are together greater than the third.</hi></p>
                <p>But the next—</p>
                <p>Prop. 21. <hi rend="italic">Every solid angle is contained by plane angles, which
                    are together</hi><hi rend="italic">lese</hi><hi rend="italic">than four right
                    angles</hi> —has no analogous theorem in the plane.</p>

                <p>We may mention, however, that the theorems about triangles contained in the
                    propositions of Book I., which do not depend upon the theory of parallels (that
                    is all up to Prop. 27), have their corresponding theorems about trihedral
                    angles. The latter are formed, if for “side of a triangle” we write “plane
                    angle” or “face” of trihedral angle, and for “angle of triangle” we substitute
                    “angle between two faces” where the planes containing the solid angle are called
                    its <hi rend="italic">faces.</hi> We get, for instance, from I. 4, the theorem,
                    <hi rend="italic">If two trihedral angles have the angles of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tιuo</hi><hi rend="italic">faces in the one equal to the angles of
                    two faces in the other, and have likewise the angles included by these faces
                    equal, then the angles in the remaining faces are equal, and the angles between
                    the other faces are equal each to each, viz., those which are opposite equal
                    faces.</hi> The solid angles themselves are not necessarily equal, for they may
                    be only symmetrical like the right hand and the left.</p>
                <p>The connexion indicated between triangles and trihedral angles will also be
                    recognized in</p>
                <p>Prop. 22. <hi rend="italic">If everytwo of three plane angles be greater than the
                    third, and if the straight lines which contain them be all equal, a triangle may
                    be made of the straight lines that join the extremities of those equal straight
                    lines.</hi></p>
                <p>And Prop. 23. solves the problem, <hi rend="italic">To construct a trihedral
                    angle having the angles of its faces equal to three given plane angles, any two
                    of them being greater than the third.</hi> It is, of course, analogous to the
                    problem of constructing a triangle having its sides of given length.</p>
                <p>Two other theorems of this kind are added by Simson in his edition of Euclid’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 80. These are the principal properties of lines and planes in space, but.
                    before we go on to their applications it will be well to define the word <hi
                    rend="italic">distance.</hi> In geometry, distance means always “shortest
                    distance”; viz., the distance of a point from a straight line, or from a plane,
                    is the length of the perpendicular from the point to the line or plane. The
                    distance between two nonintersecting lines is the length of their common
                    perpendicular, there being but one. The distance between two parallel lines or
                    between two parallel planes is the length of the common perpendicular between
                    the lines or the planes.</p>
                <p>§ 81. <hi rend="italic">Parallelepipeds.</hi> — The rest of the book is devoted
                    to the study of the parallelepiped. In Prop. 24 the possibility of such a solid
                    is proved, viz. :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 24. <hi rend="italic">If a solid be contained by six planes two and two of
                    which are parallel, the opposite planes are similar and equal
                    parallelograms.</hi></p>
                <p>Euclid calls this solid henceforth a parallelepiped, though he never defines the
                    word. Either face of it may be taken as <hi rend="italic">base,</hi> and its
                    distance from the opposite face as <hi rend="italic">altitude.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop 25. <hi rend="italic">If a solid parallelepiped be cut by a plane parallel
                    to two of its opposite planes, it divides the whole into two solids, the base of
                    one of</hi><hi rend="italic">τohich</hi><hi rend="italic">shall be to the base
                    of the other as the one solid is to the other.</hi></p>
                <p>This theorem corresponds to the theorem (VI. 1) that parallelograms between the
                    same parallels are to one another as their bases. A simi]ar analogy is to be
                    observed among a number of the remaining propositions.</p>
                <p>§ 82. After solving a few problems we come to</p>
                <p>Prop. 28. <hi rend="italic">If a solid parallelepiped be cut by a plane passing
                    through the diagonals of two cf the opposite planes, it shall be cut in two
                    equal parts.</hi></p>
                <p>In the proof of this, as of several other propositions, Euclid neglects the
                    difference between solids which are symmetrical like the right hand and the
                    left.</p>
                <p>Prop. 31. <hi rend="italic">Solid parallelepipeds, which arc upon equal bases,
                    and of the same altitude, are equal to one another.</hi></p>
                <p>Props. 29 and 30 contain special cases of this theorem leading up to the proof of
                    the general theorem.</p>
                <p>As consequences of this fundamental theorem we get</p>
                <p>Prop. 32. <hi rend="italic">Solid parallelepipeds, which have the same altitude,
                    are to one another as their bases</hi>; and Prop. 33, <hi rend="italic">Similar

                <p>If we consider, as in § 67, the ratios of lines as numbers, we may also say—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The ratio of the volumes of similar parallelepipeds is equal to

                    straight lines be proportionals, the straight lines shall be
                    proportionals.</hi></p>

                <p>Prop. 40 teaches how to compare the volumes of triangular prisms with those of
                    parallelepipeds, by proving <hi rend="italic">that a triangular prism is equal
                    in volume to a parallelepiped, which has its altitude and its base equal to the
                    altitude ancl the base of the triangular prism.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 84. From these propositions follow all results relating to the mensuration of
                    volumes. We shall state these as we did in the case of areas. The starting-point
                    is the “rectangular” parallelepiped, which has every edge perpendicular to the
                    planes it meets, and which takes the place of the rectangle in the plane. If
                    this has all its edges equal we obtain the “cube.”</p>
                <p>If we take a certain line <hi rend="italic">u</hi> as unit length, then the
                    square on <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is the unit of area, and the cube on t¢ the
                    unit of volume, that is to say, if we wish to measure a volume we have to
                    determine how many unit cubes it contains.</p>
                <p>A rectangular parallelepiped has, as a rule, the three edges unequal, which meet
                    at a point. Every other edge is equal to one of them. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the three edges
                    meetin" at a point, then we may take the rectangle, contained by two of them,
                    say by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> as base and the
                    third as altitude. Let V be its volume, V' that of another rectangular
                    parallelepiped which has the edges <hi rend="italic">a’, b, c,</hi> hence the
                    same base as the first. It follows then easily, from Prop. 25 or 32, that V: <hi

                    in words, <hi rend="italic">Rectangular parallelepipeds on equal bases are
                    proportional to their altitudes.</hi></p>
                <p>If we have two rectangular parallelepipeds, of which the first has the volume V
                    and the edges <hi rend="italic">a, bfc,</hi> and the second,the volume V' and
                    the edges <hi rend="italic">a', b',</hi><hi rend="italic">cl,</hi> we may
                    compare them by aid of two new ones which have respectively the edges <hi
                    rend="italic">a', b, c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a', b',</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> and the volumes V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. We then have</p>
                <p>V: V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =α: <hi rend="italic">a'</hi>; V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>: V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = δ: <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Compounding these, we have</p>
                <p>V:V'=(a:a')(6:6')(c:c'), or L=*Λ.f..</p>
                <p>V' <hi rend="italic">al V e</hi></p>
                <p>Hence, as a special case, making V' equal to the unit cube V on <hi rend="italic"

                    is equal to tire product of the numerical values of its three edges. This is
                    generally expressed by saying the volume of a rectangular parallelepiped is
                    measured by the product of its sides, or by the product of its base into its
                    altitude, which in this case is the same.</p>
                <p>Prop. 31 allows us to extend this to any parallelepipeds, and Props. 28 or 40, to

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> XII.</p>
                <p>§ 85. In the last part of Book XL we have learnt how to compare the volumes of
                    parallelepipeds and of prisms. In order to determine the volume of any solid
                    bounded by plane faces we must determine the volume of pyramids, for every such
                    solid may be decomposed into a number of pyramids.</p>
                <p>As every pyramid may again be decomposed into triangular pyramids, it becomes
                    only necessary to determine their volume. This is done by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theorem.—</hi> Every triangular pyramid is equal in volume to one third of a
                    triangular prism having the same base and the same altitude as the pyramid.</p>
                <p>This is an immediate consequence of Euclid’s</p>
                <p>Prop. 7. <hi rend="italic">Every prism having a triangular base may be
                    divided</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">do</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">three pyramids that have triangular bases, and arc equal to one
                    another.</hi></p>
                <p>The proof of this theorem is difficult, because the three triangular pyramids
                    into which the prism is divided are by no means equal in shape, and cannot be
                    made to coincide. It has first to be proved that two triangular pyramids have
                    equal volumes, if they have equal bases and equal altitudes. This Euclid does in
                    the following manner. He first shows (Prop. 3) that a triangular pyramid may be
                    divided into four parts, of which two are equal triangular pyramids similar to
                    the whole pyramid, whilst the other two are equal triangular prisms, and
                    further, that these two prisms together are greater than the two pyramids, hence
                    more than half the given pyramid. He next shows (Prop. 4) that if two triangular
                    pyra∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n401/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0401-0388"/>
                <p>nιids are given, having equal bases and equal altitudes, and if each be divided
                    as above, then the two triangular prisms in the one are equal to those in the
                    other, and each of the remaining pyramids in the one has its base and altitude
                    equal to the base and altitude of the remaining pyramids in the other. Hence to
                    these pyramids the same process is again applicable. We are thus enabled to cut
                    out of the two given pyramids equal parts, each greater than half the original
                    pyramid. Of the remainder we can again cut out equal parts greater than half
                    these remainders, and so on as far as we like. This process may be continued
                    till the last remainder is smaller than any assignable quantity, however small.
                    It follows, so we should conclude at present, that the two volumes must be
                    equal, for they cannot differ by any assignable quantity.</p>
                <p>To Greek mathematicians this conclusion offers far greater difficulties. They
                    prove elaborately, by a <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdum,</hi> that the volumes cannot be unequal.
                    This proof must be read in the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> A further
                    discussion of this method of exhaustion, as it is called, would belong to a
                    treatise on the history of geometry. We refer readers to Hankel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte der</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematik</hi> (p. 115 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq).</hi> We must, however, state that we have in the above not
                    proved Euclid’s Prop. 5, but only a special case of it. Euclid does not suppose
                    that the bases of the two pyramids to be compared are equal, and hence he proves
                    that the volumes are as the bases. The reasoning of the proof becomes clearer in
                    the special case, from which the general one may be easily deduced.</p>
                <p>§ 86. Prop. 6 extends the result to pyramids with polygonal bases. From these
                    results follow again the rules at present given for the mensuration of solids,
                    viz., a pyramid is the third part of a triangular prism having the same base and
                    the same altitude. But a triangular prism is equal in volume to a parallelepiped
                    which has the same base and altitude. Hence if B is the base and <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> the altitude, we have</p>
                <p>Volume of prism = <hi rend="smallcaps">Bä,</hi> Volume of pyramid = -∣ <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bä,</hi> statements which have to be taken in the sense that B
                    means the number of square units in the base, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the
                    number of units of length in the altitude, or that B and <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> denote the numerical values of base and altitude.</p>
                <p>§ 87. A method similar to that used in proving Prop. 5 leads to the following
                    results relating to solids bounded by simple curved surfaces :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 10. <hi rend="italic">Every cone is the third part of a cylinder which has
                    the same base, and is of an equal altitude with it.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 11. <hi rend="italic">Cones and cylinders of the same altitude are to

                <p>Prop. 12. <hi rend="italic">Similar cones and cylinders have to</hi><hi

                <p>Prop. 13. <hi rend="italic">If a cylinder be cut by a plane parallel</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Cyli7tdaers</hi><hi rend="italic">on the same base are
                    proportional to their altitudes.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 14. <hi rend="italic">Cones and cylinders upon equal bases are to one
                    another as their altitudes.</hi></p>
                <p>Prop. 15. <hi rend="italic">The bases and altitudes of</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">another.</hi></p>
                <p>These theorems again lead to formulae in mensuration, if we compare a cylinder
                    with a prism having its base and altitude equal to the base and altitude of the
                    cylinder. This may be done by the method of exhaustion. We get, then, the result
                    that their bases are equal, and have, if B denotes the numerical value of the
                    base, and <hi rend="smallcaps">ä</hi> that of the altitude,</p>
                <p>Volume of cylinder = <hi rend="smallcaps">Bä.</hi></p>

                    rend="italic">ð</hi></p>
                <p>§ 88. The remaining propositions relate to circles and spheres. Of the sphere
                    only one property is proved, viz. :—</p>
                <p>Prop. 18. <hi rend="italic">Spheres have</hi><hi rend="italic">to one another the
                    triplicate ratio</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">that</hi><hi

                    like that of the circle, the cylinder, and the cone, had not been settled in the
                    time of Euclid. It was done by Archimedes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Book</hi> XIII.</p>
                <p>§ 89. The 13th and last book of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> is
                    devoted to the regular solids. It is shown that there are five of them, viz.
                    :—</p>
                <p>1. The regular <hi rend="italic">tetrahedron,</hi> with 4 triangular faces and 4
                    vertices;</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">cube,</hi> with 8 vertices and 6 square faces;</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">octohedron,</hi> with 6 vertices and 8 triangular
                    faces;</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">dodecahedron,</hi> with 12 pentagonal faces, 3 at each
                    of the 20 vertices;</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">icosahedron,</hi> with 20 triangular faces, 5 at each of
                    the 12 vertices.</p>
                <p>It is shown how to inscribe these solids in a given sphere, and how to determine
                    the lengths of their edges.</p>
                <p>These results are—if <hi rend="italic">r</hi> denotes the radius of the
                    circumscribed sphere, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the side of the regular

                <p>§ 90. The 13th book, and therefore the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> conclude
                    with the scholium, “that no other regular solid exists besides the five ones
                    enumerated.”</p>
                <p>The proof is very simple. Each face is a regular polygon, hence the angles of the
                    faces at any vertex must be .angles in equal regular polygons, must be togetheχ∙
                    less than four right angles (XL 21), and must be three or more in number. Each
                    angle in a regular triangle equals two-thirds of one right angle. Hence it is
                    possible to form a solid angle with three, four, or five regular triangles or
                    faces. These give the solid angles of the tetrahedron, the octohedron, and the
                    icosahedron. The angle in a square (the regular quadrilateral) equals one right
                    angle. Hence three will form a solid angle, that of the cube, and four will not.
                    The angle in the regular pentagon equals -ð-of a right angle. Hence three of
                    them equal y (t,e., less than 4) right angles, and form the solid angle of the
                    dodecahedron. Three regular polygons of six or more sides cannot form a solid
                    angle. Therefore no other regular solids are possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Higher or Projective
                    Geometry.</hi></p>
                <p>It is difficult, at the outset, to characterize Projective Geometry as compared
                    with Euclidian. But a ſew examples will at least indicate the difference between
                    the two.</p>
                <p>In Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> almost all propositions refer to the
                    <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of lines, angles, areas, or volumes, and
                    therefore to measurement. The statement that an angle is right, or that two
                    straight lines are parallel, refers to measurement. On the other hand, the fact
                    that a straight line does or does not cut a circle is independent of
                    measurement, it being dependent only upon the mutual “position” of the line and
                    the circle. This difference becomes clearer if we project any figure from one
                    plane to another. By this the length of lines, the magnitude of angles and
                    areas, is altered, so that the projection, or shadow, of a square on a plane
                    will not be a square; it will, however, be some quadrilateral. Again, the
                    projection of a circle will not be a circle, but some other curve more or less
                    resembling a circle. But one property may be stated at once,—no straight line
                    can cut the projection of a circle in more than two points, because no straight
                    line can cut a circle in more than two points. There are, then, some properties
                    of figures which do not alter by projection, whilst others do. To the latter
                    belong nearly all properties relating to measurement, at least in the form in
                    which they are generally given. The others are said to be projective properties,
                    and their investigation forms the subject of Projective Geometry.</p>
                <p>Different as are the kinds of properties investigated in the old and the new
                    sciences, the methods followed differ in a still greater degree. In Euclid each
                    proposition stands by itself; its connexion with others is never indicated; the
                    leading ideas contained in its proof are not stated; genoral principles do not
                    exist. In the modern methods, on the other hand, the greatest importance is
                    attached to the leading thoughts which pervade the whole; and general
                    principles, which bring whole groups of theorems under one aspect, are given
                    rather than separate propositions. The whole tendency is towards generalization.
                    A straight line is considered as given in its entirety, extending both ways to
                    infinity, while Euclid <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n402/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0402-0389"/> is very careful never to admit anything but
                    finite quantities. The treatment of the infinite is in fact another fundamental
                    difference between the two methods. Euclid avoids it. In modern geometry it is
                    systematically introduced, for only thus is generality obtained.</p>
                <p>Of the different modern methods of geometry, we shall treat principally of the
                    methods of projection and correspondence which have proved to be the most
                    powerful. These have become independent of Euclidian Geometry, especially
                    through the <hi rend="italic">Geometrie der</hi><hi rend="italic">Lage</hi> of
                    V. Staudt, and the <hi rend="italic">Ausdehnungslehre</hi> of Grassmann.</p>
                <p>For the sake of brevity we shall presuppose a knowledge of Euclid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements,</hi> although we shall use only a few of his
                    propositions.</p>
                <p>§ 1. We consider space as filled with points, lines, and planes, and these we
                    call the elements out of which our figures are to be formed, calling any
                    combination of these elements a “figure.”</p>
                <p>By a line we mean a straight line in its entirety, extending both ways to
                    infinity; and by a plane, a plane surface, extending in all directions to
                    infinity. We suppose</p>
                <p>That through any two points in space one and only one line may be drawn (Euch I.,
                    Def. 4, Ax. 10, Post. 2);</p>
                <p>That through any three points which are not in a line, one and only one plane may
                    be placed (compare p. 386, § 73, above);</p>
                <p>That the intersection of two planes is a line (Encl. XI. 13);</p>
                <p>That a line which has two points in common with a plane lies in the plane (Euch
                    I., Def. 7), hence that the intersection of a line and a plane is a single
                    point; and</p>
                <p>That three planes which do not meet in a line have one single point in
                    common.</p>
                <p>These results may be stated differently in the following form;— I. A plane is
                    determined— A point is determined—</p>
                <p>1. By three points which do 1. By three planes which do not lie in a line; not
                    pass through a line;</p>
                <p>2. By two intersecting lines; 2. By two intersecting lines;</p>
                <p>3. By a line and a point which 3. By a line and a plane which does not lie in it.
                    does not pass through it.</p>
                <p>II. A line is determined—</p>
                <p>1. By two points; 2. By two planes.</p>
                <p>The reader will observe that not only are planes determined by points, but also
                    points by planes·; that therefore we have a right to consider the planes as
                    elements, like points; and also that in any one of the above statements we may
                    interchange the words point and plane, and we obtain again a correct statement,
                    provided that these statements themselves are true. As they stand, we ought, in
                    several cases, to add “if they are not parallel,” or some such words, parallel
                    lines and planes being evidently left altogether out of consideration. To
                    correct this we have to reconsider the theory of parallels.</p>
                <p>§ 2. Let us take in a plane a line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (fig. 1), a point S
                    not in this line, and a line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> drawn through S. Then this
                    line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> will meet the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in a
                    point A. If we turn the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> about S towards <hi
                    rend="italic">(f</hi>, its point of intersection with <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    will move along <hi rend="italic">p</hi> towards B, passing, on continued
                    turning, to a greater and greater distance, until it is moved out of our reach.
                    If we turn <hi rend="italic">q</hi> still farther, its continuation will meet
                    <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> but now at the other side of A. The point of
                    intersection has disappeared to the right and reappeared to the left. There is
                    one intermediate position where <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">p—</hi> that is where it does not cut <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> In
                    every other position it cuts <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in some finite point. If,
                    on the other hand, we move the point A to an infinite distance in <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> then the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> which passes
                    through A will be a line which does not cut <hi rend="italic">p</hi> at any
                    finite point. Thus we are led to say: <hi rend="italic">Every</hi> line through
                    S which joins it to any point at an infinite distance in <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> is parallel to <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> But by Euclid’s 12th axiom
                    there is but one line parallel to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> through S. The
                    difficulty in which we are thus involved is due to the fact that we try to
                    reason about infinity as if we, with our finite capabilities, could comprehend
                    the infinite. To overcome this difficulty, we may say that all points at
                    infinity in a line <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> to us as one, and may be
                    replaced by a single “ideal” point, just as all points in a fixed star—which is
                    not at an infinite, only at a great distance—cannot be distinguished by us and
                    to beings on the earth count as one. We may therefore now give the following
                    definitions and axiom:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.</hi> —Lines which meet at infinity are called
                    parallel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Axiom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> All points at an infinite
                    distance in a line may be considered as one single point. <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 4</hi><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> This ideal point is called the point
                    at infinity in the line.</p>
                <p>The axiom is equivalent to Euclid’s Axiom 12, for it follows from either that
                    through any point only one line may be drawn parallel to a given line.</p>
                <p>This point at infinity in a line is reached whether we move a point in the one or
                    in the opposite direction of a line to infinity. A line thus appears closed by
                    this point, and we speak as if we could move a point along the line from one
                    position A to another B in two ways, either through the point at infinity or
                    through finite points only.</p>
                <p>It must never be forgotten that this point at infinity is ideal, that the results
                    based on this assumption are true for that finite region of space which is
                    within our reach, and that beyond this region they may or may not be true, —we
                    do not know.</p>
                <p>The advantage of this view of parallels will become apparent at every step as we
                    go on.</p>
                <p>§ 3. Having thus arrived at the notion of replacing all points at infinity in a
                    line by one ideal point, there is no difficulty in replacing all points at
                    infinity in a plane by one ideal line.</p>
                <p>To make this clear, let us suppose that a line <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which
                    cuts two fixed lines <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in
                    the points A and B, moves parallel to itself to a greater and greater distance.
                    It will at last cut both <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    at their points at infinity, so that a line which joins the two points at
                    infinity in two intersecting lines lies altogether at infinity. Every other line
                    in the plane will meet it therefore at infinity, and thus it contains all points
                    at infinity in the plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">AU</hi><hi rend="italic">points at infinity in a plane lie in a
                    line, which is called the line</hi><hi rend="italic">at</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >infinity in the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>It follows that parallel planes must be considered as planes having a common line
                    at infinity, for any other plane cuts them in parallel lines (Euch XI. 16),
                    which have a point at infinity in common.</p>
                <p>If we next take two intersecting planes, then the point at infinity in their line
                    of intersection lies in both planes, so that their lines at infinity meet. Hence
                    every line at infinity meets every other line at infinity, and they are
                    therefore all in one plane.</p>

                <p>§ 4. We have now the following definitions :—</p>
                <p>Parallel lines are lines which meet at infinity;</p>
                <p>Parallel planes are planes which meet at infinity;</p>
                <p>A line is parallel to a plane if it meets it at infinity.</p>
                <p>Theorems like this—Lines (or planes) which are parallel to a third are parallel
                    to each other—follow at once.</p>
                <p>This view of parallels leads therefore to no contradiction of Euclid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements.</hi></p>
                <p>As immediate consequences we get the propositions :—</p>
                <p>Every line meets a plane in one point, or it lies in it;</p>
                <p>Every plane meets every other plane in a line;</p>
                <p>Any two lines in the same plane meet.</p>
                <p>§ 5. We have called points, lines, and planes the elements of geometrical
                    figures. We also say that an element of one kind <hi rend="italic">contains</hi>
                    one of the other if it lies in it or passes through it.</p>
                <p>All the elements of one kind which are contained in one or two elements of a
                    different kind form aggregates which have to be enumerated. They are the
                    following :—</p>
                <p>I. Of one dimension.</p>
                <p>1. The row, or range, <hi rend="italic">of pointe</hi> formed by all points in a
                    line, which is called its base.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">flat pencil</hi> formed by all the lines through a point
                    in a plane. Its base is the point in the plane.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">axial pencil</hi> formed by all planes through a lino
                    which is called its base or axis.</p>
                <p>II. Of two dimensions.</p>
                <p>1. The field of points and lines—that is, a plane with all its points and all its
                    lines.</p>
                <p>2. The pencil of lines and planes— that is, a point in space with all lines and
                    all planes through it.</p>
                <p>III. Of three dimensions.</p>
                <p>The space of points—that is, all points in space.</p>
                <p>The space of planes—that is, all planes in space⅛ IV. Of four dimensions.</p>
                <p>The space of lines, or all lines in space.</p>
                <p>§ 6. The word dimension in the above needs explanation.</p>
                <p>If in a plane we take a row <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and a pencil with centre Q,
                    then through every point in <hi rend="italic">p</hi> one line in the pencil will
                    pass, and every ray in Q will cut <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in one point, so that
                    we are entitled to say a row contains as many points as a fiat pencil lines,
                    and, we may add, as an axial pencil planes, because an axial pencil is cut by a
                    plane in a flat pencil.</p>
                <p>The number of elements in the row, in the flat pencil, and in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n403/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0403-0390"/> axial pencil is, of course, infinite and
                    indefinite too, but the same in all. For a moment we shall treat it as being a
                    definite number which we denote by <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Then a plane
                    contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> points and as many lines. To see this,
                    take a flat pencil in a plane. It contains <hi rend="italic">a</hi> lines, and
                    each line contains <hi rend="italic">a</hi> points, whilst each point in the
                    plane lies on one of these lines. Similarly, in a plane each line cuts a fixed
                    line in a point. But this line is cut at each point by <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    lines and contains α points; hence there are α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    lines in a plane.</p>
                <p>A pencil in space contains as many lines as a plane contains points and as many
                    planes as a plane contains lines, for any plane cuts the pencil in a field of
                    points and lines. Hence a pencil contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> lines
                    and α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> planes. <hi rend="italic">The field and the
                    pencil are of two dimensions.</hi></p>
                <p>To count the number of points in space we observe that each point lies on some
                    line in a pencil. But the pencil contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    lines, and each line α points; hence space contains α <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> points. Each plane cuts any fixed plane in a line. But a plane contains α
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> lines, and through each pass <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> planes; therefore space contains α <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi>
                    planes.</p>
                <p>Hence space contains as many planes as points, but it contains an infinite number
                    of times more lines than points or planes. To count them, notice that every line
                    cuts a fixed plane in one point. But α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> lines pass
                    through each point, and there are α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> points in the
                    plane. Hence there are α <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> lines in space. <hi
                    rend="italic">The space of points and planes is of three dimensions, but the
                    space of lines is of four dimensions.</hi></p>
                <p>A field of points or lines contains an infinite number of rows and flat pencils;
                    a pencil contains an infinite number of flat pencils and of axial pencils; space
                    contains a triple infinite number of pencils and of fields, α <hi

                <p>§ 7. The above enumeration allows a classification of figures.</p>
                <p>Figures in a row consist of groups of points only, and figures in the flat or
                    axial pencil consist of groups of lines or planes. In the plane we may draw
                    polygons; and in the pencil or in the point, solid angles, and so on.</p>
                <p>We may also distinguish the different measurements. We have— In the row, lengtli
                    of segment;</p>
                <p>In the flat pencil, angles;</p>
                <p>In the axial pencil, dihedral angles between two planes;</p>
                <p>I a the plane, areas;</p>
                <p>In the pencil, solid angles;</p>
                <p>In the space of points or planes, volumes.</p>

                <p>§ 8. Any two points A and B in space determine on the line through them a finite
                    part, which may be considered as being described by a point moving from A to B.
                    This we shall denote by AB, and distinguish it from BA, which is supposed as
                    being described by a point moving from B to A, and hence in a direction or in a
                    “sense” opposite to AB. Such a finite line, which has a definite sense, we shall
                    call a “segment,” so that AB and BA denote different segments, which are said to
                    be equal in length but of opposite sense. The one sense is often called positive
                    and the other negative.</p>
                <p>In introducing the word “sense” for direction in a line, we have the word
                    direction reserved for direction of the line itself, so that different lines
                    have different directions, unless they be parallel, whilst in each line we have
                    a positive and negative sense.</p>
                <p>We may also say, with Professor Clifford, that AB denotes the “step ’’ of going
                    from A to B.</p>
                <p>§ 9. If we now have three points A, B, C in a line (fig. 2), the step AB will
                    bring us from A to B, and the step BC from B to C. Hence both steps are
                    equivalent to the one step AC. This is expressed by saying that AC is the “sum”
                    of AB and BC; in symbols—</p>
                <p>AB + BC = AC, where account is to be taken of the sense.</p>
                <p>This equation is true whatever be the position of the three points on the line.
                    As a special case we have</p>
                <p>AB + BA=0 (1), and similarly</p>
                <p>AB + BC + CA=0 (2), which again is tine for any three points in a line.</p>
                <p>We further write</p>
                <p>AB=-BA, where — denotes negative sense.</p>
                <p>We can then, just as in algebra, change subtraction of segments into addition by
                    changing the sense, so that AB—CB is the same as AB + (-CB) or AB + BC. A figure
                    will at once show the truth of this. The sense is, in fact, in every respect
                    equivalent to the “sign” of a number iu algebra.</p>
                <p>§ 10. Of the many formulae which exist between points in a line we shall have to
                    use only one more, which connects the segments between any four points A, B, C.
                    D in a line. We have—</p>
                <p>BC = BD+DC, CA = CD +DA, AB≈AD+DB; or multiplying these by AD, BD, CD
                    respectively, we get—</p>
                <p>BC . AD = BD. AD + DC. AD = BD. AD-CD. AD</p>
                <p>CA . BD = CD . BD + DA. BD = CD . BD - AD. BD</p>
                <p>AB. CD = AD . CD + DB . CD = AD. CD - BD. CD.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the sum of the right hand sides vanishes, hence that</p>
                <p>BC. AD + CA. BD + AB. CD - 0 . . . (3)</p>
                <p>for any four points on a line.</p>
                <p>§ 11. If C is any point in the line AB, then we say that C AC</p>
                <p>divides the segment AB in the ratio ð— , account being taken of the sense of the
                    two segments AC and CB. If C lies between A and C the ratio is positive, as AC
                    and CB have the same sense. But if C lies without the segment AB, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if C divides AB externally, then the ratio is negative.
                    To see how the value of this ratio changes with C, . _</p>
                <p>we will move C ft † ¾! B Ç</p>
                <p>along the whole _. „</p>
                <p>line (fig. 3), whilst <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> S- <hi rend="superscript">
                    0</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>A and B remain fixed. If C lies at the point A, then AC = 0, hence the ratio AC:
                    CB vanishes. As C moves towards B, AC increases and CB decreases, so that our
                    ratio increases. At the middle point Μ of AB it assumes the value +1, and then
                    increases till it reaches an infinitely large value, when C arrives at B. On
                    passing beyond B the ratio becomes negative. If C is at P we have AC=AP=AB + BP,
                    hence</p>
                <p>AC AB BP AB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>CB~PB <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> PB BP <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> *</p>
                <p>In the last expression the ratio AB: BP is positive, has its greatest value ∞
                    when C coincides with B, and vanishes when BC becomes infinite. Hence, as C
                    moves from B to the right to the point at infinity, the ratio AC: CB varies from
                    —∞ to —1.</p>
                <p>If on the other hand C is to the left of A, say at Q, we have AC = AQ = AB + BQ =
                    AB-QB, hence —</p>
                <p>Here AB &lt;QB, hence the ratio AB: QB is positive and always less than one, so
                    that the whole is negative and &lt;1. H C is at the point at infinity it is —1,
                    and then increases as C moves to the right, till for C at A we get the ratio =0.
                    Hence—</p>
                <p>“As C moves along the line from an infinite distance to the left to an infinite
                    distance at the right, the ratio always increases; it starts with the value —1,
                    reaches 0 at A, +1 at Μ, ∞ at B, changes now sign to — ∞ , and increases till at
                    an infinite distance it reaches again the value —1. <hi rend="italic">It assumes

                    >π</hi> from S as centre of projection. If we have two planes τr and <hi
                    rend="italic">π'</hi> and a point S, we may project every point A in π to the
                    other plane. If A' is the projection of A, then A is also the projection of A',
                    so that the relations are reciprocal. To every figure in <hi rend="italic"
                    >π</hi><hi rend="italic">we</hi> get as its projection a corresponding figure in
                    π'.</p>
                <p>It will be our business to find such properties of figures as remain true for the
                    projection, and which are called projective properties. For this purpose it will
                    be sufficient to consider at first only constructions in one plane.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose we have given in a plane two lines <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and ſk
                    and a centre S (fig. 4); we may then project the points in <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> from S to p'. Let A', B'... be the projections of A, B..., the point at
                    infinity in <hi rend="italic">p</hi> which we shall denote by J will be
                    projected into a finite point Γ inp', viz., into the point where the parallel to
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> through S cuts ſk. Similarly one point J in <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> will be projected into the point Γ at infinity in <hi
                    rend="italic">V.</hi> This point J is of course the point where <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">p.</hi> We thus see that every point in 79 is projected into a
                    single point in <hi rend="italic">p</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>A glance at fig. 5 shows that a segment AB will be projected into a segment A'B'
                    which is not equal to it, at least not as a rule; and also that the ratio AC: CB
                    is not equal to the ratio A'C': C'B' formed by the projections. These ratios
                    will become equal only if <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi>
                    are parallel, for in this case the triangle SAB is similar to the triangle
                    SA'B'. Between three points in a line and their projections there exists
                    therefore in general no relation. But between four points a relation does
                    exist.</p>
                <p>§ 13. Let A, B, C, D be four points in <hi rend="italic">p, A!,</hi> B', C', D'
                    their projections in <hi rend="italic">p',</hi> then the ratio of the two ratios
                    AC: CB and AD: DB into which C and D divide the segment AB is equal to the
                    corresponding expression between A', B', C', D'. In symbols we have—</p>

                <p>. This is easily proved by aid of similar triangles.</p>
                <p>Through the points A and B on <hi rend="italic">p</hi> draw parallels to <hi
                    rend="italic">p',</hi> which cut the projecting rays in C <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>We have therefore—</p>

                <p>This result is of fundamental importance.</p>
                <p>The expression formed has been called by Chasles the anharmonic ratio of the four
                    points A, B, C, D. Instead of this Professor Clifford has proposed the shorter
                    and more expressive, name of “crossratio.’' We shall adopt the latter. We have
                    then the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fundamental Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">The
                    cross-ratio of four points in a tine is equal to the cross-ratio of their
                    projections on any other line which lies in the same plane with it.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 14. Before we draw conclusions from this result, we must investigate the
                    meaning of a cross-ratio somewhat more fully.</p>
                <p>If four points A, B, C, D are given, and we wish to form their cross-ratio, we
                    have first to divide them into two groups of two, the points in each gιoup being
                    taken in a definite order. Thus, let A, B be the first, C, D the second pair, A
                    and C being the first points in each pair. The cross-ratio is then the ratio AC:
                    CB divided by AD: DB. This will be denoted by (ABCD), so that (ABCD)≈^:^.</p>
                <p>This is easily remembered. In order to write it out, make first the two lines for
                    the fractions, and put above and below these</p>
                <p>A A</p>
                <p>the letters A and B in their places, thus, —g <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> ~jj î
                    and then fill up, crosswise, the first by C and the other by D.</p>
                <p>§ 15. If we take the points in a different order, the value of the cross-ratio
                    will change. We can do this in twenty-four different ways by forming all
                    permutations of the letters. But of these twenty-four cross-ratios groups of
                    four are equal, so that there are really only six different ones.</p>
                <p>We have the following rules :—</p>
                <p>I. If in a cross-ratio the two groups be interchanged, its value remains
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (CDAB).</p>
                <p>II. If in a cross-ratio the two points belonging to one of the two groups be
                    interchanged, the cross-ratio changes into its reciprocal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">(</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> abcd</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">)-(λ⅛C)∙</hi></p>
                <p>III. If in a cross-ratio the two middle letters be interchanged, the cross-ratio
                    <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> changes into its complement 1 - <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ.</hi></p>
                <p>(ABCD) = 1- (ACBD).</p>
                <p>The first two are easily proved by writing out their values. The third is proved
                    by aid of the formula (3), § 10,</p>
                <p>BC. AD + CA. BD + AB. CD = 0.</p>
                <p>If we divide this by CB . AD we get</p>
                <p>, CA. BD , AB . CD ~ <hi rend="superscript"> 1 +</hi> CB. AD <hi
                    rend="superscript"> +</hi> CB .AD~° ’ or,</p>

                <p>(ABCD) + (ACBD) = 1, which was 11 be proved.</p>
                <p>IV. From II. it follows at once that if we interchange the elements in each pair,
                    the cross-ratio remains unaltered; and thus we see that</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (CDAB) by I.</p>
                <p>= (BADC) = (DCBA) by II.</p>
                <p>§ 16. By aid of these rules we get the following results :— (ABCD) ≈ (BADC) =
                    (CDAB) - (DCBA) = <hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> ( ABDC) = ( B ACD) - (CDBA) =
                    (DCAB)=J.</p>
                <p>(ACBD) = (BDAC) = (CADB) = (DBCA) = 1 - <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi>.</p>
                <p>( ACDB) = ( BDCA) = (CABD) = (DB AC) =</p>
                <p>(ADBC) = (BCAD) ≈ (CBDA) = (DACB) = — - <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>.</p>
                <p>(ADCB) = (BCDA) = (CBAD) = (DABC) = ^−.</p>
                <p>In the theorem that the cross-ratio of four points equals that of 'the
                    projections, the points have, of course, to be taken in the sañie order.</p>
                <p>§ 17. If one of the points of which a cross-ratio is formed is the point at
                    infinity in the line, the cross-ratio changes into a simple ratio. It is
                    convenient to let the point at infinity occupy the last place in the symbolic
                    expression for the cross-ratio. Thus if 1 is a point at infinity, we have</p>
                <p>(ABCI)=-~, because</p>
                <p>AI:IB--1.</p>
                <p>Every common ratio of three points in a line may thus De expressed as a
                    cross-ratio, by adding the point at infinity to the group of points.</p>
                <p>§ 18. If the points have special positions, the cross-ratios <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ</hi> may have such a value that, of the six different ones, two and two
                    become equal. If the first two shall be equal, we get κ = ^&gt; °r κ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =l, κ=±l.</p>
                <p>AC AD</p>
                <p>If we take κ= +1, we have (ABCD) = 1, or ðB <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> DB
                    &gt; that <hi rend="superscript"> ιs</hi> &gt; the points C and D coincide,
                    provided that A and B are different. This is too special a case to be of much
                    interest.</p>
                <p>If, however, we take κ=-l, so that (ABCD)=-1, we have θβ= - ∙θβ . <hi

                <p>But we have also (CDAB) = -1, so that A and B are harmonic conjugates with regard
                    to C and D.</p>
                <p>The principal property of harmonic points, upon which almost all applications
                    depend, is this, that their cross-ratio remains unaltered if we interchange the
                    two points belonging to one pair, viz.:</p>
                <p>( ABCD) - (ABDC) - (BACD).</p>
                <p>For four harmonic points the six cross-ratios which are generally different
                    become two and two equal:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">κ=</hi>-1, l-κ = 2, jτy = i∙</p>
                <p>l- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,+= <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>,⅛</p>
                <p>Hence if we get four points whose cross-ratio is 2 or ⅜, then they are harmonic,
                    but not arranged so that conjugates are paired. If this is the case the
                    cross-ratio = —1.</p>
                <p>§ 19. If we equate any two of the above six values of the crossratios, we get
                    either κ = l, 0, ∞, or <hi rend="italic">κ=</hi>-1, 2, ⅛, or else <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> becomes a root of the equation <hi rend="italic">κ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >κ</hi> +1 = 0, that is, an imaginary cube root of - 1. In this case the six
                    values become three and three equal, so that only two different values remain.
                    This case, though important in the theory of cubic curves, is for our purposes
                    of no interest, whilst harmonic points are all-important.</p>
                <p>§ 20. From the definition of harmonic points, and by aid of §11, the following
                    properties are easily deduced.</p>
                <p>If C and D are harmonic conjugates with regard to A and B, then one of them lies
                    in, the other without AB; it is impossible to move from A to B without passing
                    either through C or through D; the one blocks the finite way, the other the way
                    through infinity. This is expressed by saying A and B are “separated” by C and
                    D.</p>
                <p>For every position of C there will be one and only one point D which is its
                    harmonic conjugate with regard to any point pair A, B.</p>
                <p>If A and B are different points, and if C coincides with A or B, D does. But if A
                    and B coincide, one of the points C or D, lying between them, coincides with
                    them, and the other may be anywhere in the line. It follows that, <hi
                    rend="italic">“if of four harmonic conjugates two coincide, then a third

                <p>If C is the middle point between A and B, then D is the point at infinity for

                <p>This important property gives a first example how metric properties are connected
                    with projective ones.</p>

                    lines in a plane is called a complete quadrilateral or, shorter, a four-side

                    where the sides meet, and three diagonals AB, EF, GH, which join <hi

                    hence = -1, as the four points are all different. This gives the important

                <p>§ 22. The theory of cross-ratios may be extended from points in a row to lines in
                    a flat pencil, and to planes in an axial pencil. We have seen (§ 13) that if the
                    lines which join four points A, B, C, D to any point S be cut by any other line
                    in A', B', C, D', then (ABCD) = (A'B'C'D'). In other words, four lines in a flat
                    pencil are cut by every other line in four points whose cross-ratio is
                    constant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> By the cross-ratio of four rays in a flat
                    pencil is meant the cross-ratio of the four points in which the rays are cut by
                    any line. If <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the
                    lines, then this cross-ratio is denoted, by <hi rend="italic">(abed).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> By the cross-ratio of four planes in an axial
                    pencil is understood the cross-ratio of the four points in which any line cuts

                    which any plane cuts the four planes.</p>
                <p>In order that this definition may have a meaning, it has to be proved that all
                    lines cut the pencil in points which have the same cross-ratio. This is seen at
                    once for two intersecting lines, as their plane cuts the axial pencil in a flat
                    pencil, which is itself cut by the two lines. The cross-ratio of the four points
                    on one line is therefore equal to that on the other, and equal to that of the
                    four rays in the flat pencil.</p>
                <p>If two non-intersecting lines <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>§ 23. We may now also extend the notion of harmonic elements, viz. :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definition.—</hi> Four rays in a flat pencil and four planes in
                    air axial pencil are said to be harmonic if their cross-ratio equals - 1, that

                <p>Harmonic pencils are constructed by aid of the theorem in § 21, which may now be
                    stated thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In a four-side two sides are harmonic conjugates with regard to

                    conjugates with regard to the sides passing through the first.</hi></p>
                <p>If we understand by a “median line” of a triangle a line which joins a vertex to
                    the middle point of the opposite side, and by a “median line” of a parallelogram
                    a line joining middle points of opposite sides, we get as special cases of the
                    last theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The diagonals and median lines of a parallelogram form an

                <p>This connects perpendicularity and bisection of angles with projective

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Correspondence.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 25. Two rows, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and p', which are one the projection of
                    the other (as in fig. 5), stand in a definite relation to each other,
                    characterized by the following properties.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">To each point in either corresponds one point in the

                    of one another.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The cross-ratio of any four points in one equals that of the

                <p>If we suppose corresponding points marked, and the rows brought into any other

                    longer; but we have still a <pb break="no"

                    possessing the first two properties. Such a correspondence has been called a <hi

                    such correspondence has been established are said to be <hi rend="italic"

                    such a position the rows are said to be in <hi rend="italic">perspective

                <p>§ 26. The notion of a one-one correspondence between rows may be extended to flat
                    and axial pencils, viz., a flat pencil will be said to be projective to a flat
                    pencil if to each ray in the first corresponds one ray in the second, and if the
                    cross-ratio of four rays in one equals that of the corresponding rays in the
                    second.</p>
                <p>Similarly an axial pencil may be projective to an axial pencil. But a flat pencil
                    may also be projective to an axial pencil, or either pencil may be projective to
                    a row. The definition is the same in each case: there is a one-one
                    correspondence between the elements, and four elements have the same cross-ratio
                    as the corresponding ones.</p>
                <p>§ 27. There is also in each case a special position which is called <hi
                    rend="italic">perspective,</hi> viz. :—</p>
                <p>1. Two projective rows are perspective if they lie in the same plane, and if the
                    one row is a projection of the other.</p>
                <p>2. Two projective flat pencils are perspective—(a) if they lie in the same plane,
                    and have a row as a common section; <hi rend="italic">(β)</hi> if they lie in
                    the same pencil (in space), and are both sections of the same axial pencil; (7)
                    if they are in space and have a row as common section, or are both sections of
                    the same axial pencil, one of the conditions involving the other.</p>
                <p>3. Two projective axial pencils, if their axes meet, and if they have a flat
                    pencil as a common section.</p>
                <p>4. A row and a projective flat pencil, if the row is a section of the pencil,
                    each point lying in its corresponding line.</p>
                <p>5. A row and a projective axial pencil, if the row is a section of the pencil,
                    each point lying in its corresponding line.</p>
                <p>6. A flat and a projective axial pencil, if the former is a section of the other,
                    each ray lying in its corresponding plane.</p>
                <p>That in each case the correspondence established by the position indicated is
                    such as has been called projective follows at once from the definition. It is
                    not so evident that the perspective position may always be obtained. We shall
                    show in § 30 this for the first three cases. First, however, we shall give a few
                    theorems which relate to the general correspondence, not to the perspective

                    common base but are not identical, not more than two elements in the one can
                    coincide with their corresponding elements in the other.</p>
                <p>Thus two projective rows on the same line cannot have more than two pairs of
                    coincident points unless every point coincides with its corresponding point.</p>
                <p>It is easy to construct two projective rows on the same line, which have two
                    pairs of corresponding points coincident. Let the points A, B, C as points
                    belonging to the one row correspond to A, B, and C' as points in the second.
                    Than A and B coincide with their corresponding points, but C does not. It is,
                    however, not necessary that two such rows have twice a point coincident with its
                    corresponding point; it is possible that this happens only once or not at all.
                    Of this we shall see plenty of examples as we go on.</p>
                <p>§ 35. If two projective rows or pencils are in perspective position, we know at
                    once which element in one corresponds to any given element in the other. If <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> (fig. 8) are two projective
                    rows, so that K corresponds to itself, and if we know that to A and B in <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> correspond A' and B' in <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> then the
                    point S, where AA' meets BB', is the centre of projection, and hence, in order
                    to find the point C <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> corresponding to C, we have
                    only to join C to S; the point C', where this line cuts <hi rend="italic"
                    >q,</hi> is the point required.</p>
                <p>If two flat pencils, S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, in a plane are perspective (fig. 9), we need only to know two pairs, <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> ’ and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> of corresponding rays in order
                    to find the axis s of projection. This being known, a ray c' in S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, corresponding <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n407/mode/1up"

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, is found by joining S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to
                    the point where <hi rend="italic">c</hi> cuts the axis s.</p>
                <p>Asimilar construction holds in the other casesof perspective figures. On this
                    depends the solution of the following general problem.</p>
                <p>§ 36. <hi rend="italic">Problem.—</hi> Three pairs of corresponding elements in
                    two projective rows or pencils being given, to determine for any element in one
                    the corresponding element in the other.</p>
                <p>We solve this in the two cases of two projective rows and of two projective flat
                    pencils in a plane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi> I.—Let A, B. C lie three <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in S the corresponding point D' in s'. the
                    corresponding ray d' in S'.</p>
                <p>The solution is made to depend on the construction of an auxiliary row or pencil
                    which is perspective to both the given ones. This is found as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Solution· of Problem</hi> I.—On the line joining two
                    corresponding points, say AA' (fig. 10), take any two points, S and S', as
                    centres of auxiliary pencils. Join the intersection B <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> of SB and S'B' to the intersection C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> of SC
                    and S'C ’ by the line s <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Then a row on s <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be perspective to s with S as centre of
                    projection, and to s' with S' as centre. To find now the point D' on s'
                    corresponding to a point D on s we have only to determine the point D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, where the line SD cuts s <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    and to draw S'D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; the point where this line cuts s'
                    will be the required point D'.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> The rows s and s' are both perspective to the row
                    s <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, hence they are projective to one another. To A,
                    B, C, D on s correspond A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>, D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ons <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and to these correspond A', B', C', D' on s'; so that
                    D and D' are corresponding points as required.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Solution of Problem</hi> II.—Through the intersection A of two
                    corresponding rays <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and α' (fig. 11), take two lines, s
                    and s', as bases of auxiliary rows. Let S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the
                    point where the line <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    l</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> which joins B and B', cuts the line <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi>
                    which joins C aud C'. Then a pencil S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be
                    perspective to S with <hi rend="italic">s</hi> as axis of projection. To find
                    the ray <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> in S' corresponding to a given ray <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> in S, cut <hi rend="italic">d</hi> by sat D; project this
                    point from S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to D' on s' and join D' to S'. This
                    will be the required ray.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> That the pencil S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is
                    perspective to S and also to S' follows from construction. To the lines α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="italic">, c</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> correspond the lines <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> in S and the lines α', <hi rend="italic">b',</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d, d'</hi> in S', so* that <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">d'</hi> are corresponding rays.</p>
                <p>In the first solution the two centres, S, S', are <hi rend="italic">any</hi> two
                    points on a line joining any two corresponding points, so that the solution of
                    the problem allows of a great many different constructions. <hi rend="italic"
                    >But whatever construction be used, the point D', corresponding to D, must be
                    always the same,</hi> according to the theorem in § 29. This gives rise to a
                    number of theorems, into which, however, we shall not enter. The same remarks
                    hold for the second problem.</p>
                <p>§ 37. As a further application of the theorems about perspective rows and pencils
                    we shall prove the following important theorem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> If ABC and A'B'C' (fig. 12) be two triangles,
                    such that the lines AA', BB', CC' meet in a point S, then the intersections of
                    BC and B'C', of CA and C'A', and of AB and A'B' will lie in a line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof. —</hi> Let <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> denote the lines AA', BB', CC <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, which meet at S. Then these may be taken as bases of
                    projective rows, so that A, A', S on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> correspond to B,
                    B', S on <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and to C, C', S on <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    As the point S is common to all, any two of these rows will be perspective.</p>
                <p>If S, be the centre of projection of rows <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c, S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,, ,, ,, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, then Λ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be corresponding

                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are perspective, therefore
                    the line A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, that is
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, joining

                    2</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> lie in a line. This is Desargues’s
                    celebrated theorem if we state it thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem of</hi><hi rend="italic">Desargues.</hi> —If each of
                    two triangles has one vertex on each of three concurrent lines, then the
                    intersections of corresponding sides lie in a line, those sides being called
                    corresponding which are opposite to vertices on the same line.</p>
                <p>The converse theorem holds also, viz.:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> If the sides of one triangle meet those of
                    another in three points which lie in a line, then the vertices lie on three
                    lines which meet in a point.</p>
                <p>The proof is almost the same as before.</p>
                <p>§ 38. <hi rend="italic">Metrical relations between projective rows.—</hi> Every

                    corresponds a point I' in the o"ther, and to the point J' at infinity in the
                    second corresponds a point J in the first. The points I' and J are in general
                    finite. If now A and B are any two points in the one, A', B' the corresponding

                <p>that is, corresponding segments are proportional. Conversely, if corresponding
                    segments are proportional, then to the point at infinity in one corresponds the

                    conversely, if two rows are similar then they are projective, and the points at
                    infinity are corresponding points.</p>
                <p>From this the well-known propositions follow :—</p>
                <p>Two lines are cut proportionally (in similar rows) by a series of parallels. The
                    rows arc perspective, with centre of projection at infinity.</p>
                <p>If two similar rows are placed parallel, then the lines joining homologous points
                    pass through a common point.</p>
                <p>§ 40. <hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> If two flat pencils be projective, then
                    there exists in either one single pair of lines at right angles to one another,

                    angles.</p>
                <p>To prove this, we place the pencils in perspective position (fig. 13) by making
                    one ray coincident with its corresponding ray. Corresponding rays meet then on a

                <p>§ 41. It has been stated in § 1 that not only points, but also planes and lines,
                    are taken as elements out of which figures are built up. We shall now see that
                    the construction of one figure which possesses certain properties gives rise in
                    many cases to the construction of another figure, by replacing, according to
                    definite rules, elements of one kind by those of another. The new figure thus
                    obtained will then possess properties which may be stated as soon as those of
                    the original figure are known.</p>
                <p>We obtain thus a principle, known as the <hi rend="italic">principle of

                    construct to any figure not containing any measurement in its construction a <hi
                    rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> figure, as it is called, and to deduce from any
                    theorem a <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> theorem, for which no further proof
                    is needed.</p>
                <p>It is convenient to print reciprocal propositions on opposite sides of a page
                    broken into two columns, and this plan will occasionally be adopted.</p>
                <p>We begin by repeating in this form a few of our former statements :—</p>
                <p>Two points determine a line. Two planes determine a line.</p>
                <p>Three points which are not in a Three planes which do not pass line determine a
                    plane. through a line determine a point.</p>
                <p>A line and a point without it deA line and a plane not through it termine a
                    plane. determine a point.</p>
                <p>Two lines in a plane determine a Two lines through a point deterpoint. mine a
                    plane.</p>
                <p>These propositions show that it will be possible, when any figure is given, to
                    construct a second figure by taking planes instead of points, and points instead
                    of planes, but lines where we had lines.</p>
                <p>For instance, if in the first figure we take a plane and three points in it, we
                    have to take in the second figure a point and three planes through it. Tlιe
                    three points in the first, together with the three lines joining them two and
                    two, form a triangle; the three planes in the second and their three lines of
                    intersection form a trihedral angle. A triangle and a trihedral angle are
                    therefore reciprocal figures.</p>
                <p>Similarly, to any figure in a plane consisting of points and lines will
                    correspond a figure consisting of planes and lines passing through a point S,
                    and hence belonging to the pencil which has S as centre.</p>
                <p>The figure reciprocal to four points in space which do not lie in a plane will
                    consist of four planes which do not meet in a point. In this case each figure
                    forms a tetrahedron.</p>
                <p>§ 42. As other examples we have the following :—</p>
                <p>To a row is reciprocal an axial pencil,</p>
                <p>„ a flat pencil „ a flat pencil,</p>
                <p>,, a field of points and lines „ a pencil of planes and lines,</p>
                <p>„ the space of points „ the space of planes.</p>
                <p>For the row consists of a line and all the points in it, reciprocal to it
                    therefore will be a line with all planes through it, that is, an axial pencil;
                    and so for the other cases.</p>
                <p>This correspondence of reciprocity breaks down, however, if we take figures which
                    contain measurement in their construction. For instance, there is no figure
                    reciprocal to two planes at <hi rend="italic">right angles,</hi> because there
                    is no segment in a row which has a magnitude as definite as a right angle.</p>
                <p>We add a few examples of reciprocal propositions which are easily proved.</p>

                <p>§ 43. Reciprocal figures as explained lie both in space of three dimensions. If
                    the one is confined to a plane (is formed of elements which lie in a plane),
                    then the reciprocal figure is confined to a pencil (is formed of elements which
                    pass through a point).</p>
                <p>But there is also a more special principle of duality, according to which figures
                    are reciprocal which lie both in a plane or both in a pencil. In the plane we
                    take points and lines as reciprocal elements, for they have this fundamental
                    property in common, that two elements of one kind determine one of the other. In
                    the pencil, on the other hand, lines and planes have to be taken as reciprocal,
                    and here it holds again that two lines or planes determine one plane or
                    line.</p>
                <p>Thus, to one plane figure we can construct one reciprocal figure in the plane,
                    and to each one reciprocal figure in a pencil. We mention a few of these. At
                    first we explain a few names :—</p>
                <p>A figure consisting of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> points in A figure consisting of
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines in a a plane will be called an n-point. plane
                    will be called an n-side.</p>
                <p>A figure consisting of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> planes in a A figure consisting
                    of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lines in a pencil will be called an n-flat. pencil
                    will be called an n-edge.</p>
                <p>It will be understood that an n-side is different from a polygon of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> sides. The latter has sides of finite length and <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> vertices, the former has sides all of infinite extension,
                    and every point where two of the sides meet will be a vertex; A similar
                    difference exists between a solid angle and an n-edge or an n-flat. We notice
                    particularly—</p>
                <p>A four-point has six sides, of which A four-side has six vertices, of two and two
                    are opposite, and three which two and two are opposite, diagonal points, which
                    are intersec-and three diagonals, which join tions of opposite sides. opposite
                    vertices.</p>
                <p>A four-flat has six edges, of which A four-edge has six faces, of which two and
                    two are opposite, aud three two and two are opposite, and three diagonal planes,
                    which pass through diagonal edges, which are intersecopposite edges. tions of
                    opposite faces.</p>
                <p>A four-side is usually called a complete quadrilateral. The above notation,
                    however, seems better adapted for the statement of reciprocal propositions.</p>

                <p>If a point moves in a plane it de-If a line moves in a plane it en-scribes a

                <p>A curve thus appears as generated either by points, and then we call it a
                    “locus,” or by lines, and then we call it an “envelope.” In the same manner a
                    cone, which means here a surface, appears either as the locus of lines passing
                    through a fixed point, the “vertex” of the cone, or as the envelope of planes
                    passing through the same point.</p>
                <p>To a surface as locus of points corresponds, in the same manner, a surface as
                    envelope of planes; and to a curve in space as locus of points corresponds a
                    developable surface as envelope of planes. Of the latter we shall not say any
                    more at present.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the above that we may, by aid of the principle of duality,
                    construct for every figure a reciprocal figure, and that to any property of the
                    one a reciprocal property of the other will exist, as long as we consider only
                    properties which depend upon nothing but the positions and intersections of the
                    different elements and not upon measurement.</p>
                <p>For suc∙lι propositions it will therefore be unnecessary to prove more than one
                    of two reciprocal theorems.</p>

                    state only very few. We point out, however, the following connexion between the

                <p>We prove the first. A curve of the second order is generated by two projective
                    pencils. These pencils, when joined to the point in space, give rise to two
                    projective axial pencils, which generate the cone in question as locus of the

                    similarly s'.</p>
                <p>It follows that every line in one of the two pencils cuts the curve in two
                    points, viz., once at the centre S of the pencil, and once where it cuts its
                    corresponding ray in the other pencil. These two points, however, coincide, if
                    the line is cut by its corresponding line at S itself. The line <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> in S, which corresponds to the line SS' in S', is therefore
                    the only line through S which has but one point in common with the curve, or
                    which cuts the curve in two <hi rend="italic">coincident</hi> points. Such a
                    line is called a tangent to the curve, touching the latter at the point S, which
                    is called the point of contact.</p>
                <p>In the same manner we get in the reciprocal investigation the result that through
                    every point in one of the rows, say in <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> two tangents
                    may be drawn to the curve, the one being <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> the other the
                    line joining the point to its corresponding point in <hi rend="italic">sl.</hi>
                    There is, however, one point P in s for which these two lines coincide. Such a
                    point in one of the tangents is called the “point of contact” of the tangent. We
                    thus get—</p>

                    of corresponding rays is determined. Of this curve we know the two centres S <hi

                    considerations enable us to solve the following two problems :—</p>

                    >Problem.</hi> —To construct a curve the second order, of which five of the

                <p>In order to solve the left-hand problem, we take two of the given points, say S
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, as centres of
                    pencils. These we make projective by taking the rays α <hi rend="subscript">

                    B, C respectively, so that three rays meet their corresponding rays at the given
                    points A, B, C. This determines the correspondence of the pencils which will
                    generate a curve of the second order passing through A, B, C and through the
                    centres S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, hence
                    through the five given points. To find more points on the curve we have to
                    construct for any ray in S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the corresponding ray in
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. This has been done in § 36. But we repeat the
                    con struction in order to deduce further properties from it. We also solve the
                    right-hand problem. Here we select two, viz., <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi

                    has just been shown, always draw a curve of the second order through them, we
                    select two of the points as centres of Erojective pencils, and then one such
                    curve is determined. It will e presently shown that we get always the same curve
                    if two other points are taken as centres of pencils, that therefore five points

                    second order, and reciprocally, that five tangents determine one curve of the
                    second class. Six points taken at random will therefore not lie on a curve of
                    the second order. In order that this may be the case a certain condition has to
                    be satisfied, and this condition is easily obtained from the construction in §
                    49, fig. 15. If we consider the conic determined by the five points A, S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, K, L, then the point D

                <p>Tliis may be stated differently if we take AKS <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> DS

                    will be KS <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> L, as
                    well as S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> D and LA. The first two meet in D <hi

                    respectively. We may therefore state the required condition, together with the
                    reciprocal one, as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pascal’s Theorem—It</hi> a hexagon <hi rend="italic"

                    opposite vertices are three lines meeting in a point.</p>
                <p>These celebrated theorems, which are known by the names of their discoverers, are
                    perhaps the most fruitful in the whole theory of conics. Before we go over to
                    their applications we have to show that we obtain the same curve if we take,
                    instead of S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, any
                    two other points on the curve as centres of projective pencils.</p>
                <p>§ 52. We know that the curve depends only upon the correspondence between the
                    pencils S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and
                    not upon the special construction used for finding new points on the curve. The
                    point A (fig. 15 or fig. 17), through which the two auxiliary rows <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    u,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> were drawn, may therefore be changed
                    to any other point on the curve. Let us now suppose the curve drawn, and keep
                    the points S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, K, L,
                    and D, and hence also the point S fixed, whilst we move A along the curve. Then
                    the line AL will describe a pencil about L as centre, and the point D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> a row on S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> D perspective
                    to the pencil L. At the same time AK describes a pencil about K and D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> a row perspective to it on S <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> D. But by Pascal’s Theorem D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ä</hi> will always lie in a line with S, so that the rows
                    described by D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and D <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    are perspective. It follows that the pencils K and L will themselves be
                    projective, corresponding rays meeting on the curve. This proves that we get the
                    same curve whatever pair of the five given points we take as centres of
                    projective pencils. Hence—</p>

                    lines.</p>
                <p>We have seen that if on a curve of the second order two points coincide at A, the
                    line joining them becomes the tangent at A. If, therefore, a point on the curve
                    and its tangent are given, this will be equivalent to having given two points on
                    the curve. Similarly, if on the curve of second class a tangent and its point of
                    contact are given, this will be equivalent to two given tangents.</p>

                <p>We have seen that a curve of second order, as generated by projective pencils,
                    has at the centre of each pencil one tangent; and further, that any point on the

                <p>§ 54. We return to Pascal’s and Brianchon’s theorems and their applications, and
                    shall, as before, state the results both for curves of the second order and
                    curves of the second class, but prove them only for the former.</p>
                <p>Pascal’s theorem may be used when five points are given to find more points on
                    the curve, viz., it enables us to find the point where any line through one of
                    the given points cuts the curve again. It is convenient, in making use of
                    Pascal’s theorem, to number the points, to indicate the order in which they are
                    to be taken in forming a hexagon, which, by the way, may be done in 60 different
                    ways. It will be seen that 1 2 and (leaving out 3) 4 5 are opposite sides, so
                    are 2 3 and (leaving out 4) 5 6, and also 3 4 and (leaving out 5) 6 1.</p>
                <p>If the points 1 2 3 4 5 are given, and we want a 6th point on a line drawn
                    through 1, we know all the sides of the hexagon with the exception of 5 6, and
                    this is found by Pascal’s theorem.</p>
                <p>If this line should happen to pass through 1, then 6 and 1 coincide, or the line
                    6 1 is the tangent at 1. And always if two consecutive vertices of the hexagon
                    approach nearer and nearer, then the side joining them will ultimately become a
                    tangent.</p>
                <p>We may therefore consider a pentagon inscribed in a curve of second order and the
                    tangent at one of its vertices as a hexagon, and thus get the theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.</hi> —Every pentagon in- <hi rend="italic"

                    contact of the opposite side.</p>

                <p>§ 55. Of these theorems, those about the quadrilateral give rise to a number of
                    others. Four points A, B, C, 1) may in three different ways be formed into a
                    quadrilateral, for we may take them in the order ABCD, or ACBD, or ACDB, so that
                    either of the points B, C, D may be taken as the vertex opposite to A.
                    Accordingly we may apply the theorem in three different ways.</p>
                <p>Let A, B, C, D be four points on a curve of second order (fig. 20), and let us
                    take them as forming a quadrilateral by taking the points in the order ABCD, so
                    that A, C and also B, D are pairs of opposite vertices. Then P, Q will be the
                    points where opposite sides meet, and E, F the intersections of tangents at
                    opposite vertices. The four points P, Q, E, F lie therefore in a line. The
                    quadrilateral ACBD gives us in the same way the four points Q, R, G, H in a
                    line, and the quadrilateral ABDC a line containing the four points R, P, I, K.
                    These three lines form a triangle PQR.</p>
                <p>The relation between the points and lines in this figure may be expressed more
                    clearly if we consider ABCD as a four-point inscribed in a conic, and the
                    tangent at these points as a four-side circumscribed about it,—viz., it will be
                    seen that P, Q, R are the diagonal points of the four-point ABCD, whilst the
                    sides of the triangle PQR are the diagonals of the circumscribing four-side.
                    Hence the theorem—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Any four-point on a curve of
                    the second order and the four-side formed by the tangents at these points stand
                    in this relation that the diagonal points of the four-point lie in the diagonals
                    of the four-side.</hi> And conversely, <hi rend="italic">If a four-point and a
                    circumscribed four-side stand in the above relation, then a curve of the second
                    order may be described which passes through the four points and touches there
                    the four sides of these figures.</hi></p>
                <p>That the last part of the theorem is true follows from the fact that the four
                    points A, B, C, D and the line <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> as tangent at A,
                    determine a curve of the second order, and the tangents to this curve at the
                    other points B, C, D are given by the construction which leads to fig. 20.</p>
                <p>The theorem reciprocal to the last is—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Any four-side circumscribed
                    about a curve of second class and the four-point formed by the points of contact

                    four-side and an inscribed four-point stand in the above relation, then a curve
                    of the second class may be described which touches the sides of the four-side at
                    the points of the four-points.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 56. The four-point aud the four-side in the two reciprocal theorems are alike.
                    Hence if we have a four-point ABCD and a four-side <hi rend="italic">abed</hi>
                    related in the manner described, then not only may a curve of the second order
                    be drawn, but also a curve of the second class, which both touch the lines <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> at the points A, B, C,
                    D.</p>
                <p>The curve of second order is already more than determined by the points A, B, C
                    and the tangents <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> at A, B, and C. The point D may therefore be <hi

                    tangent to the curve. On the other hand the curve of the second class is more
                    than determined by the three tangents <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> and their points of contact A, B, C, so that
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is any tangent to this curve. It follows that every
                    tangent to the curve of second order is a tangent of a curve of the second class
                    having the same point of contact. In other words, the curve of second order is a
                    curve of second class, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence the

                <p>The curves of second order and of second class having thus been proved to be

                <p>For these curves hold, therefore, all properties which have been proved for
                    curves of second order or of second class. We may therefore now state Pascal’s

                <p>§ 57. If we suppose in fig. 20 that the point D together with the tangent <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    remain fixed, then the ray DA will describe a pencil about A, the point Q a

                    >b,</hi> and the ray EF a pencil about E. But EF passes always through Q. Hence
                    the pencil described by AD is projective to the pencil described by EF, and

                <p>§ 59. We have not yet considered the shape of the conics. We know that any line
                    in the plane of the conic, and hence that the line at infinity, either has no
                    point in common with the curve, or one (counting for two coincident points), or
                    two distinct points. If the line at infinity has no point on the curve the
                    latter is altogether finite, and is called an <hi rend="italic">Ellipse</hi>
                    (fig. 20). If the line at infinity has only one point in common with the conic,
                    the latter extends to infinity, and has the line at infinity a tangent. It is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Parabola</hi> (fig. 21). If, lastly, the line at
                    infinity cuts the curve in two points, it consists of two separate parts which
                    each extend in two branches to the points at infinity were they meet. The curve
                    is in this case called an <hi rend="italic">Hyperbola</hi> (see fig. 19, 24, or
                    25). The tangents at the two points at infinity are finite because the line at

                    The branches of the hyperbola approach these lines indefinitely as a point on

                    standing upon the same arc are equal. If two points S <hi rend="subscript">

                    points A and B on the circle, then the angle included by the rays S <hi

                    and therefore projective pencils. The circle can thus be generated by two
                    projective pencils, and is a curve of the second order.</p>
                <p>If we join a point in space to all points on a circle, we get a (circular) cone
                    of the second order (§ 43). Every plane section of this cone is a conic. This
                    conic will be an ellipse, a parabola, or an hyperbola, according as the line at
                    infinity in the plane has no, one, or two points in common with the conic in
                    which the plane at infinity cuts the cone. It follows that our curves of second
                    order may be obtained as sections of a circular cone, and that they are
                    identical with the “Conic Sections” of the Greek mathematicians.</p>
                <p>§ 61. Any two tangents to a parabola are cut by all others in projective rows;
                    but the line at infinity being one of the tangents, the points at infinity on
                    the rows are corresponding points, and the rows therefore similar. Hence—</p>

                <p>§ 62. We return once again to the remarkable figure (fig. 20) which we obtained
                    in § 55.</p>
                <p>If a four-side be circumscribed about and a four-point inscribed in a conic, so
                    that the vertices of the second are the points of contact of the sides of the
                    first, then the triangle formed by the diagonals of the first is the same as
                    that formed by the diagonal points of the other.</p>
                <p>Such a triangle will be called a <hi rend="italic">polar triangle</hi> of the
                    conic, so that PQR in fig. 20 is a polar triangle. It has the property that on
                    the side <hi rend="italic">p</hi> opposite P meet the tangents at A and B, and
                    also those at C and D. From the harmonic properties of four-points and
                    four-sides it follows further that the points L, Μ, where it cuts the lines AB
                    and CD, are harmonic conjugates with regard to AB and CD respectively.</p>
                <p>If the point P is given, and we draw a line through it, cutting the conic in A
                    and B, then the point Q harmonic conjugate to P with regard to AB, and the point
                    H where the tangents at A and B meet, are determined. But they lie both on <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> and therefore this line is determined. If we now draw a
                    second line through P, cutting the conic in C and D, then the point Μ harmonic
                    conjugate to P with regard to CD, and the point G where the tangents at C and D
                    meet, must also lie on <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> As the first line through P
                    already determines <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the second may be any line through
                    P. Now every two lines through P determine a four-point ABCD on the conic, and

                <p>§ 63. To any point P in the plane of but not on a conic corresponds thus one line

                <p>The truth of 2 follows from 1. If T be a point where <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    cuts the conic, then one of the points where PT cuts the conic, and which are
                    harmonic conjugates with regard to PT, coincides with T; hence the other
                    does—that is, PT touches the curve at T.</p>
                <p>That 4 is true follows thus: If we draw from a point H on the polar one tangent
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to the conic, join its point of contact A to the pole
                    P, determine the second point of intersection B of this line with the conic, and
                    draw the tangent at B, it will pass through H, and will therefore be the second
                    tangent which may be drawn from H to the curve.</p>
                <p>§ 65. The second property of the polar or pole gives rise to the theorem—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> From a point in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theorem.—</hi> A line in the plane of a plane of a conic, two, one, or no

                    with the conic, according according as its polar has two, one, as two, one, or
                    no tangents can be or no points in common with the drawn from its pole to the

                <p>Of any point in the plane of a conic we say that it was <hi rend="italic"
                    >without, on,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the curve according as two,
                    one, or no tangents to the curve pass through it. The points on the conic
                    separate those within the conic from those without. That this is true for a
                    circle is known from elementary geometry. That it also holds for other conics
                    follows from the fact that every conic may be considered as the projection of a
                    circle, which will be proved later on.</p>
                <p>The fifth property of pole and polar stated in § 64 shows how to find the polar
                    of any point and the pole of any line by aid of the straight-edge only.
                    Practically it is often convenient to draw three secants through the pole, and
                    to determine only one of the diagonal points for two of the four-points formed
                    by pairs of these lines and the conic (fig. 21).</p>
                <p>These constructions also solve the problem :-—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem.—</hi> From a point without a conic, to draw the two
                    tangents to the conic by aid of the straight-edge only.</p>
                <p>For we need only draw the polar of the point in order to find the points of
                    contact.</p>
                <p>§ 66. The property of a polar-triangle may now be stated thus— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theorem.—</hi> In a polar-triangle each side is the polar of the opposite
                    vertex, and each vertex is the pole of the opposite side.</p>
                <p>If P is one vertex of a polar-triangle, then the other vertices, Q and R, lie on
                    the polar <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of P. One of these vertices we may chose
                    arbitrarily. For if from any point Q on the polar a secant be drawn cutting the
                    conic in A and D (fig. 22), and if the lines joining these points to P cut the
                    conic again at B and C, then the line BC will pass through Q. Hence P and Q are
                    two of the vertices on the polar-triangle which is determined by the four-point
                    ABCD. The third vertex R lies also on the line <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> It
                    follows, therefore, also—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If</hi> Q <hi rend="italic"

                    of</hi> q.</p>
                <p>This is a very important theorem. It may also be stated thus—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem.—</hi><hi rend="italic">If a point moves along a

                    rend="italic">pass through</hi><hi rend="italic">the pole of the row.</hi></p>
                <p>To prove the last part, let us suppose that P, A, and B in fig. 22 remain fixed,
                    whilst Q moves along the polar <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of P. This will <pb

                    B. Hence Q and R describe projective rows, and hence PR, which is the polar of
                    Q, describes a pencil projective to either.</p>
                <p>§ 67. Two points, of which one, and therefore each, lies on the polar of the
                    other, are said to be <hi rend="italic">conjugate with regard to the conic;</hi>
                    and two lines, of which one, and therefore each, passes through the pole of the
                    other, are said to be <hi rend="italic">conjugate with regard to the conic.</hi>
                    Hence all points conjugate to a point P lie on the polar of P; all lines
                    conjugate to a line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> pass through the pole of <hi
                    rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <p>If the line joining two conjugate poles cuts the conic, then the poles are
                    harmonic conjugates with regard to the points of intersection; hence one lies
                    within the other without the conic, and all points conjugate to a point within a
                    conic lie without it.</p>
                <p>Of a polar-triangle any two vertices are conjugate poles, any two sides conjugate
                    lines. If, therefore, one side cuts a conic, then oue of the two vertices which
                    lie on this side is within and the other without the conic. The vertex opposite
                    this side lies also without, for it is the pole of a line which cuts the curve.
                    In this case therefore one vertex lies within, the other two without. If, on the
                    other hand, we begin with a side which does not cut the conic, then its pole
                    lies within and the other vertices without. Hence—</p>

                <p>Let AA' and BB' (fig. 23) be one pair of conjugate diameters at right angles to
                    each other, CC' and DD' a second pair. If we draw through the end point A of one

                    DD', hence PA' is parallel to CC', and therefore PA and PA' are perpendicular.
                    If we further draw the tangents to the conic at A and A', these will be
                    perpendicular to AA', they being parallel to the conjugate diameter BB'. We know

                    and the point P. Through these a circle may be drawn having AA' as diameter; and

                <p>In a circle every diameter is an axis, every point on it is a vertex; and any two

                <p>If we describe on a diameter AB of an ellipse or hyperbola a circle concentric to
                    the conic, it will cut the latter in A and B (fig. 24). Each of the semicircles
                    in which it is divided by AB will be partly within, partly without the curve,
                    and must cut the latter therefore again in a point. The circle and the conic
                    have thus four points A, B, C, D, and therefore one polar-triangle, in common (§
                    68). Of this the centre is one vertex, for the line at infinity is the polar to
                    this point, both with regard to the circle and the other conic. The other two
                    sides are conjugate diameters of both, hence perpendicular to each other. This

                    with regard to the two tangents that may be drawn from P to the conic.</p>
                <p>If we take instead of P the centre C of an hyperbola, then the conjugate lines

                    requires measurement.</p>
                <p>§ 74. For the parabola, too, follow some metrical properties. A diameter PM (fig.
                    26) bisects every chord conjugate to it, and the pole P of such a chord BC lies
                    on the diameter. Buta diameter cuts the parabola once at infinity. Hence—</p>

                <p>§ 75. Two asymptotes and any two tangents to an hyperbola may be considered as a
                    quadrilateral circumscribed about the hyperbola. But in such a quadrilateral the
                    intersections of the diagonals and the points of contact of opposite sides lie
                    in a line (§ 54). If therefore DEFG (fig. 27) is such a quadrilateral, then the
                    diagonals DF and GE will meet on the line which joins the points of contact of
                    the asymptotes, that is, on the line at infinity; hence they are parallel. From
                    this the following theorem is a simplo deduction :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theorem.—</hi> All triangles formed by a tangent and the

                <p>If we draw at a point P (fig. 27) on an hyperbola a tangent, the part HK between
                    the asymptotes is bisected at P. The parallelogram PQOQ' formed by the
                    asymptotes and lines parallel to them through P will be half the triangle OHK,
                    and will therefore be constant. If we now take the asymptotes OX and OY as
                    oblique axes of coordinates, the lines OQ and QP will be the coordinates of P,
                    and will satisfy the equation <hi rend="italic">xy =</hi> const, =α <hi

                <p>It is not difficult to get the equations to the ellipse and hyperbola referred to

                <p>Proof. In order to determine the correspondence, we may assume three pairs of
                    corresponding points in two projective rows. Let then A', B <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, C', in fig. 29, correspond to A, B, C, so that A and
                    B', and also B and A', denote the same point. Let us further denote the point C
                    ’ when considered as a point in the first row by D; then it is to be proved that
                    the point D', which corresponds to D, is the same point as C. We kno∖v that the
                    cross-ratio of four points is equal to that of the corresponding row. Hence</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = (A'B'C'D')</p>
                <p>but replacing the dashed letters by those undashed ones which denote the same
                    points, the second cross-ratio equals (BADD'), which, according to § 15, iv.,
                    equals (ABD ’ D); so that the equation becomes</p>
                <p>(ABCD) = ( ABD'D).</p>
                <p>This requires that C and D' coincide.</p>
                <p>§ 77. Two projective rows on the same base, which have the above property, that
                    to every point, whether it be considered as a point in the one or in the other
                    row, corresponds the same point, are said to be in <hi rend="italic"

                <p>We mention, but without proving it, that any two projective rows may be placed so
                    as to form an involution.</p>
                <p>An involution may be said to consist of a row of pairs of points, to every point
                    A corresponding a point A', and to A' again the point A. These points are said
                    to be conjugate.</p>
                <p>From the definition, according to which an involution may be considered as made
                    up of two projective rows, follow at once the following important properties
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1.) The cross-ratio of four points equals that of the four conjugate points.</p>
                <p>(2.) If we call a point which coincides with its conjugate point a “focus” of the
                    involution, we may say: An involution has either two foci, or one, or none, and
                    is called respectively a hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic involution (§
                    34).</p>
                <p>(3.) In a hyperbolic involution any two conjugate points are harmonic conjugates
                    with regard to the two foci.</p>
                <p>For if A, A'be two conjugate points, F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> the two foci, then to the points F <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi>, F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A, A' in the one row correspond the
                    points F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A', A in
                    the other, each focus corresponding to itself. Hence (F <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> AA') = (F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> F
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A'A)—that is, we may interchange the two points AA'
                    without altering the value of the cross-ratio, which is the characteristic
                    property of harmonic conjugates (§ 18).</p>

                <p>(4.) The point conjugate to the point at infinity is called the “centre” of the
                    involution. Every involution has a centre, unless the point at infinity be a
                    focus, in which case we may say that the centre is at infinity.</p>
                <p>In a hyperbolic involution the centre is the middle point between the foci.</p>
                <p>(5.) The product of the distances of two conjugate points A, A' from the centre 0
                    is constant :—</p>
                <p>OA.OA'-c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proof.—</hi> Let A, A', and B, B' be two pairs of conjugate
                    points, 0 the centre, I the point at infinity, then</p>

                <p>OA. OA'= OB. OB'.</p>
                <p>In order to determine the distances of the foci from the centre, we write F for A

                <p>If c=0, OF = 0, and the two foci both coincide with the centre.</p>
                <p>If c is negative, √c becomes imaginary, and there are no foci. Hence we may

                <p>From these expressions it follows that conjugate points A, A' in a hyperbolic

                <p>In the first case, for instance, OA. OA' is positive; hence OA and OA' have the
                    same sign.</p>
                <p>It also follows that two segments, AA' and BB', between pairs of conjugate points
                    have the following positions:—in a hyperbolic involution they lie either one
                    altogether within or altogether without each other; in a parabolic involution
                    they have one point in common; and in an elliptic involution they overlap, each
                    being partly within and partly without the other.</p>

                    on the same side of ( ), and if B is nearer to 0 than A, so that OB&lt;OA, then
                    OB'≥OA'; hence B' lies further away from O than A', or the segment A A' lies

                <p>This property gives a simple means to construct, by aid of the straight edge
                    only, in an involution of which two pairs of conjugate points are given, to any
                    point its conjugate.</p>
                <p>§ 79. The theory of involution may at once be extended from the row to the flat
                    and. the axial pencil—viz., we say that there is an involution in a flat or in
                    an axial pencil if any line cuts the pencil in an involution of points. An
                    involution in a pencil consists of pairs of conjugate rays or planes; it has
                    two, one, or no <hi rend="italic">focal rays</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρ&gt;lanes,</hi> but nothing corresponding to a centre.</p>
                <p>An involution in a flat pencil contains always one, and in general only one, pair
                    of conjugate rays which are perpendicular to one another. For in two projective
                    flat pencils exist always two corresponding right angles (§ 40).</p>
                <p>Each involution in an axial pencil contains in the same manner one pair of
                    conjugate planes at right angles to one another.</p>
                <p>As a rule, there exists but one pair of conjugate lines or planes at right angles
                    to each other. But it is possible that there are more, and then there is an
                    infinite number of such pairs. An involution in a flat pencil, in which every
                    ray is perpendicular to its conjugate ray, is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >circular.</hi> That such involution is possible is easily seen thus:—if in two
                    concentric flat pencils each ray on one is made to correspond to that ray on the
                    other which is perpendicular to it, then the two pencils are projective, for if
                    we turn the one pencil through a right angle each ray in one coincides with its
                    corresponding ray in the other. But these two projective pencils are in

                    two segments AA' and BB' lie partly within partly without each other (fig. 31).
                    Hence two circles described on 'AA and BB' as diameters will intersect in two
                    points E and E'. The line EE' cuts the base of the involution at a point O,
                    which, from a well known proposition (Eucl.</p>
                <p>III. 35), has the property that OA,OA' = OB.OB', for each is equal to OE. OE'.
                    The point 0 is therefore the centre of tho involution. If we wish to construct
                    to any point C the conjugate point O', we may draw the circle through CEE'. This
                    will cut the base in the required point C' for OC.OC' = OA.OA'. But EC and EC'
                    are at right angles. Hence the involution which is obtained by joining E or E'
                    to the points in the given involution is circular. This may also be expressed

                <p>§ 81. By the aid of § 53, the points on a conic may be made to correspond to
                    those on a line, so that the row of points on the conic is projective to a row
                    of points on a line. We may also have two projective rows on the same conic, an$
                    these will be in involution as soon as one point on the conic has the same point
                    corresponding to it all the same to whatever row it belongs. An involution of
                    points on a conic will have the property (as follows from its definition, and
                    from § 53) that the lines which join conjugate points of the involution to any
                    point on the conic are conjugate lines of an involution in a pencil, and that a
                    fixed tangent is cut by the tangents at conjugate points on the conic in points
                    which are again conjugate points of an involution on the fixed tangent. For such
                    involution on a conic the following theorem holds :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem. —</hi><hi rend="italic">The lines which join
                    corresponding points in an involution on a conic all pass through a fixed

                    conjugate lines in an involution among tangents to a conic lie on a
                    line.</hi></p>
                <p>We prove the first part only. The involution is determined by two pairs of
                    conjugate points, say by A, A' and B, B' (fig. 32). Let AA' and BB' meet in P.
                    If we join the points in involution to any point on the conic, and the conjugate
                    points to another point on the conic, we obtain two projective pencils. We take
                    A and A ’ as centres of these pencils, so that the pencils A(A'BB') and A'(AB'B)
                    are projective, and in perspective position, because AA' corresponds to A'A.
                    Hence corresponding rays meet in a line, of which two points are found by
                    joining AB' to A'B and AB to A'B'. It follows that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >axis</hi> of perspective is the polar of the point P, where A A' and BB' meet.
                    If we now wish to construct to any other point C on the conic the corresponding
                    point C', we join C to A' and the point where this line cuts <hi rend="italic"
                    >y&gt;</hi> to A. The latter line cuts the conic again in C'. But we know from
                    the theory of pole and polar that the line CO' passes through P.</p>

                    corresponds to A'—in other words, the rows are in involution. The conjugate
                    points in this involution are conjugate points with regard to the conic.
                    Conjugate points coincide only if the polar of a point A passes through’ A—that

                <p>In other words—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A focus is such a point that every line through it is

                <p>The polar to a focus is called a <hi rend="italic">directrix</hi> of the
                    conic.</p>
                <p>From the definition it follows that :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Every focus lies on an axis,</hi> for the line joining a focus

                    for</hi> the perpendiculars to this line through the foci are conjugate to it.
                    These conjugate lines pass through the pole of the line, the pole lies therefore
                    at infinity, and the line is a diameter, hence by the last property an axis.</p>
                <p>It follows that all <hi rend="italic">foci lie on one axis,</hi> for no line

                <p>As the conic determines in the pencil which has its centre at a focus a circular
                    involution, no tangents can be drawn from the focus to the conic. Hence <hi

                    If the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is made to describe a pencil about a point
                    Q, then the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> will describe a pencil about P. These

                    >p</hi> through it, and from the pole of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> draw a
                    perpendicular <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> Let <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> cut the axis in Q. Then, in the pencils of conjugate lines,
                    which have their centres at P and Q, the lines <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> are conjugate lines at right angles to one another.
                    Besides, to the axis as a ray in either pencil will correspond in the other the
                    perpendicular to the axis (§ 72). The conic generated by the intersection of
                    corresponding lines in the two pencils is therefore the circle on PQ as
                    diameter, <hi rend="italic">so that every line in P is perpendicular to its
                    corresponding line in Q.</hi></p>
                <p>To every point P on an axis of a conic corresponds thus a point Q, such that
                    conjugate lines through P and Q are perpendicular.</p>
                <p>We shall show that these <hi rend="italic">pointpairs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >P,</hi><hi rend="italic">Q form an involution.</hi> To do this let us move P
                    along the axis, and with it the line <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> keeping the
                    latter parallel to itself. Then P describes a row, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> a
                    perspective pencil (of parallels), and the pole of 72 a projective row. At the
                    same time the line <hi rend="italic">q</hi> describes a pencil of parallels
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and perspective to the row formed by
                    the pole of <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> The point Q, therefore, where <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> cuts the axis, describes a row projective to the row of
                    points P. The two points P and Q describe thus two projective rows on the axis;
                    and not only does P as a point in the first now correspond to Q, but also Q as a
                    point in the first corresponds to P. The two rows therefore form an involution.
                    <hi rend="italic">The centre of this involution, it is easily seen, is the
                    centre of the conic.</hi><hi rend="italic">A focus of this involution has the
                    property that any two conjugate lines through it are perpendicular; hence, it is
                    a focus to the conic.</hi></p>
                <p>Such involution exists on each axis. But only one of these can have foci, because
                    all foci lie on the same axis. The involution on one of the axis is elliptic,
                    and appears (§ 80) therefore as the section of two circular involutions in two
                    pencils whose centres lie in the other axis. These centres are foci, hence the
                    one axis contains two foci, the other axis none; <hi rend="italic">or every
                    central conic has two foci which lie on one axis equidistant from the
                    centre.</hi></p>
                <p>The axis which contains the foci is called the <hi rend="italic">principal
                    axis</hi>; in case of an hyperbola it is the axis which cuts the curve, because
                    the foci lie within the conic.</p>
                <p>In case of the parabola there is but one axis. The involution on this axis has
                    its centre at infinity. One focus is therefore at infinity, the one focus only
                    is finite. <hi rend="italic">A parabola has only one focus.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 85. If through any point P (fig. 33) on a conic the tangent PT and the normal
                    PN (t. <hi rend="italic">e.,</hi> the perpendicular to the tangent through the
                    point of contact) be drawn, these will be conjugate lines with regard to the
                    conic, and at right angles to each other.</p>

                <p>They will therefore cut the principal axis in two points, which are conjugate in
                    the involution considered in § 84; hence they are harmonic conjugates with
                    regard to the foci. If therefore the two foci F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and
                    F <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be joined to P, these lines will be harmonic with
                    regard to the tangent and normal. As the latter are perpendicular, they will
                    bisect the angles between the other pair. Hence—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The line joining any point on a conic to the two foci
                    are</hi><hi rend="italic">eqτuιlly</hi><hi rend="italic">inclined to the tangent
                    and normal at that point.</hi></p>
                <p>In case of the parabola this becomes—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The line joining any point on a parabola to the focus and the
                    diameter through the point, are equally inclined to the tangent and normal at
                    that point.</hi></p>
                <p>From the definition of a focus it follows that—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The segment of a tangent between the directrix and the point of
                    contact is seen from the focus belonging to the directrix under a right
                    angle,</hi> because the lines joining the focus to the ends of this segment are
                    conjugate with regard to the conic, and therefore perpendicular.</p>
                <p>With equal ease the following theorem is proved :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The two lines which join the points of contact of two tangents
                    each to one focus, but not both to the same, are seen from the intersection of
                    the tangents under equal angles.</hi></p>
                <p>§. 86. Other focal properties of a conic are obtained by the following
                    considerations :—</p>
                <p>Let F (fig. 34) be a focus to a conic, <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the corresponding
                    directrix, A and B the points of contact of two tangents meeting at T, and P the
                    point where the line AB cuts the directrix. Then TF will be the polar of P
                    (because polars of F and T meet at P). Hence TF</p>
                <p>and PF are conjugate lines through a focus, and therefore perpendicular. They are
                    further harmonic conjugates with regard to FA andFB (§§ 64 and 13), so that they
                    bisect the angles formed by these lines. This by the way proves—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The segments between the point of intersection of two tangents
                    to a conic and their points of contact are seen from a focus under equal
                    angles.</hi></p>
                <p>If we next draw through A and B lines parallel to TF, then the points A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> where these cut the
                    directrix will be harmonic conjugates with regard to P and the point where FT
                    cuts the directrix. The lines FT and FP bisect therefore also the angles between
                    FΛ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and FB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. From this
                    it follows easily that the triangles FAA <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> and FBB
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are equiangular, and therefore similar, so that</p>
                <p>FA: AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = FB: BB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.</p>
                <p>The triangles AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> and
                    BB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> formed by drawing
                    perpendiculars from A and B to the directrix are also similar, so that AA <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>: BB <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,</p>
                <p>This, combined with the above proportion, gives</p>
                <p>FA: AA <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =FB: BB <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Hence the theorem:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The ratio of the distances of any point on a conic from a focus
                    and the corresponding directrix is constant.</hi></p>
                <p>To determine this ratio we consider its value for a vertex on the principal axis.
                    In an ellipse the focus lies between the two vertices on this axis, hence the
                    focus is nearer to a vertex than to the corresponding directrix. Similarly in an
                    hyperbola a vertex is nearer to the directrix than to the focus. In a parabola
                    the vertex lies halfway between directrix and focus.</p>
                <p>It follows in an ellipse the ratio between the distance of a point from the focus
                    to that from the directrix is less than unity, in the parabola it equals unity,
                    and in the hyperbola it is greater than unity.</p>
                <p>It is here the same which focus we take, because the two foci lie symmetrical to
                    the axis of the conic. If now P is any point on the conic having the distances r

                <p>If we call the distances of a point on a conic from the focus its focal distances
                    we have the theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In an ellipse the sum of the focal distances is constant; and

                <p>§ 87. Through four points A, B, C, D in a plane, of which no three lie in a line,
                    an infinite number of conics may be drawn, viz., through these four points and
                    any fifth one single conic. <hi rend="italic">This system of conics is called a
                    pencil of conics.</hi> Similarly all conics touching four fixed lines form a
                    system such that any fifth tangent determines one and only one conic. We have
                    here the theorems :—</p>

                <p>We prove the first theorem only. Let ABCD (fig. 35) be the four-point, then any

                    E,E', the pair AD, BC in points F,F', and any conic of the system in M,N, and we

                <p>But this is, according to § 77 (7), the condition that M, N are corresponding

                <p>The problem of drawing a conic through four points and touching a given line is
                    solved by determining the points of contact on the line, that is, by determining
                    the foci of the involution in which the line cuts the sides of the four-point.
                    The corresponding remark holds for the problem of drawing the conics which touch
                    four lines and pass through a given point.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ruled Quadric Surfaces.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 89. Formerly we have considered projective rows which lie in the same plane. In
                    that case, lines joining corresponding points envelope a, conic. We shall now
                    consider projective rows whose bases do not meet. In this case, corresponding
                    points will be joined by lines which do not he in a plane, but on some surface,
                    which like every surface generated by lines is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >ruled</hi> surface. This surface clearly contains the bases of the two
                    rows.</p>
                <p>If the points in either row be joined to the base of the other, we obtain two
                    axial pencils which are also projective, those planes being corresponding which

                <p>If we cut the whole figure by a plane this will cut the axial pencils in two
                    projective flat pencils, and the curve of the second order generated by these

                    the surface can therefore be generated by projective axial pencils.</p>

                <p>§ 91. The conics, the cones of the second order, and the ruled quadric surfaces
                    complete the figures which can be generated by projective rows or flat and axial
                    pencils, that is, by those aggregates of elements which are of one dimension (§§
                    5, 6). We shall now consider the simpler figures which are generated by
                    aggregates of two dimensions. The space at our disposal will not, however, allow
                    us to do more than indicate a few of the results.</p>
                <p>§ 92. We establish a correspondence between the lines and planes in pencils in
                    space, or reciprocally between the points and lines in two or more planes, but
                    consider principally pencils.</p>
                <p>In two pencils we may either make planes correspond to planes and lines to lines,
                    or else planes to lines and lines to planes. If hereby the condition be
                    satisfied that to a flat, or axial, pencil corresponds in the first case a
                    projective flat, or axial, pencil, and in the second a projective axial, or
                    flat, pencil, the pencils are said to be <hi rend="italic">projective</hi> in
                    the first case and <hi rend="italic">reciprocal</hi> in the second.</p>
                <p>For instance, two pencils which join two points S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to the different points and lines in a given
                    plane π are projective (and in perspective position), if those lines and planes
                    be taken as corresponding which meet the plane τr in the same point or in the
                    same line. In this case every plane through both centres S <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> of the two pencils will correspond to
                    itself. If these pencils are brought into any other position they will be
                    projective (but not perspective).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The correspondence between two projective pencils is uniquely

                    and this correspondence is determined. Hence, the plane <hi rend="italic"

                    determined. Similarly the plane <hi rend="italic">b'e'</hi> may be found and

                <p>Similarly the correspondence between two reciprocal pencils is determined if for
                    four rays in the one the corresponding planes in the other are given.</p>
                <p>§ 93. We may now combine—</p>
                <p>1. Two reciprocal pencils.</p>
                <p>Each ray cuts its corresponding plane in a point, the locus of these points is a

                <p>2. Two projective pencils.</p>
                <p>Each plane cuts its corresponding plane in a line, but a ray as a rule does not
                    cut its corresponding ray. The locus of points where a ray cuts its
                    corresponding ray is a twisted cubic. The lines where a plane cuts its

                <p>Of these we consider only the first two eases.</p>
                <p>§ 94. If two pencils are reciprocal, then to a plane in either corresponds a line

                <p>To prove this we consider any line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in space.</p>
                <p>The flat pencil in Si which lies in the plane drawn through <hi rend="italic"

                    determine onp two projective rows, and those points in these which coincide with

                    the latter ease the line lies altogether on the surface.</p>
                <p>This proves also that a plane cuts the surface in a curve of the second order, as
                    no line can have more than two points in common with it. To show that this is a
                    curve of the same kind as those considered before, λve have to show that it can
                    be generated by projective flat pencils. We prove first that this is true for
                    any plane through the centre of one of the pencils, and afterwards that every
                    point on the surface may be taken as the centre of such pencil. Let then α <hi

                    the flat pencil in S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which it contains corresponds

                    and this cuts α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in a second flat pencil. These two

                    neither concentric nor perspective. They generate therefore a conic. But if the

                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the pencils will have S <hi rend="subscript">

                    with their corresponding lines. The section of the surface by the plane α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be accordingly a line-pair or a single line, or
                    else the plane α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will have only the point S <hi

                    the surface generated by them is identical with Φ. To do this we draw two planes

                    These conics meet at S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and at some other point T

                    generate a quadric surface Φ', which passes through the point S and through the
                    two conics α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>The two surfaces Φ and Φ' have therefore the points S and S <hi rend="subscript">
                    j</hi> and the conics α <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> in common. To show that they are
                    identical, we draw a plane through S and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, cutting
                    each of the conics α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> in two points, which will always be
                    possible. This plane cuts Φ and Φ' in two conics which have the point S and the
                    points where it cuts α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> in common, that is five points in
                    all. The conics therefore coincide.</p>
                <p>This proves that all those points P on Φ' lie on Φ which have the property that
                    the plane SS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P cuts the conics α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    1</hi> in two points each. If the plane SS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P has
                    not this property, then we dιaw a plane SS <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> P. This
                    cuts each surface in a conic, and these conics have in common the points S, S
                    <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>, one point on each of the conics α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    l</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and one point on one of the conics through S and
                    S., which lie on both surfaces, hence five points. They are therefore
                    coincident, and our theorem is proved.</p>
                <p>§ 96. The following propositions follow :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A quadric surface has at every point a tangent</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pilane.</hi><hi rend="italic">Every plane section of a quadric
                    surface is a conic or a line-pair.</hi><hi rend="italic">Every line which has

                    rend="italic">Every conic which has five points in common with a quadric surface
                    lies on the surface.</hi><hi rend="italic">Through two conics zvhich lie in
                    differentplanes, but have two points in common, and through one external point
                    always one quadric surface may be drawn.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 97. <hi rend="italic">Every plane which cuts a quadric surface in a line pair
                    is a tangent plane.</hi> For every line in this plane through the centre of the
                    line-pair (the point of intersection of the two lines) cuts the surface in two
                    coincident points and is therefore a tangent to the surface, <hi rend="italic"
                    >the centre of the line-pair being the point of contact</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi><hi rend="italic">If a quadric surface contains a line, then every plane
                    through this line cuts the surface in a line-pair (or in two coincident
                    lines').</hi> For this plane cannot cut the surface in a conic. Hence <hi
                    rend="italic">If a quadric surface contains one line</hi> p <hi rend="italic"
                    >then it contains an infinite number of lines, and through every point</hi> Q
                    <hi rend="italic">on the surface, one line</hi> q can <hi rend="italic">be drawn
                    which cuts</hi> p. For the plane through the point Q and the linep cuts the
                    surface in a line-pair which must pass through Q and of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> is one line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">No two such lines</hi> q <hi rend="italic">on the surface can
                    meet.</hi> For as both meet <hi rend="italic">p</hi> their plane would contain
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and therefore cut the surface in a triangle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Every line which cuts three lines</hi> q <hi rend="italic">will
                    be on the surface;</hi> for it has three points in common with it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hence the quadric surfaces which contain lines are the same as
                    the ruled quadric surfaces considered in</hi> §§ 89-93, but with one important
                    exception. In the last investigation we have left out of consideration the
                    possibility of a plane having only one line (two coincident lines) in common
                    with a quadric surface.</p>
                <p>§ 98. To investigate this case we suppose first that there is one point A on the
                    surface through which two different lines <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> can be
                    drawn, which lie altogether on the surface.</p>
                <p>If P is any other point on the surface which lies neither on <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then the plane through P and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> will cut the surface in a second line <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> ’ wlιich passes through P and which cuts <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>
                    Similarly there is a line <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ’ through P which cuts <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> These two lines α' and <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">may</hi> coincide, but then
                    they must coincide with PA.</p>
                <p>If this happens for one point P, it happens for every other point Q. For if two
                    different lines could be drawn through Q, then by the same reasoning the line PQ
                    would be altogether on the surface, hence two lines would be drawn through P
                    against the assumption. From this follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If there is one point on a quadric surface through which one,
                    but only one, line can be drawn on the surface, then through every point one
                    line can be drawn, and all these lines meet in a point. The surface is a cone of
                    the second order.</hi><hi rend="italic">If through one point on</hi><hi

                    then through every point two lines may be drawn, and the surface is a ruled
                    quadric surface.</hi><hi rend="italic">If through one point on a quadric surface
                    no line on the surface can be drawn, then the surface contains no
                    lines.</hi></p>
                <p>Using the definitions at the end of § 95, we may also say :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On a quadric surface the points are all hyperbolic, or all
                    parabolic, or all elliptic.</hi></p>
                <p>As an example of a quadric surface with elliptical points, we mention the sphere
                    which may be generated by two reciprocal pencils, where to each line in one
                    corresponds the plane perpendicular to it in the other.</p>
                <p>§ 99. <hi rend="italic">Poles and Polar Planes.—</hi> The theory of poles and
                    polars with regard to a conic is easily extended to quadric surfaces.</p>
                <p>Let P be a point in space not on the surface, which we suppose not to be a cone.
                    On every line through P which cuts the surface in two points we determine the
                    harmonic conjugate Q of P with regard to the points of intersection. Through one
                    of these lines we draw two planes <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β.</hi> The locus of the points Q in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a line <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the polar of P with regard to the conic in which <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> cuts the surface. Similarly the locus of points Q in <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi> is a line <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This cuts <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> because the line of intersection of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> contains but one point Q. The locus of all
                    points Q therefore is a plane. <hi rend="italic">This plane is called the polar
                    plane of the point</hi> P, <hi rend="italic">with regard to the quadric surface.
                    If</hi> P <hi rend="italic">lies on the surface zee take the tangent plane
                    of</hi> P as <hi rend="italic">its polar.</hi></p>
                <p>The following propositions hold :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Every point has a polar plane,</hi> which is constructed by
                    drawing the polars of the point with regard to the conics in which two planes
                    through the point cut the surface.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> Q <hi rend="italic">is a point in the polar of</hi>
                    P, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> P <hi rend="italic">is a point in the polar
                    of</hi> Q, because this is true with regard to the conic in which a plane
                    through PQ cuts the surface.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Every plane is the</hi><hi rend="italic">pιolar</hi><hi

                <p>The pole to a plane is found by constructing the polar planes of three points in
                    the plane. Their intersection will be the pole.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The points in which the polar plane of</hi> P <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are made projective, then to a ray in one corresponds a
                    ray in the other, to a plane a plane, to a flat or axial pencil a projective
                    flat or axial pencil, and so on.</p>
                <p>There is a double infinite number of lines in a pencil. We shall see that a
                    single infinite number of lines in one pencil meets its corresponding ray, and
                    that the points of intersection form a curve in space.</p>
                <p>Of the double infinite number of planes in the pencils each will meet its
                    corresponding plane. This gives a system of a double infinite number of lines in
                    space. We know (§ 5) that there is a quadruple infinite number of lines in
                    space. From among these we may select those which satisfy one or more given
                    conditions. The systems of lines thus obtained was first systematically
                    investigated and classified by Pliicker, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometrie</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Raumes.</hi> He uses
                    the following names:—</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">treble infinite</hi> number of lines, that is, all lines
                    which satisfy one condition, are said to form a <hi rend="italic">complex, of

                    lines touching a surface.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">double infinite</hi> number of lines, that is, all lines
                    which satisfy two conditions, or which are common to two complexes, are said to
                    form a <hi rend="italic">congruence of lines;</hi><hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi>
                    all lines in a plane, or all lines cutting two curves, or all lines cutting a
                    given curve twice.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">single, infinite</hi> number of lines, that is, all lines
                    which satisfy three conditions, or which belong to three complexes, form a <hi

                <p>It follows that all lines in which corresponding planes in two projective pencils
                    meet form a congruence. We shall see this congruence consists of all lines which
                    cut a twisted cubic twice, or of all <hi rend="italic">secants</hi> to a twisted

                <p>If, however, the rays β <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> are secants meeting at A, then the
                    ruled quadric surface becomes a cone of the second order, having A as centre. Or
                    <hi rend="italic">all lines of the congruence which pass through a point on the

                    other words, the projection of a twisted cubic from any point in the curve on to

                <p>If α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is not a secant, but made to pass through any

                    > 1</hi> will pass through Q. <hi rend="italic">There will therefore bè one line
                    of the</hi><hi rend="italic">congruence</hi><hi rend="italic">passing
                    through</hi> Q, <hi rend="italic">and only one.</hi> For if two such lines pass
                    through Q, then the lines S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Q and S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Q will be corresponding lines; hence Q will be a point
                    on the cubic <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and an infinite number of secants will
                    pass through it. Hence :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Through every point in space not on the twisted cubic one and
                    only one secant to the cubic can be drawn.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 104. The fact that all the secants through a point on the cubic form a quadric
                    cone shows that the centres of the projective pencils generating the cubic are
                    not distinguished from any other points on the cubic. If we take any two points
                    S, S' on the cubic, and draw the secants through each of them, we obtain two
                    quadric cones, which have the line SS' in common, and which intersect besides
                    along the cubic. If we make these two pencils having S and S' as centres
                    projective by taking four rays on the one cone as corresponding to the four rays
                    on the other which meet the first on the cubic, the correspondence is
                    determined. These two pencils will generate a cubic, and the two cones of
                    secants having S and S' as centres will be identical with the above cones, for
                    each has five rays in common with one of the first, viz., the line SS' and the
                    four lines determined for the correspondence; therefore these two cones
                    intersect in the original cubic. This gives the theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On a hoisted cubic any two points may be taken as centres of
                    projective pencils</hi><hi rend="italic">ιvhich</hi><hi rend="italic">generate
                    the cubic, corresiìonding planes being those which meet on the same

                <p>Of the two projective pencils at S and S' we may keep the first fixed, and move
                    the centre of the other along the curve. The pencils will hereby remain
                    projective, and a plane <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in S will be cut by its
                    corresponding plane α' always in the same secant <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>

                <p>In this article we have given a purely geometrical theory of conics, cones of the
                    second order, quadric surfaces, &amp;c. In doing so we have followed, to a great
                    extent, Reye’s <hi rend="italic">Geometrie der Lage,</hi> and to this excellent

                <p>It will have been observed that scarcely any use has been made of algebra, and it
                    would have been even possible to avoid this little, as is done by Reye. There
                    are, however, other systems of geometry which start more or less from theorems
                    known to the Greeks, "and using more or less algebra.</p>

                <p>This will be here treated as a method. The science is Geometry; and it would be
                    possible, analytically, or by the method of coordinates, to develop the trutlιs
                    of geometry in a systematic course. But it is proposed not in any way to attempt
                    this, but simply to explain the method, giving such examples, interesting (it
                    may be) in themselves, as are suitable for showing how the method is employed in
                    the demonstration and solution of theorems or problems.</p>
                <p>Geometry is one-, two-, or three-dimensional, or, what is the same thing, it is
                    lineal, plane, or solid, according as the space dealt with is the line, the
                    plane, or ordinary (three-dimensional) space. No more general view of the
                    subject need here be taken :—but in a certain sense one-dimensional geometry
                    does not exist, inasmuch as the geometrical constructions for points in a line
                    can only be performed by travelling out of the line into other parts of a plane
                    which contains it, and conformably to the usual practice Analytical Geometry
                    will be treated under the two divisions, Plane and Solid.</p>
                <p>It is proposed to consider Cartesian coordinates almost exclusively; for the
                    proper development of the science homogeneous coordinates (three and four in
                    plane and solid geometry respectively) are required; and it is moreover
                    necessary to have the correlative line-and planecoordinates; and in solid
                    geometry to have the <hi rend="italic">six</hi> coordinates of the line. The
                    most comprehensive English works are those of Dr Salmon, <hi rend="italic">Th e

                <p>1. It is assumed that the points, lines, and figures considered exist in one and
                    the same plane, which plane, therefore, need not be in any way referred to. The
                    position of a point is determined by means of its (Cartesian) coordinates; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as explained under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Curve,</hi> we take the two lines <hi rend="italic">x'0x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y'Oy,</hi> called the axes of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> respectively, intersecting in a point 0 called the origin,

                    OM (or NP), and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = MP (or ON).</p>
                <p>The two axes are usually (as in fig. 1) at right angles to each other, and the
                    lines PM, PN are then at right angles to the axes of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> respectively. Assuming a scale at pleasure, the
                    coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> of a point have numerical values.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to attend to the signs: <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has opposite

                <p>A point is said to have the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(a, b),</hi> and is
                    referred to as the point <hi rend="italic">(a,</hi> δ), when its coordinates are
                    <hi rend="italic">x = a, y≈b∙&gt;</hi> the coordinates <hi rend="italic">x,
                    y</hi> of a variable point, or of a point which is for the time being regarded
                    as variable, are said to be current coordinates.</p>
                <p>2. It is sometimes convenient to use oblique coordinates; the only difference is
                    that the axes are not at right angles to each other; the lines PM, PN are drawn
                    parallel to the axes of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    respectively, and the figure OMPN is thus a parallelogram. But in all that
                    follows the Cartesian coordinates are taken to be rectangular; polar coordinates
                    and other systems will be briefly referred to in the sequel</p>
                <p>3. If the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> of a point are not
                    given, but only a relation between them <hi rend="italic">f(x,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">y)</hi> = 0, then we have a curve. For, if we consider <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> as a real quantity varying continuously from - oo to + oo ,
                    then, for any given value of <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> has a value or values.
                    If these are all imaginary, there is not any real point; but if one or more of
                    them be real, we have a real point or points, which (as the assumed value of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> varies continuously) varies or vary continuously therewith;
                    and the locus of all these real points is a curve. The equation completely
                    defines the curve; to trace the curve directly from the equation, nothing else
                    being known, we obtain as above a series of points sufficiently near to each
                    other, and draw the curve through them. For instance, let this be done in a
                    simple case. Suppose <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">= 2x</hi>- I; it
                    is quite easy to obtain and lay down a series of points as near to each other as
                    we please, and the application of a ruler would show that these were in a line;
                    that the curve is a line depends upon something more than the equation itself,
                    viz., the theorem that every equation of the form <hi rend="italic">y = ax +
                    b</hi> represents a line; supposing this known, it will be at once understood
                    how the process of tracing the curve may be abbreviated; we have <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> = 0, <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi>- 1,
                    and <hi rend="italic">x —</hi><hi rend="italic">⅜,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    = 0; the curve is thus the line passing through these two points. But in the
                    foregoing example the notion of a line is taken to be a known one, and such
                    notion of a line does in fact precede the consideration of any equation of a
                    curve whatever, since the notion of the coordinates themselves rests upon that
                    of a line. In other cases it may very well be that the equation is the
                    definition of the curve; the points laid down, although (as finite in number)
                    they do not actually determine the curve, determine it to any degree of
                    accuracy; and the equation thus enables us to construct the curve.</p>
                <p>A curve may be determined in another way; viz., the coordinates <hi rend="italic"
                    >x, y</hi> may be given each of them as a function of the same variable
                    parameter <hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi rend="italic">; x,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >y=foθ),</hi> ≠(6) respectively. Here, giving to <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> any
                    number of values in succession, these equations determine the values of <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi><hi rend="italic">ιfo</hi> that is, the positions of a
                    series of points on the curve. The ordinary form <hi rend="italic">y =
                    φ(x),</hi> where <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is given explicitly as a function of
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> is a particular case of each of the other two forms:
                    we have <hi rend="italic">fox,</hi><hi rend="italic">y),≈yφ(fo)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> θ5 aud <hi rend="italic"

                    φ(shfi</hi></p>
                <p>4. As remarked under <hi rend="smallcaps">Curve,</hi> it is a useful exercise to
                    trace a considerable number of curves, first taking equations which are purely
                    numerical, and then equations which contain literal constants (representing
                    numbers); the equations most easily dealt with are those wherein one coordinate
                    is given as an explicit function of the other, say <hi rend="italic">y =
                    φ(x)</hi> as above. A few examples are here given, with such explanations as
                    seem proper.</p>

                    determine the line.</p>

                    >x</hi>: the curve passes through the origin, and through the points (±1, 1). It
                    is ah eady known that the curve lies wholly above the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x.</hi> To find its form in the neighbourhood of the origin, give <hi

                    respectively; this shows that the curve touches the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> at the origin. Moreover, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> may be as large as we
                    please, but when it is large, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is much larger; for
                    instance, z = 10, y = 100. The curve is a parabola (fig. 2).</p>

                    at the origin, but it is a tangent of a peculiar kind (a stationary or
                    inflexional tangent), cutting the curve at the origin, which is an inflexion.
                    The curve is the cubical parabola (fig. 3).</p>

                    where it cuts the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> cuts H at right angles. It
                    may be further remarked that, as <hi rend="italic">x</hi> increases from 4, the

                    its form, but not in a very marked manner, and it retains the two inflexions.
                    The oval lies always between the values <hi rend="italic">x≈c,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">x=b,</hi> and therefore its length continually diminishes; it is
                    easy to see that its breadth will also continually diminish; ultimately it
                    shrinks up into a mere point. The curve has thus a conjugate or isolated point,
                    or acnode. For a direct verification observe that <hi rend="italic">x≈c,</hi><hi

                    which begins at <hi rend="italic">x≈a.</hi> The consideration of a few numerical
                    examples, <hi rend="italic">with careful drawing,</hi> would show that the oval
                    and the infinite branch as they approach sharpen out each towards the other (the
                    two inflexions on the infinite branch coming always nearer to the point (α, 0)

                <p>5. It may be remarked that the purely algebraical process, which is in fact that
                    employed in finding a differential coefficient , if applied directly to the
                    equation of the curve, determines the point consecutive to any given point of
                    the curve, that is, the direction of the curve at such given point, or, what is
                    the same tliing, the direction of the tangent at that point. In fact, if α, <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi> are the coordinates of any point on a curve <hi
                    rend="italic">fox,</hi><hi rend="italic">y) = 0,</hi> then writing in the
                    equation of the curve <hi rend="italic">x = a + h, y = β + k,</hi> and in the
                    resulting equation ∕(α + 7i, <hi rend="italic">β</hi> + ⅛) = 0 (developed in
                    powers of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and ⅛), omitting the term ∕(α, /3), which
                    vanishes, and the terms containing the second and higher powers of <hi
                    rend="italic">h, k,</hi> we have a linear equation <hi rend="italic">Åh</hi> +

                    k.</hi> Of course, in the analytical development of the theory, we translate
                    this into the notation of the differential calculus; but the question presents
                    itself, and is thus seen to be solvable, as soon as it is attempted to trace a
                    curve from its equation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geometry is Descriptive, or Metrical.</hi></p>
                <p>6. A geometrical proposition is either <hi rend="italic">descriptive</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">metrical</hi>: in the former case it is altogether independent of
                    the idea of magnitude (length, inclination, &amp;c.); in the latter case it has
                    reference to this idea. It is to be noticed that, although the method of
                    coordinates seems to be by its inception essentially metrical, and we can
                    hardly, except by metrical considerations, connect an equation with the curve
                    which it represents (for instance, even assuming it to be known that an equation
                    Az + By + C = 0 represents a line, yet if it be asked what line, the only form
                    of answer is, that it is the line cutting <pb break="no"

                    the origin - C÷A, -C÷B respectively), yet in dealing by this method with
                    descriptive propositions, we are, in fact, eminently free from all metrical
                    considerations.</p>
                <p>7. It is worth while to illustrate this by the instance of the well-known theorem
                    of the radical centre of three circles. The theorem is that, given any three
                    circles A, B, C (fig. 8), the common chords αα', <hi rend="italic">ββ&gt;
                    Tf'</hi> of the three pairs of circles meet in a point.</p>
                <p>The geometrical proof is metrical throughout :—</p>
                <p>Take 0 the point of intersection of αα', <hi rend="italic">ββ',</hi> and joining
                    this with γ', suppose that 7'O does not pass through 7, but that it meets the
                    circles A, B in two distinct points 7 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, 7 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> respectively. We have then the knoλvn metrical property
                    of intersecting chords of a circle; viz., in circle C where αα', <hi
                    rend="italic">ββ'</hi> are chords meeting at a point 0,</p>
                <p>0α.0α' = 0j8.0j8', where, as well as in what immediate follows 0α, &amp;c.,
                    denote, of course, <hi rend="italic">lengths</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >distances.</hi></p>
                <p>Similarly in circle A,</p>
                <p>0 <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> 8.0j3'-0γι∙0y, and in circle B, 0α. 0α' = 0γ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.0γ'.</p>
                <p>Consequently 0γ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.0γ' = 0γ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>.0γ', that is, 0γ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 0γ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, or the points γ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and γ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> coincide; that is, they each coincide with 7.</p>
                <p>We contrast this with the analytical method :—</p>
                <p>Here it only requires to be known that an equation <hi rend="italic">kx</hi> + By
                    + C = 0 represents a line, and an equation x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >+</hi><hi rend="italic">kx</hi> + By + C = 0 represents a circle. A, B, C have,
                    in the two cases respectively, metrical significations; but these we are not
                    concerned with. Using S to denote the function x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    + y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Ax + By+C, the equation of a circle is S =
                    0, where S stands for its value; more briefly, we say the equation is S, = <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi

                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi> A⅛ + B'y + C ’ = 0; the equation
                    S-S'=O is a linear equation (S-S ’ is in fact = (A-A') z + (B-B') y + G-C'), and
                    it thus represents a fine; this equation is satisfied by the coordinates of each
                    of the points of intersection of the two circles (for at each of these points S
                    = 0 and S ’ =0, therefore also S-S'≈≈O); hence the equation S-S'=∙O is that of
                    the line joining the two points of intersection of the two circles, or say it is
                    the equation of the common chord of the two circles. Considering then a third
                    circle S", — ae <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    k!'x</hi> + B''y + C" = 0, the equations of the common chords are S-S'=O,
                    S-S"=O, S'-S"-*O (each of these a linear equation); at the intersection of the
                    first and second of these lines S≈=S' and S = S", therefore also S'=S", or the
                    equation of the third line is satisfied by the coordinates of the point in
                    question; that is, the three chords intersect in a point 0, the coordinates of
                    whiβh are determined by the equations S = S' = S".</p>
                <p>It further appears that if the two circles S = 0, S = 0' do not intersect in any
                    real points, they must be regarded as intersecting in two imaginary points, such
                    that the line joining them is the real line represented by the equation S - S' =
                    0; or that two circles, whether their intersections be real or imaginary, have
                    always a real common chord (or radical axis), and that for <hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> three circles the common chords intersect in a point (of course real)
                    which is the radical centre. And by this very theorem, given two circles with
                    imaginary intersections, we can, by drawing circles which meet each of them in
                    real points, construct the radical axis of the first-mentioned two circles.</p>
                <p>8. The principle employed in showing that the equation of the common chord of two
                    circles is S - S' = 0 is one of very extensive application, and some more
                    illustrations of it may be given.</p>
                <p>Suppose S=-0, S'=0 are lines (that is, let S, S' now denote linear functions <hi
                    rend="italic">kx + By+C,</hi> A⅛ + B'y + C'), then S-fcS'=O (⅛ an arbitrary
                    constant) is the equation of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> line passing through the
                    point of intersection of the two given lines. Such a line may be made to pass
                    through any given point, say the point (a ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">),</hi> then the value of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is Zr=S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ÷S' <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>. The equation in
                    factis SS' <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>-S <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> S'=O; and
                    starting from this equation we at once verify it <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori</hi>; the equation is a linear equation satisfied by the values of
                    (ae, <hi rend="italic">y)</hi> which make S —0, S'=0; and satisfied also by the
                    values (a ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, 1∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>); and
                    it is thus the equation of the line in question.</p>
                <p>If, as before, S = 0, S' = 0 represent circles, then <hi rend="italic">(Jc</hi>
                    being arbitrary) S-Ä S' = 0 is the equation of any circle passing through the
                    two points of intersection of the two circles; and to make this pass through a
                    given point (α∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, y <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>) we
                    have again fc=S <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> ÷S' <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>.
                    In the particular case Ä=l, the circle becomes the common chord (more
                    accurately, it becomes the common chord together with the line infinity, but
                    this is a question which is not here gone into).</p>

                <p>Returning to the equation Az + By + C = 0 of a line, if this pass through two

                <p>9. The object still being to illustrate the mode of working with coordinates, we
                    consider the theorem of the polar of a point in regard to a circle. Given a
                    circle and a point 0 (fig. 9), we draw through 0 any two lines meeting the
                    circle in the points A, A' and B, B' respectively, and then taking Q as the
                    intersection of the lines AB' and A'B, the theorem is that the locus of the
                    point Q is a right line depending only upon 0 and the circle, but independent of
                    the particular lines OAA' and OBB'.</p>
                <p>Taking 0 as the origin, and for the axes any two lines through O at right angles

                    thence appears that the line Arr + By + C = 0 just obtained is in fact the line
                    joining the point Q with the point R which is the intersection of AB and
                    A'B'.</p>
                <p>10. The equation Az + By + C = 0 of a line contains in appearance 3, but really
                    only 2 constants (for one of the constants can be divided out), and a line
                    depends accordingly upon 2 parameters, or can be made to satisfy 2 conditions.
                    Similarly, the equation (a, <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">g,</hi><hi

                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> = 0 of a cubic contains really 9 constants. It thus
                    appears that a cubic can be made to pass through 9 given points, and that the
                    cubic so passing through 9 given points is completely determined. There is,
                    however, a remarkable exception. Considering two given cubic curves S = 0, S' =
                    0, these intersect in 9 points, and through these 9 points we have the whole
                    series of cubics S - &amp;S' = 0, where <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is an arbitrary
                    constant: <hi rend="italic">k</hi> may be determined so that the cubic shall
                    pass through a given tenth point (/¢ = S <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> ÷ S' <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi>, if the coordinates are <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> w</hi> y <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>), and S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi>, S' <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> denote the
                    corresponding values of 8, S'). The resulting curve SS' <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi>- S'S <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> = 0 may be regarded as the cubic
                    determined by the conditions of passing through 8 of the 9 points and through
                    the given point (r <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, y <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi>); and from the equation it thence appears that the curve passes through
                    the remaining one of the 9 points. In other words, we thus have the theorem, any
                    cubic curve which passes through 8 of the 9 intersections of two given cubic
                    curves passes through the 9th intersection.</p>
                <p>The applications of this theorem are very numerous; for instance, we derive from
                    it Pascal’s theorem of the inscribed hexagon. Consider a hexagon inscribed in a
                    conic. The three alternate sides constitute a cubic, and the other three
                    alternate sides another cubic. The cubics intersect in 9 points, being the 6
                    vertices of the hexagon, and the 3 Pascalian points, or intersections of the
                    pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon. Drawing a line through two of the
                    Pascalian points, the conic and this line constitute a cubic passing through 8
                    of the 9 points of intersection, and it therefore passes through the . remaining
                    point of intersection—that is, the third Pascalian point; and since obviously
                    this does not lie on the conic, it must lie on the line—that is, we have the
                    theorem that the three Pascalian points (or points of intersection of the pairs
                    of opposite sides) lie on a line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metrical Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>11. The foundation of the metrical theory consists in the simple theorem that if
                    a finite line PQ (fig. 10) be projected upon any other line OO' by lines
                    perpendicular to OO', then the length of the projection P'Q' is equal to the
                    length of PQ into the cosine of its inclination to P'Q'; or, what is the same
                    thing, that the perpendicular distance P'Q' of any two parallel lines is equal
                    to the inclined distance PQ into the cosine of the inclination. It at once
                    follows that the algebraical sum of the projections of the sides of a closed
                    polygon upon any line is = 0; or, reversing the signs of certain sides, and
                    considering the polygon as consisting of two broken lines, each extending from
                    the same initial to the same terminal point, the sum of the projections of the
                    lines of the first set upon any line is equal to the sum of the projections of
                    the lines of the second set. Observe that if any line be perpendicular to the
                    line on which the projection is made, then its projection is = 0.</p>
                <p>Thus, if we have a right-angled triangle PQR (fig. 11), where QR, RP, QP are =

                    the baseangle is = α, then projecting successively on the three sides, we

                <p>ξ = p cosα, <hi rend="italic">∙η = p</hi> sinα, ρ = ξ cosa + rç sin a; and we

                <p>And again, by projecting on a line Qaq, inclined at the angle « to QR, we have p

                <p>From either form it appears that the equation of a line is, in fact, a linear
                    equation of the form Az + By + C = 0. It is important to notice that, starting
                    from this equation, we can determine conversely the α but not the (a, <hi
                    rend="italic">b)</hi> of the form of equation which contains these quantities;
                    and in like manner the α' but not the (a, <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> of the other form of equation. The reason is obvious. In
                    each case <hi rend="italic">(a, b)</hi> denote the coordinates of a point, fixed
                    indeed, but which is in the first form any point of the line, and in the second
                    form any point whatever. Thus, in the second form the point from which the
                    perpendicular is let fall may be the origin. Here (a, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b)</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi> (0, 0), and the equation is <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> cosα' + y sina'-j5 = 0. Comparing this with <hi rend="italic">Ax</hi> +
                    By + C = 0, we have the values of cos α', sin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi

                    rend="italic">(a, b)</hi> are the zy-coordinates of the new origin Q <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and α is the inclination of Qz <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Ox.</hi> It is to be noticed that Qz <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, Qy <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are so placed that, by
                    moving 0 to Q, and then turning the axes Oz <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, Oy <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> round Q (through an angle α measured in the sense Oz to
                    Oy), the original axes <hi rend="italic">Ox, Oy</hi> will come to coincide with
                    Q- <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> υ Qy <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    respectively. This could not have been done if Qy <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    had been drawn (at right angles always to Qz <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) in
                    the reverse direction, we should then have had in the formulae -y <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> instead of y <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The new
                    formulae which would be thus obtained are of an essentially distinct form: the
                    analytical test is that in the formulae as written down we can, by giving to α a
                    proper value (in fact α = 0), make the (z-α) and <hi rend="italic">(y-b)</hi>
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> and y <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> respectively; in the other system we could only make
                    them equal to <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> respectively. But for the very reason that the second
                    system can be so easily derived from the first, it is proper to attend
                    exclusively to the first system,—that is, always to take the new axes so that
                    the two sets admit of being brought into coincidence.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing system of two pairs of equations, the first pair give the

                    original coordinates of the new origin; it would be easy instead of these to

                    rend="italic">, b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> χ</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    difficulty.</p>

                <p>16. As an instance of the mode of using the formulae, take the problem of finding
                    the locus of a point such that its distance from a given point is in a given
                    ratio to its distance from a given line.</p>
                <p>We take <hi rend="italic">(a, b)</hi> as the coordinates of the given point, and
                    it is convenient to take <hi rend="italic">(x, y)</hi> as the coordinates of the

                    other letters, sny (X, Y), for current coordinates in the equation of the given
                    line. Suppose this is a line such that its perpendicular distance from the

                    which is in fact that of the last example: the curve is the locus of a point
                    such that its distance from a given point (called the focus) is in a given ratio
                    to its distance from a given line (called the directrix); taking the ratio as e:
                    1, then <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is called the eccentricity.</p>

                <p>23. The position of a point may be determined by means of its distance from a
                    fixed point and the inclination of this distance to a fixed line through the
                    fixed point. Say we have <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the distance from the origin,
                    and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the inclination of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> to the
                    axis of <hi rend="italic">x; r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> are then the
                    polar coordinates of the point, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius vector, and
                    <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the inclination. These are immediately connected with
                    the Cartesian coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> by the formulae <hi

                    and the transition from either set of coordinates to the other can thus be made
                    without difficulty. But the use of polar coordinates is very convenient, as well
                    in reference to certain classes of questions relating to curves of any kind—for
                    instance, in the dynamics of central forces—as in relation to curves having in

                <p>24. Consider a fixed triangle ABC, and (regarding the sides as indefinite lines)
                    suppose for a moment that <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    denote the distances of a point P from the sides BC, CA, AB respectively,—these
                    distances being measured either perpendicularly to the several sides, or each of
                    them in a given direction. To fix the ideas each distance may be considered as
                    positive for a point inside the triangle, and the sign is thus fixed for any
                    point whatever. There is then an identical relation between <hi rend="italic">p,
                    q,</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>: if <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> are the lengths of the sides, and the distances
                    are measured perpendicularly thereto, the relation is <hi rend="italic">ap + bq
                    + cr =</hi> twice the <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi>,area of triangle. But taking
                    <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> proportional to <hi
                    rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> or if we please proportional to given multiples of
                    <hi rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> then only the ratios of <hi rend="italic">x,
                    y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> are determined; their absolute values remain
                    arbitrary. But the ratios of <hi rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> and consequently
                    also the ratios of <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi>
                    determine, and that uniquely, the point; and it being understood that only the
                    ratios are attended to, we say that (z, <hi rend="italic">y, z)</hi> are the
                    coordinates of the point. The equation of a line has thus the form <hi
                    rend="italic">ax + by + cz =</hi> 0, and generally that of a curve of the nth
                    order is a homogeneous equation of this order between the coordinates, ( * §z,
                    <hi rend="italic">y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z)</hi><hi rend="italic

                    coordinates is in the greater symmetry of the analytical forms, and in the more
                    convenient treatment of the line infinity and of points at infinity. The method
                    includes that of Cartesian coordinates, the homogeneous equation in <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> is in fact an equation in — ,
                    -, í√ <hi rend="italic">z</hi> which two quantities may be regarded as denoting

                    <hi rend="italic">z==</hi> 1. It may be added that if the trilinear coordinates
                    (z, <hi rend="italic">y, z)</hi> are regarded as the Cartesian coordinates of a
                    point of space, then the equation is that of a cone having the origin for its
                    vertex; and conversely that such equation of a cone may be regarded as the
                    equation in trilinear coordinates of a plane curve.</p>

                <p>25. All the coordinates considered thus far are pointcoordinates. More generally,
                    any two quantities (or the ratios of three quantities) serving to determine the
                    position of a point in the plane may be regarded as the coordinates of the
                    point; or, if instead of a single point they determine a system of two or more
                    points, then as the coordinates of the system of points. But, as noticed under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Curve,</hi> there are also line-coordinates serving to
                    determine the position of a line; the ordinary case is when the line is
                    determined by means of the ratios of three quantities <hi rend="italic">ξ, η,
                    ζ</hi> (correlative to the trilinear coordinates z, <hi rend="italic">y,

                    then the system of lines such that the coordinates of each of them satisfy this
                    relation, in fact, all the lines which pass through a given point; and it is
                    thus regarded as the line-equation of this point; and generally a homogeneous
                    equation ( * <hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fyξ,η,ζ)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> = 0 represents the curve
                    which is the envelope of all the lines the coordinates of which satisfy this

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Solid Analytical Geometry</hi> (§§26-40).</p>
                <p>26. We are here concerned with points in space,—the position of a point being
                    determined by its three coordinates z, <hi rend="italic">y, z.</hi> We consider
                    three coordinate planes, at right angles to each other, dividing the whole of
                    space into eight portions called octants, the coordinates of a point being the
                    perpendicular distances of the point from the three planes respectively, each
                    distance being considered as positive or negative according as it lies on the
                    one or the other side of the plane. Thus the coordinates in the eight octants
                    have respectively the signs</p>
                <p>The positive parts of the axes are usually drawn as in fig. 16, which represents
                    a point P, the coordinates of which have the positive values OM, MN, NP.</p>
                <p>27. It may be remarked, as regards the delineation of such solid figures, that if
                    we have in space three lines at right angles to each other, say Oα, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ob, Oc,</hi> of equal lengths, then it is possible to project
                    these by parallel lines upon a plane in such wise that the projections <hi
                    rend="italic">Oa',</hi><hi rend="italic">Ob',</hi> Oc' shall be at given
                    inclinations to each other, and that these lengths shall be to each other in
                    given ratios: in particular the two lines Oct', Oc' may be at right angles to
                    each other, and their lengths equal, the direction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ob',</hi> and its proportion to the two equal lengths Oα', Oc' being arbitrary.
                    It thus appears that we may as in the figure draw Oz, <hi rend="italic">Oz</hi>
                    at right angles to each other, and <hi rend="italic">Oy</hi> in an arbitrary
                    direction; and moreover represent the coordinates <hi rend="italic">x,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> on equal scales, and the remaining coordinate <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> on an arbitrary scale (which may be that of the other two
                    coordinates z, <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> but is in practice usually smaller).
                    The advantage, of course, is that a figure in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the
                    coordinate planes <hi rend="italic">xz</hi> is represented in its proper form
                    without distortion; but it may be in some cases preferable to employ the
                    isometrical projection, wherein the three axes are represented by lines inclined
                    to each other at angles of 120°, and the scales for the coordinates are equal
                    (fig. 17).</p>
                <p>For the delineation of a surface of a tolerably simple form, it is frequently
                    sufficient to draw (according to the foregoing projection) the sections by the
                    coordinate planes; and in particularwhen the surface is symmetrical in regard to
                    the coordinate planes, it is sufficient to draw the quartersections belonging to
                    a single octant of the surface; thus fig. 18 is a' convenient representation of
                    an octant of the wave surface. Or a surface may be delineated by means of a
                    series of parallel sections, or (taking these to be the sections by a series of
                    horizontal planes) say by a series of contour lines. Of course, other sections
                    may be drawn or indicated, if necessary. For the delineation of a curve, a
                    convenient method is to represent, as above, a series of the points P thereof,
                    each point P being accompanied by the ordinates PN, which serves to refer the
                    point to the plane of <hi rend="italic">xy</hi>; this is in effect a
                    representation of each point P of the curve, by means of two points P, N such
                    that the line PN has a fixed direction. Both as regards curves and surfaces, the
                    employment of stereographic representations is very interesting.</p>

                <p>28. In plane geometry, reckoning the line as a curve of the first order, we have
                    only the point and the curve. In solid geometry, reckoning a line as a curve of
                    the first order, and the plane as a surface of the first order, we have the
                    point, the curve, and the surface; but the increase of complexity is far greater
                    that would hence at first sight appear. In plane geometry a curve is considered
                    in connexion with lines (its tangents); hut in solid geometry the curve is
                    considered in connexion with lines and planes (its tangents and osculating
                    planes), and the surface also in connexion with lines and planes (its tangent
                    lines and tangent planes); there are surfaces arising out of the line—cones,
                    skew surfaces, developables, doubly and triply infinite systems of lines, and
                    whole classes of theories which have nothing analogous to them in plane
                    geometry: it is thus a very small part indeed of the subject which can be even
                    referred to in the present article.</p>
                <p>In the case of a surface we have between the coordinates <hi rend="italic">(x, y,
                    z)</hi> a single, or say a onefold relation, which can be represented by a
                    single relation <hi rend="italic">fox, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z) = 0</hi>; or
                    we may consider the coordinates expressed each of them as a given function of
                    two variable parameters <hi rend="italic">p,</hi><hi rend="italic">q</hi>; the
                    form <hi rend="italic">zπ=</hi><hi rend="italic">fox, y)</hi> is a particular
                    case of each of these modes of representation; in other words, we have in the
                    first mode <hi rend="italic">f (x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z) = zf(x,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">y),</hi> and in the second mode <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=p, y-q</hi> for the expression of two of the coordinates in terms
                    of the parameters.</p>
                <p>In the case of a curve we have between the coordinates (z, <hi rend="italic">y,
                    z)</hi> a twofold relation: two equations <hi rend="italic">fox, y, z)</hi> = 0,
                    <hi rend="italic">φ(x,</hi><hi rend="italic">y,</hi> z) = 0 give such a
                    relation; <hi rend="italic">τ.e,,</hi> the curve is here considered as the
                    intersection of two surfaces (but the curve is not always the complete
                    intersection of two sur-faoes, and there are hence difficulties); or, again, the
                    coordinates may be given each of them as a function of a single variable
                    parameter. The form <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">φχ,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi><hi rend="italic">= ψx,</hi> where
                    two of the coordinates are given in terms of the third, is a particular case of
                    each of these modes of representation.</p>
                <p>29. The remarks under plane geometry as to descriptive and metrical propositions,
                    and as to the non-metrical character of the method of coordinates when used for
                    the proof of a descriptive proposition, apply also to solid geometry; and they
                    might be illustrated in like manner by the instance of the theorem of the
                    radical centre of four spheres. The proof is obtained from the consideration
                    that S and S' being each of them a function of the form <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+ y</hi><hi

                    S-S' is a mere linear function of the coordinates, and consequently that S - S'
                    = 0 is the equation of the plane containing the circle of intersection of the
                    two spheres S = 0 and S' = 0.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metrical Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>30. The foundation in solid geometry of the metrical theory is in fact the
                    before-mentioned theorem that if a finite right line PQ be projected upon any
                    other line 00' by lines perpendicular to OO', then the length of the projection
                    P'Q' is equal to the length of PQ into the cosine of its inclination to P'Q'—or
                    (in the form in which it is now convenient to state the theorem) the
                    perpendicular distance P'Q' of two parallel planes is equal to the inclined
                    distance PQ into the cosine of the inclination. Hence also the algebraical sum
                    of the projections of the sides of a closed polygon upon any line is = 0; or,
                    reversing the signs of certain sides and considering the polygon as made up of
                    two broken lines each extending from the same initial to the same terminal
                    point, the sum of the projections of the one set of lines upon any line is equal
                    to the sum of the projections of the other set of lines upon the same line. When
                    any of the lines are at right angles to the given line’ (or, what is the same
                    thing, in a plane at right angles to the given line) the projections of these
                    lines severally vanish.</p>
                <p>31. Consider the skew quadrilateral QMNP, the sides QM, MN, NP being respectively
                    parallel to the three rectangular axes <hi rend="italic">Ox, Oy,</hi> Oz; let
                    the lengths of these sides be <hi rend="italic">ξ, η, ζ,</hi> and that of the
                    side QP be = <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi>; and let the cosines of the inclinations

                    be α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi><hi rend="italic">y,</hi> then projecting

                    rend="italic">ξ, η, ζ</hi> upon three rectangular axes. And from the same
                    equations we obtain <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">+ β</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi

                    three rectangular axes.</p>
                <p>Suppose we have through Q any other line QT, and let the cosine-inclinations of
                    this to the axes be α', <hi rend="italic">β',</hi><hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi> and
                    δ be its cosine-inclination to QP; also let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the
                    length of the projection of QP upon QT; then projecting on QT we have <hi

                <p>And in the last equation substituting for <hi rend="italic">ξ, η,</hi> ſ their

                <p>Considering any curve (of double curvature) whatever, the tangent lines of the

                    consecutive line of the system,—that is, they form a developable, or torse; the
                    curve and torse are thus inseparably connected together, forming a single
                    geometrical figure. A plane through three consecutive points of the curve (or
                    osculating plane of the curve) contains two consecutive tangents, that is, two
                    consecutive lines of the torse, and is thus a tangent plane of the torse along a
                    generating line.</p>

                <p>The hyperbolic paraboloid is such (and it is easy from the figure to understand
                    how this may be the case) that there exist upon it two singly infinite series of
                    right lines. The same is the case with the hyperboloid of one sheet (ruled or
                    skew hyperboloid, as with reference to this property it is termed). If we
                    imagine two equal and parallel circular disks, their points connected by strings
                    of equal length, so that these are the generating lines of a right circular
                    cylinder, then by turning one of the disks about its centre through the same
                    angle in one or the other direction, the strings will in each case generate one
                    and. the same hyperboloid, and will in regard to it be the two systems of lines
                    on the surface, or say the two systems of generating lines; and the general
                    configuration is the same when instead of circles we have ellipses. It has been
                    already shown analytically that the equation-^ + ' <hi rend="superscript">!</hi>

                <p>In the series of tangent lines there are in general two (real or imaginary)
                    lines, each of which meets the surface in a second consecutive point, or say it
                    has three-point intersection with the surface; these are called the
                    chieftangents (Haupt-tangenten). The tangent-plane cuts the surface in a curve,
                    having at the point of contact a node (double point), the tangents to the two
                    branches being the chief-tangents.</p>
                <p>In the case of a quadric surface the curve of intersection, <hi rend="italic"
                    >qua</hi> curve of the second order, can only have a node by breaking up into a
                    pair of lines; that is, every tangentplane meets the surface in a pair of lines,
                    or we have on the surface two singly infinite systems of lines; these are τeal
                    for the hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid of one sheet, imaginary in
                    other cases.</p>
                <p>At each point of a surface the chief-tangents determine two directions; and
                    passing along one of them to a consecutive point, and thence (without abrupt
                    change of direction) along the new chief-tangent to a consecutive point, and so
                    on, we have on the surface a chief-tangent curve; and there are, it is clear,
                    two singly infinite series of such curves. In the case of a quadric surface, the
                    curves are the right lines on the surface.</p>
                <p>40. If at the point we draw in the tangent-plane two lines bisecting the angles
                    between the chief-tangents, these lines (which are at right angles to each
                    other) are called the principal tangents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Proceeding from the point along a principal tangent to a consecutive point on the

                    curvature; there are, it is clear, two singly infinite series of such curves,
                    cutting each other at right angles at each point of the surface.</p>
                <p>Passing from the given point in an arbitrary direction to a consecutive point on
                    the surface, the normal at the given point is not intersected by the normal at
                    the consecutive point; but passing to the consecutive point along a curve of
                    curvature (or, .what is the same thing, along a principal tangent) the normal at
                    the given point is intersected by the normal at the consecutive point <hi
                    rend="italic">; we</hi> have thus on the normal two centres of curvature, and
                    the distances of these from the point on the surface are the two principal radii
                    of curvature of the surface at that point; these are also the radii of curvature
                    of the sections of the surface by planes through the normal and the two
                    principal tangents respectively; or say they are the radii of curvature of the
                    normal sections through the two principal tangents respectively. Take at the

                <p>The normal sections of the surface and the paraboloid by the same plane have the
