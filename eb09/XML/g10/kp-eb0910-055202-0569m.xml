                    (18C5-1871), one of the most eminent literary and political historians of
                    Germany, was born on May 20. 1805, at Darmstadt. His well-to-do parents,
                    belonging to the middle classes, had him educated at the gymnasium of the town,
                    where he studied with great success. At the age of fourteen they chose for him a
                    commercial career, but Gervinus continued his classical studies privately, and
                    made himself fully acquainted with the polite literature of Germany and other
                    countries. He also cultivated his literary and musical taste by frequenting the
                    theatre of the Hessian capital, which was then in an excellent condition. In
                    1825 he relinquished the uncongenial commercial life, and repaired, after a
                    brief preparation, to the university of Giessen to study philology. The short
                    interruption in his school education helped to develop in him, in an eminent
                    degree, his social qualities, and taught him to employ methodically and usefully
                    every hour of his life. In 1826 he went to Heidelberg, where he attended the
                    lectures of the great historian Schlosser, who became henceforth his guide and
                    his model. From 1828 to 1830 he held a mastership in a private institution at
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main, issuing at the same time, in conjunction with Morstadt
                    and Hertlein, a comprehensive edition of Thucydides, and writing an essay on
                    Bloomfield’s English translation of the Greek historian. In 1830 he returned to
                    Heidelberg, and wrote among other essays one on Probert’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancient Laws of Cambria.</hi> The year 1832 he spent in Italy as travelling
                    tutor to a young Englishman, and on his return to Heidelberg he wrote several
                    historical treatises, which he issued in 1833, in a collected form, as the first
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Historische Schriften.</hi> This publication
                    procured him the appointment of professor extraordinarius; and the first volume
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der poetischen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Natio</hi><hi rend="italic">nalliterαtur</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Deutschen</hi> brought him, through the special recommendation of the historian
                    Dahlmann, the appointment to a regular professorship of history and literature
                    at Göttingen. He settled there at Easter 1836, and married a wealthy young lady,
                    who proved a true “companion to his intellect.” In the following year he wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Grundzüge der Historik,</hi> which is perhaps the most
                    thoughtful of his philosophico-historical productions. The same year brought his
                    expulsion from Göttingen in consequence of his manly protest, in conjunction
                    with six of his colleagues, against the unscrupulous violation of the
                    constitution by Ernest Augustus, king of Hanover and duke of Cumberland. After
                    applying himself to his literary and artistic studies at Heidelberg, Darmstadt,
                    and Rome, he returned once more to Heidelberg, where he continued, among other
                    works, his history of German literature, and was appointed in 1844 honorary
                    professor. He zealously took up in the following year the cause of the German
                    Catholics, hoping it would lead to a union of all the Christian confessions, and
                    to the establishment of a national church. He also came forward in 1846 as a
                    patriotic champion of the Schleswig-Holsteiners, and when, in 1847, King
                    Frederick William IV. promulgated the royal decree for summoning the so-called
                    “United Diet” (Vereinigte Landtag), Gervinus hoped that this event would form
                    the basis of the constitutional development of the largest German state; and,
                    thinking that the hour of publicistic activity had arrived, he founded, in
                    common with some other patriotic scholars, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitung,</hi> which certainly was one of the
                    best-written political journals ever published in Germany. His appearance in the
                    political arena secured his election as deputy for the Prussian province of
                    Saxony to the National Assembly sitting in 1848 at Frankfort. The weight of his
                    name and his journalistic activity were of considerable advantage to the
                    liberals in that shortlived parliament; but when he saw that all their
                    endeavours were frustrated by the indecision of the king of Prussia, who
                    declined accepting the imperial crown of Germany, he retired in gloomy
                    disappointment from all active political life. So embittered was he against the
                    royal house of Hohenzol∙ lern that neither the formation of the North German
                    Confederation in 1866, which in former years he would have hailed with the
                    greatest satisfaction, nor the glorious establishment<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0570-0553"/> in 1870 of an united German empire, could
                    reconcile him to a dynasty one sickly scion of which had foiled the national
                    aspirations of Germany. Gervinus now took refuge among his literary and
                    historical studies, more especially devoting himself to the study of
                    Shakespeare, the result of which was his great work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shakespeare</hi> (1849, 1850), in four volumes. He also revised his <hi
                    rend="italic">magnum opus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">History of German
                    Literature,</hi> for a fourth edition (1853), and began at the same time to plan
                    his <hi rend="italic">History of the</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">⅛th Century,</hi>
                    which was to be a continuation of the <hi rend="italic">History of the</hi> 18i
                    ’ ∕i <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> by his guide and teacher, Schlosser. He
                    heralded that voluminous work by a programme or manifesto entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Einleitung</hi><hi rend="italic">in die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts,</hi> which was issued in 1853, and
                    made a great stir in the literary and political world, chiefly owing to the
                    circumstance that the Government of Baden imprudently instituted a prosecution
                    against the author for high treason. Gervinus had prophesied in his famous
                    pamphlet the final victory of democracy, and based bis prediction on the theory
                    that all the great revolutionary outbreaks follow each other in a kind of
                    geometrical progression,— to wit, 1820, 1830, and 1848. Hence he concluded that
                    the next great revolutionary shock would take place about 1888-1890, and that it
                    would insure the final victory to democracy, just as the same decade brought in
                    former centuries freedom and independence to the Americans, the French, the
                    English, and the inhabitants of the Netherlands. Arraigned before a tribunal, he
                    defended himself with a great display of ability and manly courage, but was
                    nevertheless condemned to an imprisonment of two months, and all the copies of
                    the “seditious publication” were to be destroyed. Fortunately for Germany, this
                    disgrace was spared her, the verdict having been rescinded by a higher tribunal.
                    This occurrence, which would have aroused a more elastic temper to greater
                    political activity, had the contrary effect upon the sensitive mind of Gervinus.
                    He buried himself still more among his books, and even forebore to deliver
                    lectures. With unwearied energy he now devoted himself to his above-mentioned
                    great historical work, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts
                    seit den Wiener Verträgen,</hi> which he issued in eight volumes, the first in
                    1855 and the last in 1866. In the midst of his historical studies he found
                    relief in his devotion to the works of his favourite musician Handel. He
                    founded, and liberally supported, the Handel Society in Germany, whose object it
                    was to restore the compositions of the great master in an authentic form, and to
                    issue German versions of the texts suitable to the compositions. The result of
                    his Handel studies was his critical and aesthetical work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Händel und Shakespeare, zur</hi><hi rend="italic">Aesthetik</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der Tonkunst</hi> (1868), in which he drew an ingenious parallel
                    between his favourite poet and his favourite composer, showing that their
                    intellectual affinity was based on the Teutonic origin common to both, on the
                    same healthiness of their mental capacities, on their analogous intellectual
                    development, and even on a similarity of their inclinations and fates. This
                    philosophical treatise fell flat on the German public, who could not forgive the
                    author for having extolled Handel above the great national masters, Haydn,
                    Mozart, and Beethoven. The ill-success of that publication, and the indifference
                    with which the latter volumes of his <hi rend="italic">History of the</hi> 19∕Λ
                    <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> were received by his countrymen, together with
                    the feeling of disappointment that the unity of Germany had been brought about
                    in another fashion and by other means than he wished to see employed, combined
                    to embitter in the highest degree the writer and the politician, but it could
                    not sour in him his kindly and humane disposition, nor did it in the least
                    affect his sociable temper, and he cultivated refined society to the last. He
                    died rather suddenly, on the 18th of March 1871.</p>
                <p>The works which will, above all others, insure to Gervinus a lasting fame, are
                    his Geschichte der Deutschen Dichtung, and his work on Shakespeare. The former,
                    a fifth edition of which was edited (1871-74) by the eminent literary historian
                    and philologist, Professor Karl Bartsch of Heidelberg, was the first
                    comprehensive history of German poetry in a connected form, and was executed
                    with a literary skill, a profound erudition, and a lofty enthusiasm for the
                    subject, which imprinted upon it the stamp of a national work of permanent
                    value. The author represented the literary activity of Germany in its successive
                    stages as it grew out of her political life, thus making political history the
                    foil and basis of literary history. His judgment was sincere and independent,
                    and although his criticism often assumed a censorious and pedantic tone against
                    the most prominent poets of Germany, the German people, without allowing
                    themselves to be misguided in their judgment regarding the merits of Goethe,
                    Schiller, Jean Paul, &amp;c., gratefully accepted his work as a national homage
                    to that subject of which they have most reason to be proud. The object of
                    Gervinus in writing his literary history was, besides, a patriotic one. He
                    endeavoured to show that Germany, having already attained great eminence in
                    literature, should henceforth exclusively devote herself to political activity,
                    and surpass other nations also in this respect. He had a no less patriotic
                    object in view in writing his commentary on Shakespeare, which has been made
                    popular in England by an excellent translation. This work is not so much a
                    philological or aesthetical commentary as a treatise pointing out the ethical or
                    moral precepts which may be deduced from his productions, and this circumstance
                    makes it of considerable value and interest also to English readers. Gervinus,
                    who considered Shakespeare the intellectual property of Germany, in the same way
                    as he considered Handel the artistic property of England, wished above all to
                    inculcate on his countrymen the teachings of healthy practical activity to be
                    found in the works of the English dramatist. The object for which he wrote,
                    viz., the moral improvement of his readers from a practical point of view,
                    seemed to him the easier to be accomplished through the productions of
                    Shakespeare, because the poet was descended from a kindred race, and the
                    fructifying seeds of his thoughts and sentiments, falling upon a congenial soil,
                    would bo sure to take root there kindly. As a political historian, Gervinus was
                    the antipode of Ranke. Following the principles of F. C. Schlosser, he slighted
                    all documentary history. He had such a deep distrust of all state papers and
                    diplomatic documents that he considered them as most untrustworthy sources for
                    any historical record. He confined himself, therefore, chiefly to taking into
                    account the political events and their results just as they lay on the surface;
                    and, not consulting the state archives for the secret springs which set them in
                    motion, he based his historical narratives almost entirely on his subjective
                    judgment. Many brilliant passages will be found in his general History of the
                    19ZA, Century, such as the accounts of the South American and Greek revolutions,
                    and of the July revolution in 1830; and his Historische Schriften also contain a
                    number of valuable treatises and essays, which may be said to have paved the way
                    to a new era in the art of writing history. Gervinus entertained a kindly
                    feeling towards England, which he called the land of political mastery; and
                    though he was, what is both the bane and the glory of so many Germans, rather a
                    cosmopolitan, he nevertheless remained a German patriot to the core. He was,
                    besides, distinguished by a rare nobleness and manliness of character, and
                    considering that he was a powerful factor in the literary and political progress
                    of modern times, we may fully agree with Ranke’s opinion “that he will never be
                    forgotten.” (C. A. B.)</p>
