                    descends to earth it is the chief blessing to men, while in the clouds it
                    gladdens the dwellers there. Hence arises the idea of a drink for the gods—the
                    soma of the Hindus, the meth of the Norsemen, and the nectar of the Greeks—which
                    plays such an important part in the <hi rend="italic">Rig Veda,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda,</hi> and the Homeric poetry. The guardian and giver of the
                    divine drink occurs in many forms, sometimes as a bird, sometimes as a divine
                    being. Just as the eagle brings nectar to Zeus in Crete, so Odin takes the form
                    of an eagle to steal the meth from Guttung for the use of the gods. The same
                    divinity that in heaven distributes the drink to the gods is on earth the genius
                    that presides over the due supply of water. Hence among the Greeks Ganymede, as
                    this genius is called, exists in heaven as the Aquarius of the zodiac (Hyginus,
                    fab. 224), while on earth he is, as Pindar (fr. 267 [H0]) tells us, the genius
                    of the fountains of the Nile, which was <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>
                    the life-giving and fertilizing river of the earth.</p>
                <p>But the form under which the Ganymede myth most commonly appears has its origin
                    in Asia Minor and in Crete. Homer (ZZ., xx. 232) says that Ganymede was a son of
                    Tros, and that the gods on account of his beauty carried him off to heaven to
                    dwell among the immortals and pour out the wine for Zeus. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Little Iliad</hi> again makes him the son of Laomedon, and says that Zeus gave
                    his father a golden vine in exchange for him. In the Trojan Ganymede there is
                    not much trace left of the old kindly genius who distributes the blessing out of
                    the clouds. We may indeed, when we remember that the Greeks admired personal
                    beauty as almost divine <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Hdt., V. 47), be able to see
                    in this translation the good genius returning alive to heaven after his sojourn
                    on earth, an idea that occurs in the mythology of almost every race. But now he
                    seems rather to represent the everlasting youth and beauty that attend on the
                    gods, and to be the male counterpart of Hebe, who was worshipped in Phlius under
                    the name Ganymeda (Pausanias, ii. 13). More and more the myth grows away from
                    its earliest form, and as Greek manners altered the darkest side of their social
                    system attached itself to it. Through the Ionian Greeks the Asiatic custom of
                    secluding women had spread to the mother country and superseded the old heroic
                    manners. The presence of women at meal-times, customary in the time of Homer <hi
                    rend="italic">(f)d.,</hi> iv. 221), was now discontinued. Beautiful young male
                    slaves waited at banquets, and the feeling grew that the gods also observed this
                    custom. Ganymede was now conceived as the favourite of Zeus. So early as the
                    Hymn to Aphrodite, Zeus himself carries off Ganymede on account of his beauty;
                    and Theognis (about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> speaks of the love of
                    Zeus for Ganymede as a well-known tale. In Crete especially, where the love of
                    boys was systematized and legalized, and from which the habit spread over the
                    whole of Greece, does the myth find nourishment and growth. On the one hand,
                    Zeus was represented to have himself, in the form of an eagle, carried off
                    Ganymede; on the other hand, it was said that Minos, the primitive ruler and
                    lawgiver of Crete, had been the ravisher of Ganymede. In this way it was
                    attempted to give dignity and antiquity to a borrowed and loathsome custom. The
                    rapidity with which the habit spread all over Greece makes the mythical
                    embodiment of it fill an important place in the painting, sculpture, and
                    literature of Greece in its decline. Thus it comes that the name which once
                    denoted the good genius that gives the best gifts to man was adopted in the
                    vulgar Latin under the form Catamitus to signify the most degraded of men (on
                    this subject <hi rend="italic">ν.</hi> Böttiger, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kunst-Mythoi.,</hi> ii. 35, 61).</p>
                <p>It is significant that in Greek art not one very early representation of the myth
                    occurs (Overbeek, <hi rend="italic">Kunst-Mythologie,</hi> p. 515); but in the
                    middle and later periods it becomes a favourite subject. Two moments especially
                    are represented—(1) Ganymede carried off by the eagle, where the eagle is
                    sometimes Zeus’s messenger, but at other times obviously Zeus himself, as is
                    shown by the sensual passion apparent in both figures (Jahn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archoeolog.</hi><hi rend="italic">Beiträge,</hi> p. 20), and (2) Ganymede
                    feeding or caressing the eagle.</p>
