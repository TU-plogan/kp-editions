                    little importance, in spite of its manufactures of cloth, leather, wooden shoes,
                    and wax-lights, had it not for long centuries been the seat of a unique method
                    of dealing with the insane. A local legend, tracing the origin of the town back
                    to a chapel of St Martin erected in the 7th century, goes on to tell how an
                    Irish princess, fearing the fate that long afterwards befel Beatrice Cenci,
                    sought refuge in this remote asylum, but was pursued by her relentless father
                    and put to death, along with a priest Gerrebert, the companion of her flight.
                    The tomb of the victims was soon discovered to have a healing virtue for minds
                    diseased: the sainted Dymphna became the patroness of the insane; and a large
                    and beautiful church in her honour was erected on the site of St Martin’s
                    chapel. Commenced in the 12th century, it was finished in 1340, and consecrated
                    by the bishop of Cambray; and the pilgrimages to the tomb were sanctioned by a
                    brief of Eugenius IV. In 1538 Jean de Mérode, within whose domains the church
                    was situated, instituted a vicariate of nine priests and a director, and in 1562
                    Henri de Mérode transformed the vicariate into a regular chapter of nine canons
                    and a dean. The church still remains to bear witness to the importance formerly
                    attached to the shrine; and though the tomb of St Dymphna has long been a
                    cenotaph, a few stray enthusiasts still pass beneath it in hopeful imitation of
                    the thousands in byegone years, whose knees have worn deep furrows in the
                    pavement as they made their ninefold transits on nine successive days. As food
                    and lodging had to be provided for the patients who were brought to the saint,
                    the inhabitants of Gheel grew accustomed to the treatment of the various kinds
                    of mental alienation, and gradually discovered that forcible measures were much
                    less frequently necessary, and danger less likely to result from free
                    intercourse with the insane, than was generally believed throughout Europe. When
                    M. Pontecoulant was appointed by Napoleon prefect of the Revolution department
                    of the Dyle, his attention was called to the success of the domestic régime in
                    force at Gheel, in contrast to the sad condition of affairs in the asylum at
                    Brussels, and he caused the patients to be removed from the capital to the
                    little country town. His example was freely followed by the authorities of
                    different districts, and Gheel received full official recognition.
                    Investigations undertaken about 1850 by M. Ducpétiaux, inspector-general of
                    benevolent establishments in Belgium, resulted in the reform of such abuses as
                    had crept into the system; and the relations of the patient and his protectors
                    were placed on a strict legal footing by the law of 1st May 1851. Further
                    ameliorations have been introduced in 1852,1857, 1858, &amp;c. The whole
                    management of the system is under the supervision of officially appointed
                    physicians, and the advantages of a regular establishment are thus combined with
                    those of domestic comfort, social freedom, and activity. Permission to receive
                    patients is granted not only to the town residents, but also to the villagers of
                    the vicinity.</p>
