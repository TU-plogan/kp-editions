                    prominent leader of the German Catholic movement was Johann Ronge, a Roman
                    Catholic priest, who in October 1844 made a vigorous attack upon Arnoldi, bishop
                    of Treves, for having made a relic, which he alleged to be the holy seamless
                    coat of Christ, an object of pilgrimage and adoration. On Ronge’s
                    excommunication on this account, by the chapter of Breslau in December 1844, he
                    received a large amount of public sympathy, and a dissenting congregation was
                    almost immediately formed at Breslau with a very simple creed, in which the
                    chief articles were belief in God the Father, creator and ruler of the universe;
                    in Jesus Christ the Saviour, who delivers from the bondage of sin by his life,
                    doctrine, and death; in the operation of the Holy Ghost; in a holy, universal,
                    Christian church; in forgiveness of sins and the life everlasting. Within a very
                    few weeks similar communities had been formed at Leipsic, Dresden, Berlin,
                    Offenbach, Worms, Wiesbaden, and elsewhere; and at a “council” convened at
                    Leipsic in March 1845, twenty-seven congregations were represented by delegates,
                    of whom however only two or at most three were in clerical orders. Almost
                    contemporaneously with the commencement of the agitation led by Ronge, another
                    movement fundamentally distinct, though in some respects similar, had been
                    originated at Schneidemühl, Posen, under the guidance of Johann Czerski, also a
                    priest, who had come into collision with the church authorities on the then much
                    discussed question of mixed marriages, and also on that of the celibacy of the
                    clergy. The result had been his suspension from office in March 1844; his public
                    withdrawal, along with twenty-four adherents, from the Roman communion in
                    August; his excommunication immediately<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0460-0445"/> thereafter; and the formation, in October, of a
                    “Catholic Apostolic Christian” congregation which, while rejecting various
                    practices of the Roman Church, retained the Nicene theology and the doctrineof
                    the seven sacraments. Czerski had been at some of the sittings of the “German
                    Catholic” council of Leipsic; but when a formula somewhat similar to that of
                    Breslau had been adopted, he refused to adhibit his signature because the
                    divinity of Christ had been ignored, and he and his congregation continued to
                    retain by preference the name of “Catholic Apostolic Christians” which they had
                    originally assumed. Of the German Catholic congregations which had been
                    represented at Leipsic some manifested a preference for the fuller and more
                    positive creed of Schneidemühl, but a great majority continued to accept the
                    comparatively negative theology of the Breslau school. The number of these
                    increased with considerable rapidity, until in June 1846 in Silesia alone the
                    members of the German Catholic communion were reckoned by thousands, while the
                    congregations scattered over Germany amounted in all to 173. In Austria,
                    however, and ultimately also in Bavaria, the use of the name German Catholics
                    was officially prohibited, that of “Dissidents” being substituted, while in
                    Prussia the adherents of the new creed were laid under various disabilities;
                    these and other circumstances, among which the frequent occurrence of internal
                    dissensions was perhaps the gravest, conspired to check at an early stage the
                    prosperous career of a movement which in its begin nings had been looked upon by
                    many intelligent observers with considerable hopefulness. In 1859 some of the
                    German Catholics entered into a union with the “Free Congregations,” when the
                    united body took the title of “The Religious Society of Free Congregations.”
                    Before that time many of the congregations which were formed in 1844 and the
                    years immediately following had been dissolved, including that of Schneidemühl
                    itself, which ceased to exist in 1857. No very recent statistics of a
                    trustworthy kind as to the numerical strength of the German Catholics are
                    accessible. Their total in Prussia was 6395 in 1861, and 10,920 *in 1867, while
                    in Saxony they numbered 1772 in 1849, and 3015 in 1871. At an early stage the
                    movement attracted the attention of Gervinus, the eminent historian and critic,
                    who in 1846 published a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Die Mission des
                    DeutscJíkatholicismus,</hi> to which, as well as to Kampe’s treatise <hi
