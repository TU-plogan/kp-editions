                    modern students and travellers. The lake was also called the Sea of Chinnereth
                    or Chinneroth, and the Lake of Gennesaret or Tiberias; and by Pliny it is said
                    to have been once called Lake of Taricheae. In form it is pearshaped, 12 j
                    English miles in length, and 7∣ at its greatest width. The level is now known to
                    be 682 ’ 5 feet below the Mediterranean. The water is fresh and clear, and large
                    shoals of fish abound in it. The formation of the lake basin occurred later than
                    the Chalk period, and was due to a subsidence of the strata, which appears to
                    have been sudden and violent, and probably accompanied by extensive volcanic
                    eruptions from three centres east, west, and north of the lake. The district has
                    always been liable to volcanic disturbance and to earthquakes. In 1837 Safed and
                    Tiberias were destroyed by earthquake, and the temperature of the hot springs
                    round the lake was then observed to rise considerably for a time.</p>
                <p>The Sea of Galilee is best seen from the top of the western precipices, and
                    presents a desolate appearance. On the north the hills rise gradually from the
                    shore, which is fringed with oleander bushes and indented with small bays. The
                    ground is here covered with black basalt. On the west the plateau of el Ahma
                    terminates in precipices 1700 feet above the lake, and over these the black
                    rocky tops called “the Horns of Hattιn” are conspicuous objects. On the south is
                    a broad valley through which the Jordan flows. On the east are furrowed and
                    rugged slopes, rising to the great plateau <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> of the
                    Jaulân (Gaulonitis). The Jordan enters the lake through a narrow gorge between
                    lower hills. A marshy plain, 2⅜ miles long and I£ broad, called el Batιhah,
                    exists immediately east of the Jordan inlet There is also on the west side of
                    the lake a small plain called el Ghuweir, formed by the junction of three large
                    valleys. It measures 3∣ miles along the shore, and is 1 mile wide. This plain,
                    naturally fertile, but now almost uncultivated, is recognized to be the plain of
                    Gennesaretħ, described by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(B. J.,</hi> iii. 10, 8).
                    The shores of the lake are of fine shingle. On the east the hills approach in
                    one place within 40 feet of the water, but there is generally a width of about ∣
                    of a mile from the hills to the beach. On the west the flat ground at the foot
                    of the hills has an average width of about 200 yards. A few scattered palms dot
                    the western shores, and a palm grove is to be found near Kefr Hârib on the
                    south-east. Thermal springs are found on each side of the lake, with an average
                    temperature of about 80° Fahr. The hot baths south of Tiberias include seven
                    springs, the largest of which has a temperature of 137° Fahr. The plain of
                    Gennesareth, with its environs, is the best watered part of the lake-basin.
                    North of this plain are the five springs of et Tâbghah, the largest of which was
                    enclosed about a century ago by Aly, son of Dhahr el ’Amr, in an octagonal
                    reservoir, and the water led off by an aqueduct 52 feet above the lake. The
                    Tâbghah springs, though abundant, are warm and brackish. At the north end of the
                    plain is ’Ain et Tîneh (“spring of the fig-tree ”), also a brackish spring with
                    a good stream; south of the plain is ’Ain el Bârdeh (“the cold spring”), which
                    is sweet, but scarcely lower in temperature than the others. The most important
                    spring remains still to be noticed, namely, ’Ain el Madâwerah (“the round spring
                    ”), situated 1 mile from the south end of the plain and half a mile from the
                    shore. The water rises in a circular well 32 feet in diameter, and is clear and
                    sweet, with a temperature of 73° Fahr. The bottom is of loose sand, and the fish
                    called coracinus by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(B.</hi><hi rend="italic">J,</hi>
                    iii. 10, 8) is here found in abundance. Dr Tristram was the first explorer to
                    identify this fish, and points out that it could not exist in the other springs.
                    We are thus able to identify the “round spring” with the fountain of Capharnaum,
                    which, according to Josephus, watered the plain of Gennesareth.</p>
                <p>The principal sites of interest round the lake may be enumerated from north to
                    west and from south to east. Kerâzeh, the undoubted site of Chorazin, stands on
                    a rocky spur 900 feet above the lake, 2 miles north of the shore. Foundations
                    and scattered stones cover the slopes and the flat valley below. On the west is
                    a rugged gorge. In the middle of the ruins are the remains of a synagogue of
                    richly ornamental style built of black basalt. A small spring occurs on the
                    north. Tell Hûm is an important ruin on the shore south of the last mentioned
                    site. The remains consist of foundations and scattered stones (which in spring
                    are concealed by gigantic thistles) extending about half a mile along the shore.
                    The foundations of a fine synagogue, measuring 75 feet by 57, and built in white
                    limestone, have been excavated. A conspicuous building has been erected close to
                    the water, from the fragments of the Tell Hûm synagogue. Since the 4th century
                    Tell Hûm has been pointed out by all the Christian writers as the site of
                    Capernaum, but the fatal objections to such an identification are—(1) the great
                    distance from the fountain of Capharnaum, and (2) the fact that Jewish tradition
                    preserves another site. The ruins at Tell Hûm are not of necessity as old as the
                    time of Christ. The name Hûm means “black,” and is probably connected with the
                    surrounding black basalt. The place seems to be mentioned in the Talmud under
                    the titles Caphar Ahim and Caphar Tanhumin (see Neubauer’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geog. Taι.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> p. 220). Minyeh is a ruined
                    site at the north end of the plain of Gennesareth, 2∣ miles from the last, and
                    close to the shore. There are extensive ruins on flat ground, consisting of
                    mounds and foundations, with traces of a wall once surrounding the site. Masonry
                    of well-dressed stones has also been here discovered in course of excavation.
                    Near the ruins are remains of an old khan, which appears to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0039-0030"/> been built in the Middle Ages; and above this a
                    curious hillock, with an artificial rock-platform, called el Oreimeh, “the
                    little knoll.” Immediately to the north-east a precipice projects to the lake,
                    and the aqueduct from the Tâbghah spring is led to an ancient rock-cut channel,
                    which seems to have been once intended for a road in the face of the cliff. In
                    the 17th century Quaresmius speaks of this place, Minyeh, as the site of
                    Capernaum. In the 14th Isaac Chelo was apparently shown the same site as
                    containing the tomb of Nahum, and as being the “city of the Minai.” The “Minai,”
                    or “sorcerers,” are mentioned in the Talmud, and by this title the Jews
                    stigmatized the early Christians; and these “Minai” are called in one passage of
                    the Talmud “sons of Capernaum.” There is thus a close connexion between this
                    Minyeh—named from the Minai—and the town of Capernaum. The position of the site
                    is also suitable for that of Capernaum, being in the plain of Gennesareth, two
                    miles from the “round spring,” or fountain of Capharnaum. No other site of any
                    importance exists in the plain of Gennesareth. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Capernaum.</hi></p>
                <p>South of the plain of Gennesareth is the undisputed site of the New Testament
                    town of Magdala. A few lotus trees and some rock-cut tombs are here found beside
                    a miserable mud hamlet on the hill slope, with a modern tomb-house or <hi
                    rend="italic">kubbeh.</hi> Passing beneath rugged cliffs a recess in the hills
                    is next reached, where stands Tabariya, the ancient Tiberias or Rakkath,
                    containing 3000 inhabitants, more than half of whom are Jews. The walls, flanked
                    with round towers, and now partly destroyed by the earthquake of 1837, were
                    built by Dhahr el ’Amr, as was the serai or court-house. The two mosques, now
                    partly ruinous, were erected by his sons. There are remains of a crusading
                    church, and the tomb of the celebrated Maimonides is shown in the town, while
                    Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Meir lie buried outside. The ruins of the ancient city,
                    including granite columns and traces of a sea-wall with towers, stretch
                    southwards a mile beyond the modern town. An aqueduct in the cliff once brought
                    water a distance of 9 miles from the south.</p>
                <p>Kerak, at the south end of the lake, is an important site on a peninsula
                    surrounded by the water of the lake, by the Jordan, and by a broad water ditch,
                    while on the north-west a narrow neck of land remains. The plateau thus enclosed
                    is partly artificial, and banked up 50 or 60 feet above the water. A ruined
                    citadel remains on the north-west, and on the east was a bridge over the Jordan;
                    broken pottery and fragments of sculptured stone strew the site. The ruin of
                    Kerak answers to the description given by Josephus of the city of Taricheae,
                    which lay 30 stadia from Tiberias, the hot baths being between the two cities.
                    Taricheae was situated, as is Kerak, on the shore below the cliffs, and partly
                    surrounded by water, while before the city was a plain (the Ghor). Pliny further
                    informs us that Taricheae was at the south end of the Sea of Galilee. Sinnabreh,
                    a ruin on a spur of the hills close to the last-mentioned site, is undoubtedly
                    the ancient Sinnabris, where Vespasian (Joseph., <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi>
                    iii. 9, 7) fixed his camp, advancing from Scythopolis (Beisâ,n) on Taricheae and
                    Tiberias. Sinnabris was 30 stadia from Tiberias, or about the distance of the
                    ruin now existing.</p>
                <p>The eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee have been less fully explored than the
                    western, and the sites are not so perfectly recovered. The town of Hippo3, one
                    of the cities of Decapolis, was situated 30 stadia from Tiberias, and 60 stadia
                    from Gadara (Umm Keis). It 13 conjectured that the town Susitha, mentioned in
                    the Talmud, is the same place, and the name Susyeh seems to have existed east of
                    the Sea of Galilee at a late period. Susitha from “sus,” meaning “horse,” is,
                    etymologically at least, suggestive of the Greek “hippos.” The site is at
                    present unknown. Kalat el Hosn (“ca3tle of the stronghold ”) is a ruin on a
                    rocky spur opposite Tiberias. Two large ruined buildings remain, with traces of
                    an old street and fallen columns and capitals. A strong wall once surrounded the
                    town; a narrow neck of land exists on the east where the rock has been scarped.
                    Rugged valleys enclose the site on the north and south; broken sarcophagi and
                    rock-cut tombs are found beneath the ruin. This site answers to the description
                    Josephus gives of Gamala, an important fortress besieged by Vespasian <hi
                    rend="italic">{Bell. Jud.,</hi> iv. 1, 1). Gersa, an insignificant ruin north of
                    the last, is thought to represent the Gerasa or Gergesa of the 4th century,
                    situated east of the lake; and the projecting spur of hill south of this ruin is
                    conjectured to be the place where the swine “ran violently down a steep place”
                    (Matt, viii. 32). The site of Bethsaida Julias, east of Jordan, is also unknown.
                    It has been supposed (and the theory is supported by even so important an
                    authority as Reland) that two separate places named Bethsaida are mentioned in
                    the New Testament. The grounds for this conclusion are, however, very
                    insufficient; and only one Bethsaida is mentioned by Josephus. It was near the
                    Jordan inlet, on the east side of the river, and under its later Greek name of
                    Julias, it is mentioned, with Hippos, by Pliny. The site usually pointed out is
                    the ruin of et Tell, north of the Batihah plain; the remains are, however,
                    modern and insignificant. Just south of the same plain is a ruined village
                    called Mes’aidiyeh, the name of which approaches Bethsaida in sound but not in
                    meaning. This is the site pointed out by Vandevelde, and it is possible that the
                    course of Jordan has shifted westwards, and that the old mouth is marked by the
                    two creeks running into the shore on the east, in which case the site of
                    Mes’aidiyeh might be accepted as the Bethsaida of the gospels, which appears to
                    have been east of Jordan.</p>
