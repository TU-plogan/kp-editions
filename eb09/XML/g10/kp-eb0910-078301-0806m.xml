                    family of Aberdeenshire, who possessed the small estate of Auchleuchries, and
                    were connected with the house of Haddo. He was born in 1635, and after
                    completing his education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, entered, in
                    his fifteenth year, the J esuit college at Braunsberg, Prussia; but, as “his
                    humour could not endure such a still and strict way of living,” he soon resolved
                    to return home. He changed his mind, however, before re-embarking, and after
                    journeying on foot in several parts of Germany, ultimately, in 1655, enlisted at
                    Hamburg in the Swedish service. In the course of the next five years he served
                    alternately with the Poles and Swedes as he was taken prisoner by either. In
                    1661, after changing his resolution more than once, he took service in the
                    Russian army under Alexis I,, and in 1666 he was sent on a special mission to
                    England. After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the
                    Turks and Tartars in southern Russia, and in recognition of his services he in
                    1678 was made major-general, in 1679 was appointed to the chief command at
                    Kieff, and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general. He visited England in 1686, and,
                    after his return to Russia, he in 1687 and 1689 took part as
                    quartermaster-general in the expeditions against the Crim Tartars in the Crimea.
                    On the breaking out of the revolution in Moscow in the latter year, Gordon with
                    the troops he commanded virtually decided events in favour of the czar Peter I.,
                    and against the czarina Sophia. He was therefore during the remainder of his
                    life in high favour with the czar, who confided to him the command of his
                    capital during his absence from Russia, employed him in organizing his army
                    according to the European system, and latterly raised him to the rank of
                    general-in-chief. He died November 29, 1699. The czar, who had visited him
                    frequently during his illness, was with him when he died, and with his own hands
                    closed his eyes.</p>
                <p>General Gordon left behind him a diary of his life, written in English. Several
                    of those parts of the diary connected with the military history of Russia were
                    at an early period translated into German— then the literary language of St
                    Petersburg—but never printed, although made use of for various other works. A
                    complete German translation, by Prince Μ. A. Kolenski and Mr Μ. C. Powell, was
                    published, the first volume at Moscow in 1849, the second at St Petersburg in
                    1851, and the third at St Petersburg in 1853; and <hi rend="italic">Passages
                    from ths Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries,</hi> 1635-1699, was
                    printed, under the editorship of Joseph Robertson, for the Spalding Club,
                    Aberdeen, 1859.</p>
