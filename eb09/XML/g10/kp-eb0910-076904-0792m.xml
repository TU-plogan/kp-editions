                <p>Gonda presents the aspect of a vast plain with very slight undulations, studded
                    with groves of mango trees. The surface consists of a rich alluvial deposit
                    which is naturally divided into three great belts known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tarai</hi> or swampy tract, the <hi rend="italic">uparhàr</hi> or uplands, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">tarhar</hi> or wet lowlands, all three being marvellously
                    fertile. Several rivers flow through the district, but only two, the Gogra and
                    Râpti, are of any commercial importance, the first being navigable throughout
                    the year, and the latter during the rainy season. The country is dotted over
                    with small lakes, <pb break="no"

                <p>This district has no particular history of its own; what ancient history it has
                    is included in that of Oudh. On the outbreak of the mutiny, the raja of Gonda,
                    after honourably escorting the Government treasure to Fyzabad, joined the
                    rebels. His estates, along with those of the rani of Tulsipur, were confiscated,
                    and conferred as rewards upon the maharajas of Balrampur and Shahganj, who had
                    remained loyal. The census of 1869 disclosed a population of 1,166,515 (602,862
                    males, and563,653 females)—Hindus, 1,049,397; Mahometans, 117,070;
                    Christians—European, Eurasian, and native —48. Five towns contain a population
                    exceeding 5000, namely, Gonda, Balrampur, Colonelganz, Nawabganj, and Utraula.
                    Rice, wheat, and barley are the chief products of the district. The area under
                    cultivation is 993,858 acres. The exports are rice and food grains; the imports,
                    cotton, European piece goods, and salt. The administration is under a deputy
                    commissioner, aided by two European assistants. The total revenue (1875-76)
                    amounted to £135,509; the expenditure to £15,810. The police force (1873)
                    consisted of 484 officers and men, maintained at a cost of £6655. Education is
                    still in its infancy. In 1875-76 there were 116 schools under Government
                    inspection, attended by 5879 pupils. Fever is prevalent throughout the district.
                    The other principal diseases are scurvy, cholera, diarrhoea, and goitre. The
                    average rainfall during the eleven years 1865-1875 was 42’0 inches. The average
                    yearly temperature is 77 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5° Fahr., the highest
                    recorded being 106°, the lowest 48°.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;3onda,</hi> the chief town and administrative
                    headquarters of Gouda district, in 27° 8' N. lat. and 82° 1' E. long. The site
                    on which the town now stands was originally a jungle, in the centre of which was
                    a cattle fold (Gontha or Gothân), in which the cattle were enclosed at night as
                    a protection against wild beasts, and from this the town derived its name. The
                    place was formerly celebrated for the manufacture of shields; now it is neither
                    of commercial nor of religious importance. The town contains a civil station,
                    dispensary, school, literary institute, courthouse, and jail. Population,
