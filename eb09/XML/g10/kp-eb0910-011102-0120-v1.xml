                <p><label type="entry">GAUL</label>, the name given by the Romans to the country
                    lying between the Rhine and the Pyrenees. When the Greeks first became
                    acquainted with the south-west of Europe they applied to the whole of it, in a
                    somewhat vague sense, the term Celtice (∙&gt;) <hi rend="italic"
                        >^K,eλτικη),</hi> calling its inhabitants Celts (Keλroi). Later we find
                    Galatia (Γαλατία) and Gallia (Γαλλία), with the corresponding Galati (Γαλάτοι)
                    and Galli (Γάλλοι), used as nearly synonymous with the earlier name. The shorter
                    of these two forms the Romans adopted; and in the opening chapter of Caesar’s
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> we have our first definite
                    account of the limits of the country and its divisions, as then understood.
                    According to this authority, Gaul was in his day divided among three peoples,
                    more or less distinct from one another, the Aquitani, the Gauls, who called
                    themselves Celts, and the Belgae. The first of these extended from the Pyrenees
                    to the Garumna (Garonne); the second from that river to the Sequana (Seine) and
                    its chief tributary the Matrona (Marne), reaching eastward presumably as far as
                    the Rhenus (Rhine); and the third from this bounding line to the mouth of the
                    last-named river, thus bordering on the Germans. By implication Caesar
                    recognizes a fourth division, the Provincia, lying to the south in the basin of
                    the Rhodanus (Rhone), and stretching westwards as far as Tolosa (Toulouse) in
                    the basin of the Garonne—a portion of Gaul that had been subdued and made a
                    Roman province about fifty years before Caesar entered on his career of conquest
                    there. By far the greater part of the country was a plain watered by numerous
                    rivers,-the chief of which have already been mentioned, with the exception of
                    its great central stream, the Liger or Ligeris (Loire). Its principal mountain
                    ranges were Cebenna or Gehenna (Cevennes) in the south, and Jura, with its
                    continuation Vosegus or Vogesus (Vosges), in the east. The tribes inhabiting
                    Gaul in Caesar’s time, and belonging to one or other of the three races
                    distinguished by him, were numerous. Prominent among them, and dwelling in the
                    division occupied by the Celts, were the Helvetii, the Sequani, and the Aedui,
                    in the basins of the Rhodanus and its tributary the Arar (Saône), who, he says,
                    were reckoned the three most powerful nations in all Gaul; the Arverni in the
                    mountains of Cebenna; the Senones and Carnutes in the basin of the Liger; the
                    Veneti and other Armorican tribes between the mouths of the Liger and Sequana.
                    The Nervii, Bellovaci, Suessiones, Remi, Morini, Menapii, and Aduatici were
                    Belgic tribes; the Tarbelli and others were Aquitani; while the Allobroges
                    inhabited the north of the Provincia, having been conquered in 121 B.c.</p>
                <p>The ethnological relations of Caesar’s three great Gallic races have given rise
                    to much discussion. Greek writers, who, in consequence of the planting of the
                    colony of Massilia (Marseilles) on its southern coast at so early a period as
                    600 B.c., had gained some knowledge of Gaul before the Romans, speak of its
                    inhabitants as Ligurians; and it is certain that a people of this name occupied
                    at one time the coast-line of Europe from the western slopes of the maritime
                    Alps to the Rhone. By many these Ligurians are regarded as having once spread
                    themselves over a much wider area, peopling extensive tracts of Europe as well
                    as Northern Africa. Subsequently, another race, coming probably across the
                    Pyrenees from Spain, subdued south-western Gaul and ruled as far north as the
                    Garonne—the Basques of the two slopes of these mountains remaining to our own
                    day their lineal representatives. Later still, but at a date which history does
                    not venture to fix, one of those great waves of population that are believed to
                    have rolled in succession from east to west brought into northern and central
                    Gaul, it may be at an interval of centuries, the two great branches of the
                    Celtic race, the Gadhelic or Gaelic and the Cymric—the one represented in
                    Britain by the Irish and Scottish Highlanders, the other by the Welsh. Reading
                    Caesar’s brief statements by the light thus afforded, ethnologists now generally
                    hold that his Aquitani were Iberians, largely intermingled with intrusive Gauls;
                    that his Gauls belonged to the Gaelic division of the Celtic race, and his
                    Belgae to the Cymric (both of them, however, being affected by the presence of
                    races whose territory they had overrun, and the latter by the addition of a
                    German element derived from their proximity to the Rhine); and that the natives
                    of the Provincia were Ligurians, with so large an intermixture of Celts as to
                    make the latter the dominant race. Neither the Qreek colony of Massilia, nor
                    those colonies sent out by it, can be supposed to have seriously affected the
                    Gaulish nation from the point of view we are now discussing. It was in a
                    different manner, as a civilizing agency, that they made their presence
                    felt.</p>
                <p>Such, it would appear, was Gaul ethnologically when made a part of the Roman
                    empire by Julius Caesar shortly before the commencement of the Christian era;
                    and, as has often been remarked, such in the main it is still. Some recent
                    scientific inquirers find grounds, however, for concluding<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0121-0112"/> that the opinion, so prevalent not only in
                    England but in France itself, that the physical and mental characteristics of
                    the modern Frenchman are chiefly derived from the ancient Gauls, is only in part
                    well founded. The Gauls, they say, like the Romans after them, were strong
                    enough to impose their language on a race or races they had subjugated; but in
                    the attempt to absorb them they themselves have suffered and continue to suffer
                    so much that the day may yet come when the older race will all but regain its
                    superiority. Slowly but surely, according to the researches of Μ. Roget, Baron
                    de Belloguet, the blue-eyed, fair-haired, long-headed Celt has for many
                    generations been giving place throughout France, in a direction proceeding from
                    south to north, to a more ancient, dark-eyed, black-haired, round-headed man—a
                    similar phenomenon being also noticeable among the Germans.</p>
                <p>Northern Italy, in consequence of an intrusion of Gauls at some early date,
                    received from the Romans the name of Gallia Cisalpina or Citerior, to
                    distinguish it from Gaul proper, called also Gallia Transalpina or Ulterior.
                    Afterwards when the Roman element gained the upper hand, Togata was sometimes
                    substituted for Cisalpina; while in contradistinction, Gallia Braccata was
                    applied to the Provincia from the <hi rend="italic">braccoe</hi> or trousers
                    worn by the natives, and Gallia Comata to the rest of the country, from the
                    inhabitants wearing their hair long. The Gaulish emigrations into Spain on the
                    one hand, and into Britain on the other, scarcely come under the present
                    article; still less can we refer here to the inroads of that restless race into
                    various parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. But it may be remarked in
                    passing that so extensive were the conquests of the Gauls that, in the beginning
                    of the third century before our era, their empire, if much less compact, was
                    scarcely less extensive than that of Rome in her palmiest days.</p>
                <p>For some time after the death of Caesar little attention could be paid to Gaul by
                    the ruling powers at Rome; but in 27 B.c. Augustus, now master of the Roman
                    world, took measures to Romanize it thoroughly. The old division into four
                    provinces was retained, and made subservient to administrative purposes. The
                    Provincia, however, received the name of Gallia Narbonnensis, from the Roman
                    town of Narbo (Narbonne); the boundaries of Aquitania were extended to the
                    Liger; what remained of Caesar’s Gauls were constituted the province of Gallia
                    Lugdunensis, so named from its capital, the new settlement of Lugdunum (Lyons);
                    and the northern division was called Gallia Belgica. This arrangement remained
                    nearly unchanged till the 4th century, when the four provinces were broken up
                    into seventeen, each with a capital and a number of other towns of more or less
                    importance, the names of which may be found in the larger geographical and
                    historical works that treat of the period. While an integral part of the Roman
                    empire Gaul often played no mean part in the contests that took place for the
                    imperial purple; and it was during one of these that Claudius Civilis, a
                    Romanized Gaul, made a gallant attempt to achieve the independence of his
                    country. His efforts, however, were not supported by the mass of the people, and
                    the movement was crushed by Vespasian. Perhaps the most noteworthy event of
                    those centuries was the insurrection of the Bagaudae or peasant banditti, in the
                    reign of Diocletian. Ruined and driven to despair by the exactions of the
                    imperial treasury, men scoured the country in marauding bands, plundering
                    wholesale. Though the revolt was suppressed, the lesson it ought to have taught
                    Rome was unheeded, and thus the seeds of future troubles remained in the soil.
                    Tn the declining days of the empire Gaul became a prey to the Visigoths in the
                    south, the Burgundians in the east, and the Franks in the north-east. When order
                    had arisen out of the confusion that ensued, the country was found to have taken
                    under a new name a still more conspicuous place in the political system of
                    Europe.</p>
