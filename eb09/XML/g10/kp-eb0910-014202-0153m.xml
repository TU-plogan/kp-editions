                    rend="italic">—</hi> The word “genealogy” (γενεαλογία), which occurs twice in
                    the New Testament (1 Tim. i. 4; Tit. iii. 9; compare also Heb. vii. 3, 6) in the
                    ordinary concrete sense of “pedigree” or “list of ancestors,” is of somewhat
                    frequent occurrence in the authorized version of the Old Testament scriptures,
                    but only in Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah, where the words b*∏l and which are
                    peculiar to that work, are invariably rendered “genealogy” and “to reckon by
                    genealogy.” This translation, however, is of somewhat doubtful accuracy; for,
                    whatever the original meaning of the root β ’ ∏) may have been,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Ewald <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gesch. d. V. Isr.</hi> i. 261, c∕. <hi rend="italic">Alt.</hi>
                    363), it meant properly “to count.” In the LXX. the Hithpael is rendered
                    differently in each passage where it occurs; <hi rend="italic"
                    >lγeι&gt;ιaλoγhθη</hi> is only once given. In Ezra ii. 62 the translation is
                    γpα≠⅛v <hi rend="italic">abrων oi μιθωeσeiμ</hi> (Vulg., scripturam genealogiae

                    (scripturam suam in censu). It may be added that the habit of taking a written
                    census of sections of the population, or even of the entire nation, was
                    obviously not unfamiliar to the Jews. This appears from numerous indications in
                    the earlier historical books, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Num. i. 18, where the
                    word (used here only) is ∙∏i)Γ)*), as well as in Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah.
                    Compare also Ezek. xiii. 9 and Ps. lxxxvii. 6.</p></note> there seems to be no
                    room for doubt that the noun and the verb connected with it were used in later
                    Hebrew simply to denote respectively the roll and the act of registration; and
                    that the “book” alluded to in Neh. vii. <hi rend="italic">5</hi> (in A. V.
                    “register of the genealogy”) was genealogical only in so far as the individuals
                    registered in it were classified according to their “houses,” “families,” and
                    “tribes.” While a catalogue of this sort was admirably fitted to be a permanent
                    record of tribal relations in Israel, as these subsisted at the time of its
                    compilation, there is not any reason to suppose that it made any attempt to
                    trace them through previous generations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>When, for example, we read in 1 Chr. vii. 6, 7 that Benjamin
                    had three sons (Bela, Becher, and Jediael); in viii. 1, 2 that he had-five
                    (Bela, Ashbel, Aharah, Nohah, and Rapha); in Numb, xxvi. 38 again that he had
                    five, but that their names were Belah, Ashbel, Ahiram, Shu-pham, and Ilupham;
                    and, finally, in Gen. xlvi. 21 that they numbered ten “souls” (Bela, Becher,
                    Ashbel, Gera, Naaman,Ehi, Rosh, Muppirn, Huppim, and Ard); or when the
                    descendants of Bela are variously-given, in 1 Chr. vii. 7 as Ezbon, Uzzi,
                    Uzziel, Jerimoth, and Iri; in 1 Chr. viii. 3-5, as Addar, Gera, Abihud, Abisbua,
                    Naaman, Ahoah, Gera, Shephuphan, and Iluram; and in Numb, xxvi. 40 as Ard and
                    Naaman, the simple explanation (after all due allowance for corruptions in the
                    text has been made) seems to be, that in the course of a long history the
                    Benjamite tribe included a varying number of families or clans with varying
                    names. Similar instances might be indefinitely multiplied. It ought to be added,
                    however, that criticism has not yet by any means completed its task on the book
                    of Chronicles in its genealogical bearings. See Wellhausen, <hi rend="italic"

                    ∏∏√i∏ (A. V. “generations;” Gen. ii. 4; v. 1; vi. 9; x. 1, &amp;c.; Éx. vi. 16,
                    19, &amp;c.; Num. iii. 1) so frequently met with in some other canonical books,
                    and so specially characteristic of the first book of the Pentateuch as
                    apparently to have suggested to the Alexandrian translators its distinctive name
                    of γ⅛eσcs. These begin with the antediluvian period, and indeed with “the
                    generations (or genealogy) of the heavens and of the earth.” The descendants of
                    Adam are traced through the lines of Cain and of Seth respectively to the
                    seventh and to the ninth generation. In the two lists the frequent similarity of
                    the names has not escaped observation; nor has the symmetry of the numbers (in
                    one case, a series of seven, the seventh branching into three; in the other a
                    series of ten, in which the seventh is peculiarly prominent, while the tenth
                    branches into three). The very ancient tradition which they embody is not at
                    present so generally believed to convey actual personal history as once it was,
                    but by those who view them as more or less ideal in their character their
                    significance has been very variously estimated,—some seeing in them the survival
                    of ancient myths, perhaps solar in their character; others interpreting them as
                    representing successive dynasties, or immigrations, or stages of culture within
                    a given area in prehistoric times; while such interpreters as Philo allegorize
                    them in a purely spiritual sense. The same differences of view find expression
                    when the genealogies of the immediately post-diluvian period come to be
                    considered. In Gen. xi. a series of nine generations (or, according to the LXX.,
                    ten) from Shem to Abraham is given; the symmetrical number again attracts
                    notice, and in the list some names at least can be identified as having belonged
                    to special nationalities; Arphaxad, for example, is probably equivalent to the
                    Arrhapachitis of Ptolemy (vi. 1). That this “genealogy” was in intention
                    ethnographical rather than personal finds confirmation from the expansion which
                    it receives in the very interesting sketch of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >genealogia</hi><hi rend="italic">universalis in</hi> Gen. x., where the sons of
                    Shem, besides Arphaxad, are said to have been Elam, Asshur, Lud, and Aram, while
                    from Aram were descended Uz, Hui, Gether, and Mash or Meshech (compare 1 Chron.
                    i. 17); and again, among the sons of Joktan, the (younger) brother of Peleg, are
                    found Hazarmaveth, Sheba, Ophir, and Havilah. Throughout Gen. x., indeed, a
                    thorough consciousness of a purely ethnographical purpose is manifest, and in
                    many instances the device of using personal names to convey ethnological
                    statements is entirely dropped (Gen. X. 13, 14, 16-18). Historians and critics
                    are not yet entirely at one as to the view which ought to be taken of the
                    genealogies which begin with Abraham. As is well known, these follow the line of
                    Isaac, but give also the collateral lines of Ishmael and of the children of
                    Keturah, and again trace the descendants not only of Jacob but also of Esau; and
                    so much at least is unanimously held that, even if strictly historical so far as
                    the children of Israel are concerned, they cannot be supposed to be complete for
                    the centuries of the sojourn in Egypt. There seems no reason to doubt, however,
                    that the distribution into tribes (mtsp or 0'φΠE&gt;) families (∏i∏Ξ(^D) and
                    houses (∏⅛⅛∙"JΙ'3) lay at the basis of the organization of the Israelites from
                    the earliest period of their independent national life, so that at any given
                    time each man would be able to tell what house he belonged to, what other houses
                    belonged to the same family, and what other families belonged to the same tribe
                    with himself. There are indications of repeated censuses, in which the people
                    were systematically enrolled for fiscal and military purposes; but, on the other
                    hand, it must be said, that there seems to be no adequate evidence that the
                    Q'ΙP⅛5ζ or “officers,” so frequently mentioned in the Pentateuch, had functions
                    at all corresponding to those of a heralds’ college, if indeed it can be
                    regarded as made out that, they were scribes at all. The statements which are
                    continually made as to the unbroken continuity and exhaustive fulnes3 of the
                    genealogical records of the twelve tribes of Israel are not borne out by any
                    sober reading of the facts of history, as these have come down to us; and, even
                    in the case of the Aaronic and Davidic families, there are some circumstances
                    that warn against too absolute confidence in the strict literality of the lists
                    which have reached our hands. It is certain, indeed, that from the beginning of
                    the post-exile period (Ezr. ii. 62, Neh. vii. 64) great importance was attached
                    to purity of lineal descent in the case of priests; and even in the time of
                    Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Cont. Ap.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> i.
                    7) members of the priestly caste were in the habit of proving their legitimacy
                    by means of public documents, which he refers to as <hi rend="italic"
                    >^ηgοσlαι</hi> δeλτot, But a comparison of the pedigree (whether official or
                    personal) of Jehosadak (1 Chr. vi. 3-15; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Ezra vii. 1)
                    with the enumeration of Aaron’s successors in the high priesthood, as given by
                    Josephus and repeated in the <hi rend="italic">Seder Olam,</hi> suggests that,
                    for the period preceding the captivity at least, the materials for a complete
                    list must have been somewhat defective. That in the case of the house of David,
                    in like manner, some real uncertainty existed would seem to be a legitimate
                    inference, not only from the Chronicler’s obscurity, but also from the not
                    easily reconcilable discrepancy between the genealogies given in Mat. i. and in
                    Luke iii. And this is not inconsistent with the fact, of which there are many
                    indications in the New Testament (and even, though more faintly, in the Mishna),
                    that among the Jews the consciousness of tribal distinctions disappeared very
                    slowly. When Anna is represented as belonging to the tribe of Asher and
                    Elizabeth as a daughter of Aaron, Paul as a Benjamite and Barnabas as a Levite;
                    or when, as is vouched for by a not very late tradition, the “desposyni” in the
                    time of Domitian claimed to have the royal blood of David in their veins, it
                    would obviously be just as rash to infer (as Jerome seems to have done) that
                    every successive link in the long series of their genealogies was accurately
                    known to the persons themselves, or recognized by their contemporaries, as it
                    would be unscientific altogether to ignore the presumption arising out of the
                    very fact that tribal distinctions were asserted. With reference even to the
                    most undisputed of the Biblical genealogies, it is important to remember, in the
                    first place, that in them phrases implying sonship are not to be interpreted so
                    strictly as they would be with us; and, secondly, that, in order to aid the
                    memory by means of successions of symmetrical numbers, it was quite usual to
                    manipulate a long list by dropping or even by introducing names at
                    discretion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classical.—</hi> A passing reference only is needed to the
                    intricate genealogies of gods and sons of gods which form so conspicuous a
                    feature in classical literature. In every one of the numerous states into which
                    ancient Greece was divided there were aristocratic families who were accustomed
                    to claim descent, through eponymous heroes, from the primitive deities. Many of
                    these families were, as families, undoubtedly of great antiquity even at the
                    beginning of the historical period; and in several instances they continued to
                    maintain a conspicuous and separate existence for centuries. The element of
                    family pride is prominent in the poetry of the Megarian Theognis; and in an
                    inscription belonging to the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> we find a
                    member of the Spartan family of Gytheates represented as the thirty-ninth in
                    direct descent from the Dioscuri and the forty-first from Hercules. Even in
                    Athens, long after the constitution had become thoroughly democratic, some of
                    the clans continued to be known as ∈i½rατpιδαι; and Alcibiades, for example, as
                    a member of the phratria of the Eurysacidae, traced his origin through many
                    generations to Eurysaces, who was represented as having been the first of

                    however, whether such pedigrees as this were very seriously put forward by those
                    who claimed them; and it is certain that, almost along the whole line, they were
                    unsupported by evidence. We have the authority of Pollux (viii. 111) for stating
                    that the Athenian <hi rend="italic">γεuεa,</hi> of which there were thirty in
                    each <hi rend="italic">φpaτpla,</hi> were orgauized without any exclusive regard
                    being had to blood-relationship; they were constantly receiving accessions from
                    without; and the public written registers of births, adoptions, and the like do
                    not appear to have been preserved with such care as would have made it possible
                    to verify a pedigree for any considerable portion even of the strictly
                    historical period (see Schoemann, <hi rend="italic">Griechische

                    type="authorial"><p>All the earlier Greek historians appear to have constructed

                    and the Heraclidae, about the early settlements in Peloponnesus, and about those

                <p>The great antiquity of the early Roman (patrician) gentes is indisputable; and

                    >gentilitia</hi> is sufficiently illustrated by the fact that towards the close
                    of the republic there were not more than fifty patrician families (Dionys., i.
                    85). Yet eveiι in these it is obvious that, owing to the frequency of resort to
                    the well-recognized practice of adoption, while there was every guarantee for
                    the historical identity of the family, there was none (documents apart) for the
                    personal genealogy of the individual. There is no evidence that sufficient
                    records of pedigree were kept during the earlier centuries of the Roman
                    commonwealth. In later times, it is true, even plebeian families began to

                    to exhibit these in public on appropriate occasions. Under these imagines

                    inscribe on the wall their respective tituli, the relationship of each to each
                    being indicated by means of connecting lines; and thus arose the stemmata
                    gentilitia, which at a later time began to be copied into family records. In the
                    case of plebeian families (whose stemmata in no case went farther back than 366
                    B.C.), these written genealogies were probably trustworthy enough; but in the

                    of the Western empire almost invariably militated with great strength against
                    the maintenance of an aristocracy of birth; and from the time of Constantine the
                    dignity of patrician ceased to be hereditary.<note anchored="true"

                    for genealogizing, which has been and is a marked characteristic of all the
                    aristocracies of modern Europe, can be directly traced to the influence of
                    feudalism and the principles of hereditary privilege which that system, in its
                    later phases at least, so peculiarly encouraged. Along with the sharp separation
                    of those families which alone were regarded as capable of holding real property
                    or filling the higher offices of state, or indeed of engaging in any of what
                    were reckoned as the more ennobling pursuits of life, arose the necessity for
                    being able to determine with accuracy who were and who were not the persons
                    entitled by birth to take a place within the privileged caste. When, for
                    example, the practice arose of holding tournaments, in which no one was allowed
                    to take part who could not give evidence of gentle descent, the necessity for
                    the professional genealogist became at once apparent. It was not, however, until
                    about the end of the 15th century that the vanguard of the great army of writers
                    upon this fertile subject began to appear. It was perhaps natural that, finding
                    as they did the gulf of separation between noble and base to be so great as it
                    was, they should have leapt to the conclusion that it had existed from the
                    first; at all events their knowledge and their ignorance combined to support
                    them in their conjecture. As they forced their way up the stream of time,
                    indeed, they were met at a comparatively early stage by a great
                    barrier—consisting less in the paucity and inaccessibility of authentic
                    documents than in what one might almost call the fatal fact of the absence of
                    family names. Prior to the middle of the 11th century these were entirely
                    unknown; the documents speak merely of Eberhardus, Fridericus, Ernestus, and the
                    like, with at most the addition of the title. About 1050 began the custom of
                    using surnames, but it made way so very slowly that, even at the close of the
                    12th century, it had not diffused itself beyond the ranks of the higher
                    nobility, and throughout the 13th the old habit of self-designation by the
                    Christian name merely was still exemplified in a vast number of instances.<note

                    >Abriss der Genealogie,</hi> sec. 41 (1788). According to this author, there is
                    only one class of cases in which it is possible to trace a pedigree beyond the
                    11th century,—those cases, namely, where a family happens to have established a
                    fund for the deliverance of the souls of certain ancestors (Christian names
                    specified) from purgatory.</p></note> The difficulty, however, in an age when
                    the laws of evidence were so imperfectly understood, did not count for much with
                    the courtly genealogists of the 15th and following centuries. The insuperable
                    obstacle which barred their advance along the path of sober research only
                    furnished them with a pretext for all the sooner making their escape into the
                    region of imagination and conjecture, where no impediments occurred in tracing
                    the ascending series until the name of the first created person was reached. The
                    appended bibliography will help to make clear the degrees by which genealogists
                    have gradually been brought to confine themselves to the limits of the
                    verifiable. At present, if we understand by a genealogy a tabulated and, as far
                    as possible, an exhaustive statement of all the ramifications of a series of
                    human generations, and by genealogical science that branch of history which aims
                    at securing fulness and accuracy in the accounts men give of the antecedents of
                    families which have attained to distinction, the modern genealogist cannot but
                    be conscious that he occupies a comparatively narrow field, and one from which
                    the larger interests of mankind are daily further receding. In the more ancient
                    meaning of the word genealogy indeed, when it is used to denote that grander
                    task of the historian which consjsts in tracing the origin, not of privileged
                    families or castes merely, but of races and groups of races, and even of the
                    species itself, the subject is one that has an ever widening and deepening
                    significance; but in this sense it does not call for treatment apart from the
                    biological sciences.</p>

                    During recent years the stricter principles of criticism which have become
                    characteristics of all modern historical inv⅛gtigation have made themselves felt
                    in a very marked manner in the field of genealogical research. A wise scepticism
                    has been increasingly shown with regard to all assertions which had not the
                    support of adequate “diplomatic” evidence; and with the increased desire have
                    come enlarged facilities for consulting ancient documents, either directly or by
                    means of authentic reprints. So far as England is concerned, the improved
                    arrangements with regard to the public records, and the various publications of
                    the record commissioners, have brought the materials for a successful
                    prosecution of this and cognate branches of antiquarian science within the reach
                    of every zealous student; and although, in current <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peerages,</hi> assertions which probably had no origin but in vanity, and
                    certainly have no evidence except that of long unquestioned tradition, are still
                    perpetuated, such statements can mislead none except the very unsophisticated.
                    The principal and almost the only sources from which authentic family history
                    can be drawn are such documents as the. Domesday books; the chartularies, leiger
                    books, registers, necrologies, calendars, and chronicles of the various
                    monasteries, records which convey both directly and indirectly a vast amount of
                    information as to the pedigrees of founders and patrons; also the tournament and
                    crusade rolls sometimes found in these establishments; the various sorts of
                    Chartae Antiquae, such as title deeds and enrolments in Chancery and other
                    courts of justice; the books and rolls which record the returns to the
                    successive inquisitions made into the state of the “Knights’ Fees” which were
                    granted at the time of the Norman Conquest; the Placita, in which are recorded
                    decisions of parliament and other courts; the Rotuli, including charter rolls,
                    patent rolls, pipe rolls, and many others; the Inquisitiones post mortem,
                    sometimes inaccurately termed escheats; the records of heralds’ visitations;
                    monumental inscriptions, coats of arms, seals, &amp;c. These sources are
                    indicated λvith considerable fulness and discrimination in Grimaldi’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Origines Gcnealogicoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">or the Sources where
                    English Genealogies may be traced from the Conquest to the Present Time</hi>
                    (1828), and, after him, by Sims in the <hi rend="italic">Manual for the
                    Genealogist, Topographer, Antiquary, and Legal Professor,</hi> 1856.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Grimaldi, in
                    1828 there were 294 peers, exclusive of the royal family. Of these thirty-five
                    claimed to have traced their descent to beyond the Conquest, forty-nine to a
                    date prior to the year 1100, twenty-nine to the 12th century, thirty-two to the
                    13th, twenty-six to the 14th, seventeen to the 15th, twenty-six to the 16th, and
                    thirty to the 17th. In the case of forty-five noblemen no satisfactory
                    conclusion could be drawn as to the commencement of their pedigree. The pedigree
                    of the Percys is one cf the most full and complete, genealogies of the kingdom.
                    In Scotland the house of Mar is probably that which can at once carry its
                    nobility to the remotest period (1093), and authenticate it by the best
                    evidence.</p></note></p>
                <p>The earliest printed “British Peerage” was that of Milles, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Cataloglie of Honor,</hi> published in folio in 1610; but Camden’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> (1586) also contained many genealogies. Among
                    recent works the best known are those of J. and J. B. Burke <hi rend="italic">(A
                    Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United
                    Kingdom,</hi> 1822; 40th ed., 1877), of Lodge <hi rend="italic">(The Genealogy
                    of the Existing British Peerage,</hi> 1832-33; 48th cd., 1879), of Dod, and of
                    Debrett; but the number of publications (inclusive of those of the London
                    Genealogical and Historical Society) which have been, and continue to be, issued
                    on this attractive subject is very great. For a bibliography approaching to
                    completeness reference may be made to the privately printed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogue of Works on the Peerage and Baronetage of England, Scotland, and
                    Ireland,</hi> prepared by Sir C. G. Young (1827), to Moule’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca Heraldica</hi> (1822), or to Sims’s <hi rend="italic">Manual for
                    Genealogists.</hi> In any list, however brief, the names of Dugdale <hi
                    rend="italic">(The Baronage of England,</hi> 1675-76) and of Collins (4 <hi
                    rend="italic">Peerage of England,</hi> 1709; <hi rend="italic">The English
                    Baronage,</hi> of which only the first volume was ever completed, 1727) deserve
                    a special place. The works of Sir R. Douglas on <hi rend="italic">The Peerage of
                    Scotland</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Baronage of Scotland</hi> appeared
                    respectively in 1764 and 1796; that of John Lodge, on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Peerage of Ireland,</hi> in 1754. On the knightage of Great Britain and Ireland
                    the most accessible writers are again Burke and Dod; but the work of Sir N. H.
                    Nicolas <hi rend="italic">(A History of the Orders of Knighthood of the British
                    Empire,</hi> 4 vols, fol., 1842) is of more importance. As being somewhat of an
                    innovation in genealogical literature, Burke’s work on the commoners of Great
                    Britain and Ireland may be mentioned here <hi rend="italic">(A Genealogical and
                    Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland enjoying
                    territorial possessions or high special rank but uninvested with heritable
                    honours,</hi> 1833-38).</p>
                <p>For the purposes of genealogical research in the United States of America one
                    society at least has been formed, “The New England Historical and Genealogical
                    Society,” under the auspices of which an annual <hi rend="italic">Register</hi>
                    is published. Among numerous other publications bearing upon this subject may be
                    mentioned J. F. Holgate’s <hi rend="italic">American Genealogy</hi> (1851),
                    Whitmore’s <hi rend="italic">American Genealogy</hi> (1868), Webster’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Genealogy</hi> (1877), and Thomas’s <hi rend="italic">Genealogical
