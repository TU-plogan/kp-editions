                <p><label type="entry">GEOGRAPHY</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Introduction.</hi><hi>
                    GEOGRAPHY</hi> is the science which describes the earth, the term being derived
                    from two Greek words <hi rend="italic">γη,</hi> the earth, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >γράφω,</hi> to write. By means of geography the surface of the earth is
                    delineated and described, boundaries are defined, areas are exactly measured,
                    and the relative positions of places are determined. Geography thus embraces a
                    wide range of subjects, and it has been found necessary to divide its study into
                    several distinct sections.</p>
                <p>I. Comparative Geography traces the history of discovery, and records the changes
                    which have taken place in land and sea in historic times.</p>
                <p>II. Mathematical Geography explains the figure, magnitude, and motion of the
                    earth, teaches how to determine the positions of places on its surface, and
                    shows how the whole or any portion of the earth may, on the principles of
                    projection, be delineated on a map or chart.</p>
                <p>III. Physical Geography is the description of the actual state of the earth’s
                    surface in its three great divisions—land, sea, and air.</p>
                <p>IV. Political Geography describes the earth as divided into countries, occupied
                    by various nations, and improved by human art and industry.</p>
                <p>The following article is limited to a view of the progress of geographical
                    discovery, an explanation of the principles of mathematical geography, and a
                    synopsis of physical geography. For details relating to political geography the
                    reader must consult the descriptive articles under their particular
                    headings.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">View of the Progress of Geographical Discovery.</hi></p>
                <p>Four main causes have led to geographical discovery and exploration, namely,
                    commercial intercourse between different countries, the operations of war,
                    pilgrimages and missionary zeal, and in later times the pursuit of knowledge for
                    its own sake, which is the highest of all motives.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians are the earliest commercial people of whose discoveries we have
                    any correct accounts. They first explored the shores of the Mediterranean, and
                    eventually extended their voyages through the Straits of Gibraltar, and visited
                    the western shores of Spain and Africa, planting colonies and opening wider
                    fields for their commerce by instructing the natives in their arts and
                    improvements. They also monopolized the trade with India; and their chief
                    emporium, the rich city of Tyre, was the centre whence the products of the East
                    and West were distributed. The trade of the West was brought from the port
                    called Tarshish in Scripture, which is probably identical with Carthage, where
                    the ships arrived from Spain, Africa, and distant Britain. Concerning the far
                    eastern land reached by the Phoenicians, called Ophir in Scripture, there has
                    been much dispute. The voyage to Ophir, we are told, occupied three years
                    thither and homeward, and the cargo consisted of gold, ivory, apes, peacocks,
                    and “algum” wood (1 Kings ix. 26, and X. 11). The following reasons lead to the
                    conclusion that Ophir was the Malabar coast of India. In the Hebrew the word for
                    apes is <hi rend="italic">koph</hi> (without any etymology in Semitic tongues),
                    in Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">kafi.</hi> Ivory in Hebrew is <hi rend="italic"
                    >shen-hal&gt;bim∙,</hi> in Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">ibha</hi> is an elephant.
                    Peacocks is in Hebrew <hi rend="italic">tokki-im</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >togei,</hi> the name still used on the Malabar coast, derived from the
                    Sanskrit. Algum wood, or almug, is corrupted from <hi rend="italic">υalgu</hi>
                    (ka), sandal wood from Malabar. Thus the Phoenicians were the first great
                    carriers of the ancient world, extending their commercial operations from their
                    central mart of Tyre on the Syrian coast to the tin-yielding isles of the
                    Cassiterides in the far west, and to the ports of India in the east.</p>
                <p>The great Phoenician colony of Carthage retained in full vigour the commercial
                    spirit of the parent state. Tbe Carthaginians traded on the coasts of Spain and
                    Gaul, and extended their discoveries southwards along the coast of Africa, and
                    to the Fortunate Islands, now known as the Canaries. Herodotus relates how the
                    Phoenicians, setting sail from the Red Sea, made their way to the south, and
                    when autumn approached they drew their vessels to land, sowed a crop, and waited
                    till it was grown, when they reaped it and again put to sea. Having spent two
                    years in this manner, in the third year they reached the pillars of Hercules and
                    returned to Egypt. But the most celebrated voyage of antiquity, undertaken for
                    the purpose of discovery, was the expedition under Hanno, fitted out by the
                    senate of Carthage with the view of attempting the complete survey of the
                    western coast of Africa. Hanno is said, in the <hi rend="italic">Periplus
                    Hannonis,</hi> to have set sail with a fleet of 60 vessels, and the extent of
                    his voyage has been variously estimated as reaching to the river Nun, to a
                    little beyond Sierra Leone, and even as far as the Gulf of Benin. Another famous
                    navigator, who sailed from the Carthaginian colony of Massilia (Marseilles) in
                    about 320 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was Pytheas. He steered northwards
                    along the coasts of Spain and Gaul, sailed round the island of Albion, and
                    stretching still further to the north, he discovered an island known to the
                    ancients as <hi rend="italic">Ultima Thule,</hi> which may possibly have been
                    the Shetland Isles.</p>
                <p>The conquests of Alexander the Great, by making known the vast empire of Persia,
                    materially enlarged the bounds of geographical knowledge. Although the course of
                    his expedition was mainly by land, the mind of the conqueror was also intent on
                    commerce and maritime discovery. In 327 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Alexander
                    led an army of Greeks down the valley of the Cabul river into the Punjab, and
                    his expedition <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n187/mode/1up"

                    of the Indus to that of the Tigris, aud in opening direct intercourse between
                    Grecian and Hindu civilization. The Greeks who accompanied Alexander were
                    accurate observers, and described the towns and villages, the products and the
                    aspect of the country, with care. The conqueror resolved to return through
                    Gedrosia (the modern Baluchistan), but he also intended to open the trade by sea
                    between Europe and India, aud his general Nearchus, a native of Crete,
                    volunteered to lead this famous voyage of discovery. His fleet consisted of 30
                    galleys containing 2000 men. On October 2, 326 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    the fleet of Nearchus left the Indus, and the anchorages each night are
                    carefully recorded. On the 17th of December Cape Jask was doubled and the fleet
                    entered the Persian Gulf, and on the 9th of February it was at the mouth of the
                    Kanin. Nearchus rejoined Alexander at Susa; and the conqueror himself embarked
                    in the fleet and ascended the Tigris to Opis, above Baghdad. He then ordered his
                    successful admiral to prepare another expedition forjhe circumnavigation of
                    Arabia; but unfortunately the great conqueror died at Babylon in 324 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the fleet was dispersed.</p>
                <p>The dynasties founded by Alexander’s generals, Seleucus, Antiochus, aud Ptolemy,
                    encouraged the same spirit of enterprise which their master had so carefully
                    fostered, and extended geographical knowledge in several directions. Seleucus
                    Nicator established the Greco-Bactrian empire, and continued the intercourse
                    with India. The most authentic information respecting the Gangetic valley was
                    supplied by Megasthenes, an ambassador sent by Seleucus, who reached the remote
                    city of Patali-putra, the modern Patna, on the Ganges.</p>
                <p>The Ptolemies of Egypt showed equal anxiety to extend the bounds of geographical
                    knowledge. Ptolemy Euergetes sent an expedition which discovered Abyssinia, and
                    fitted out a fleet under Eudoxus to explore the Arabian Sea. After two
                    successful voyages, Eudoxus left the Egyptian service, and proceeded to Cadiz
                    with the object of fitting out an expedition for the purpose of African
                    discovery; and we learn from Strabo that the veteran explorer made at least two
                    voyages southward along the coast of Africa. The Ptolemies sent fleets annually
                    from their Red Sea ports of Berenice and Myos Hormus to Arabia, as well as to
                    ports on the coasts of Africa and India.</p>
                <p>The Romans did not encourage navigation and commerce with the same ardour as
                    their predecessors; still the luxury of Rome, which gave rise to demands for the
                    varied products of -all the countries of the known world, led to an active trade
                    both by ships and caravans. But it was the military genius of Rome, and the
                    ambition for universal empire, which led not only to the discovery but also to
                    the survey of nearly all Europe, and of large tracts in Asia and Africa. Every
                    new war produced a new survey and itinerary of the countries which were
                    conquered. In the height of their power the Romans had surveyed and explored all
                    the coasts of the Mediterranean, Italy, Greece, the Balkan peninsula, Spain,
                    Gaul, western Germany, and Britain; but the eastern parts of Germany, Denmark,
                    Sweden, and Russia were still unknown regions. In Africa their empire included
                    Egypt, Carthage, Numidia, and Mauritania. In Asia they held Asia Minor and
                    Syria, had sent expeditions into Arabia, and were acquainted with the more
                    distant countries formerly overrun by Alexander, namely, Persia, Scythia,
                    Bactria, and India. Roman intercourse with India especially led to the extension
                    of geographical knowledge.</p>
                <p>The first Roman who undertook a journey to India was solely influenced by the
                    desire to acquire a knowledge of the people and their doctrines. This was
                    Apollonius, a resident at Antioch, who set out towards the close of the first
                    half century of our era. He and his attendants, Daιnis and Philostratus, reached
                    the Indus, and journeying across the Punjab, came to a bronze pillar with the
                    inscription “Here Alexander halted”; but it is doubtful whether the party
                    advanced as far the Ganges. It was, however, in the reigns of Severus and his
                    immediate successors that Roman intercourse with India was at its height.</p>
                <p>In all time, while warriors and explorers extended the area of geographical
                    knowledge, there have been students who have striven to systematize and put into
                    due form the accumulated information. From the first it was perceived that a
                    knowledge of localities could not be attained without some notion of their
                    relative positions, and their distances from each other. Consequently the
                    attempts to establish fixed principles on which the surface of the earth, or any
                    portion of it, could be delineated, were almost coeval with the earliest voyages
                    of discovery.</p>
                <p>The first attempt made to determine the position of places appears to have
                    depended on the division of the earth into “climates,”distinguished by the.
                    species of animalsand plants produced in each. This method, however, was soon
                    abandoned for another, which consisted in observing at places the length of the
                    longest and shortest days by means of a “guomon.” An upright pillar of a known
                    height being erected on a level pavement, by observing the lengths of the
                    meridian shadows the progress of the sun from tropic to tropic was traced. The
                    most ancient observation with the gnomon is that of Pytheas, in the days of
                    Alexander the Great, who observed at the summer solstice at Massilia that the
                    length of the meridian shadow was to the height of the gnomon as 213⅜ to 600, an
                    observation which makes the meridian altitude of the sun at Marseilles on that
                    day 70° 27'. The merit of the invention of the gnomon in Greece is ascribed to
                    the astronomical school of Miletus; but there is reason to believe that this
                    method of observation was invented in Egypt, and that Thales carried the
                    knowledge of it into Greece. This was the first step towards connecting
                    geography with astronomy; and little further advance was made until the
                    establishment of the famous astronomical school of Alexandria,</p>
                <p>Eratosthenes (276—196 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> was the first who reduced
                    geography to a regular system, and laid its foundations on clear and solid
                    principles. Under the patronage of the Ptolemies he had access to all the
                    materials collected by Alexander and his generals. The doctrine of the
                    sphericity of the earth had by this time been adopted, and the aim of his
                    labours was to delineate, in conformity with this principle, the known parts of
                    the earth’s surface. Founding his system on the use of the gnomon, he supposed a
                    line to be traced through certain places, in all of which the longest day was
                    known to be exactly of the same length. Such a line would evidently be a
                    parallel to the equator. This first parallel passed through Rhodes, and was ever
                    afterwards adopted as the basis of ancient maps. Eratosthenes continued his work
                    by tracing other parallels at certain intervals from the first, one through
                    Alexandria, another through Syene, a third through Meroe. He also traced, at
                    right, angles to these, a meridian passing through Rhodes and Alexandria,
                    southwards to Syene and Meroe. As the progress which he thus made towards the
                    completion of what he had so skilfully conceived naturally tended to enlarge his
                    ideas concerning geographical science, he attempted next to determine the
                    circumference of the globe by the actual measurement of a segment of one of its
                    great circles. Posidonius made another measurement of an arc of the meridian
                    between Rhodes and Alexandria about 170 years <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    afterwards; but the amount of error in the calculations of Eratosthenes and
                    Posidonius is uncertain, for want of a knowledge of the true length of the
                    stadium in which their results are expressed. The ancients made their first
                    meridian<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0188-0177"/> at the sacred promontory of Iberia, and their
                    longitudinal error increased rapidly as they advanced eastwards. This is no
                    doubt due to their longitudes being based entirely on distances calculated in
                    the itineraries of travellers. Such data of course produced very great
                    distortions in the representations given of the countries on the surface of the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>The improvements introduced by Eratosthenes were perfected in principle by
                    Hipparchus, who flourished from 160 to 135 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Ho was
                    the first astronomer who undertook the arduous task of making a catalogue of the
                    stars and fixing their relative positions. His object was to transmit to
                    posterity a knowledge of the state of the heavens at the period of his
                    observations. The extremities of the imaginary axis round which the heavens
                    perform their diurnal revolutions suggest two fixed points by which the position
                    of the great circle of the celestial sphere, called the celestial equator, is
                    determined. If a great circle be supposed to pass through these points and any
                    star, the position of the star will be ascertained if we measure in degrees and
                    parts of a degree the arc of the meridian circle intercepted between th? star
                    and the equator, and also the arc of the equator intercepted between a given
                    point in it and the meridian circle passing through the star. Upon this
                    principle Hipparchus arranged the stars according to their places in the
                    heavens; and the great improvement which he introduced into geography consisted
                    in this, that he applied to the determining of the position of any point on the
                    surface of the earth the same rule which he had introduced in the arrangement of
                    the constellations. Thus he furnished the means of ascertaining the relative
                    positions of places with far greater accuracy than could be obtained from
                    itinerary measurements. He made a considerable number of observations for
                    latitude, and pointed out how longitudes might be determined by observing the
                    eclipses of the sun and moon.</p>
                <p>The most ancient maps that have reached modern times are those which illustrate
                    Ptolemy’s geography, but an earlier map made for Aristagoras, king of Miletus
                    (500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> is minutely described by Herodotus.
                    Ptolemy composed his system of geography in the reign of Antoninus Pius, about
                    150 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His materials consisted of all the
                    itineraries prepared by the Romans, proportions of the height of the gnomon and
                    its shadow at the time of the equinoxes and solstices taken by different
                    astronomers, calculations founded on the length of the longest days, and various
                    reports of travellers and navigators. Ptolemy undertook the task of comparing
                    and reducing this mass of crude material into one system, following the
                    principles laid down by Hipparchus, but which had been neglected during the two
                    centuries and a half since his time, even by such men as Strabo and Pliny. In
                    Ptolemy’s work we find for the first time the mathematical principle of the
                    construction of maps, as well as of several projections of the sphere.</p>
                <p>The errors of Ptolemy arose from defective information, and the want in many
                    instances, and especially as regards the remote parts of the then known world,
                    of astronomical observations. He adopted the measure of a degree at 500 stadia;
                    and the latitudes along the chief parallel of Rhodes, as first laid down by
                    Eratosthenes, are tolerably correct. But the elements for determining the
                    longitudes were still derived from itineraries, and errors in latitude
                    accumulated to the north and south of the central parallel.</p>
                <p>Although Ptolemy was the first scientific geographer whose work has come down to
                    us in a complete form, the earlier labours of Strabo, who lived in the reigns of
                    Augustus and Tiberius, are of equal value, and we fortunately possess the whole
                    of his 17 books. Pliny also devoted two books of his extensive work to
                    geography; and the scattered geographical notices of other ancient writers were
                    collected into one work of four volumes by Hudson, and published between 1698
                    and 1712, with notes by Dodwell. From the days of Ptolemy to the revival of
                    letters in Europe, little was done towards the scientific improvement of
                    geographical science, though military and commercial enterprise led to a great
                    extension of knowlege of the earth’s surface.</p>
                <p>After the dissolution of the Roman empire, Constantinople became the last refuge
                    of arts, taste, and elegance; while Alexandria continued to be the emporium
                    whence were imported the commodities of the East. The em peror Justinian sent
                    two Nestorian monks to China, who returned with eggs of the silkworm concealed
                    in a hollow cane, and thus silk manufactures were established in the
                    Peloponnesus and the Greek Islands. It was also in the reign of Justinian that
                    Cosmas Indicopleustes, an Egyptian merchant, made several voyages, and
                    afterwards composed his <hi rend="italic">Topographia Christiana,</hi>
                    containing a particular description of India. The great outburst of Mahometan
                    conquest was followed by an Arabian civilization, having its centres at Cordova
                    and Baghdad, in connexion with which geography again received a share of
                    attention.</p>
                <p>From the 9th to the 13th century intelligent Mahometan travellers wrote accounts
                    of what they had seen and heard in distant lands, which have been handed down to
                    us; while the caliphs of Baghdad encouraged the study of geographical
                    science.</p>
                <p>The caliph Al-Mamûn, the worthy son and successor of Hârûn er-Rashid, caused an
                    Arabic version of Ptolemy’s great astronomical work (2wταfιs <hi rend="italic"
                    >yeylστf)</hi> to be made, which is known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almagest,</hi> the word being nothing more than the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >p(ylστη</hi> with the Arabic article <hi rend="italic">al</hi> prefixed. The
                    geography of Ptolemy is also constantly referred to by Arab writers. The learned
                    men under Al-Mamûn began to apply themselves to astronomy in 813 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> following the system of Ptolemy; and the first
                    observations that are properly their own were made by El-Bâthany in Mesopotamia,
                    of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, in 882 A.D. The Arab astronomers also
                    measured a degree on the plains of Mesopotamia, and Ibn Yûnus observed three
                    eclipses at Cairo. The caliph’s librarian, Abu Jafar Muhammad Ben Musa, wrote a
                    geographical work, now unfortunately lost, entitled <hi rend="italic">Rasm el
                    Arsi (“A</hi> Description of the World”), which is often referred to by
                    subsequent writers as having been composed on the model of that of Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>The earliest Arabian traveller whose observations have come down to us is the
                    merchant Sulaiman, who embarked in the Persian Gulf and made several voyages to
                    India and China, in the middle of the 9th century. Sulaiman’s information was
                    supplemented by that collected by another writer named Abu Zaid; and, so far as
                    India is concerned, this work is the most important that we possess before the
                    grand epoch of the discoveries of Marco Polo. Next to Sulaiman followed the
                    voyages of Sindbad the Sailor, whose narrative, though inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> also forms a distinct and separate work,
                    which was translated into French by Μ. Langlès in 1814. Baron Walckenaer
                    ascribes to the voyages of Sindbad a date about coincident with those of
                    Sulaiman. Ibn Khurdadra, a fire-worshipper converted to Islam, who died in 912
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> also wrote an account of India. Al Masudi, a
                    great traveller who knew all the countries between Spain and China, described
                    the plains, mountains, and seas, the dynasties and peoples, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Murûju-l</hi><hi rend="italic">Zahab</hi> (“Meadows of Gold ”). He
                    died in 956. His contemporaries were Al Istakhri, who travelled through all the
                    Mahometan countries, and wrote his <hi rend="italic">Book of Climates</hi> in
                    950, and Ibn Haukal, whose <hi rend="italic">Book of Roads and Kingdoms</hi> was
                    written in 976. Al Idrisi was born at Ceuta, and after travelling far and wide,
                    settled in Sicily, where he was induced by Roger II., the Norman king, to write
                    his book <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n189/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0189-0178"/> on geography, the full title of which is <hi
                    rend="italic">The Delight of those who seek to wander through the Legions of the
                    World.</hi> Finally Al Kazwini, who was a compiler from the works of Istakhri
                    and Ibn Haukal in about 1263, brings us down to the times when the Italian
                    explorers began to make known the vast realms of Asia to the people of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>The Mongol and Turkish dynasties, which succeeded each other after the fall of
                    the Arabian caliphs, also produced rulers who encouraged geographical science.
                    Philosophers assembled at the court of Hulaku Khan (1253-1264) at Maraghah in
                    the north of Persia; and his friend Nâsiru-’d-Dîn was the most famous astronomer
                    of the age. He constructed the tables known as the Tables of the Hkhany, which
                    corrected some important errors in the former mode of adjusting the commencement
                    of the new year. Nearly two centuries later, in 1446, Ulugh Begh, of the house
                    of Timur, succeeded to the throne of Samarkand, and under his auspice3 the
                    famous tables called “Zij Ulugh Begh” were composed. They continued to be
                    authorities for long afterwards, and even Kinneir, in determining the latitudes
                    of places in Persia, often quotes the tables of Ulugh Begh.</p>
                <p>The Northmen of Denmark and Norway, who were the terror of all the coasts of
                    Europe, and who established themselves in England and Ireland, in France and
                    Sicily, were also great promoters of geographical discovery during the darkest
                    period of the Middle Ages. The Northmen were far from being always vikings, bent
                    only on rapine and plunder. They were very often peaceful merchants. King Alfred
                    sent Ulfsten and the Norwegian Ottar on voyages of discovery towards the White
                    Sea; and the Scandinavian merchants brought the products of India to England and
                    Ireland. From the 8th to the 11th century a commercial route from India passed
                    through Kharism and Novgorod to the Baltic, and immense quantities of Arabian
                    coins have been found in Sweden, and particularly in the island of Gothland,
                    which are preserved at Stockholm. Five-sixths of them were from the mints of the
                    Samanian dynasty, which reigned in Khorasan and Transoxiana from about 900 to
                    1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It was the trade with the East that
                    originally gave importance to the city of Visby in Gothland.</p>
                <p>In the end of the 9th century Iceland was colonized from Norway; and in 985 the
                    intrepid viking Erik, surnamed the Red, discovered Greenland, and induced some
                    of his Icelandic countrymen to settle on its inhospitable shores. In 986 young
                    Bjorni, son of one of Erik’s comrades, sailed from Iceland to join his father in
                    Greenland, but shaped his course too far to the south, and was the discoverer of
                    America. He sailed along the coasts of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Nova
                    Scotia, before he eventually found the fjord on the Greenland coast where his
                    father dwelt. Then Leif, the son of Erik, bought the ship from young Bjorni and
                    made another voyage of discovery, and once more the coast of America was
                    visited. Other expeditions were undertaken by his two brothers, intercourse was
                    kept up between Greenland and Norway, and the saga of Thorfinn tells us of other
                    voyages to America. The last that was heard of the Norwegian colonies in
                    Greenland was in a brief of Pope Nicolas V. in 1448, where it is stated that, 30
                    years before, the settlements had been destroyed <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    by the attacks of savages. Two noble Venetians, Nicolo and Antonio Zeno, who
                    were in the service of the prince of the Faroe Islands in the end of the 13th
                    century, recorded their observations respecting the Norse colonies. Antonio
                    actually went to Greenland, and heard of the visits of fishermen to two parts of
                    North America called Estotiland and Drogeo.</p>
                <p>At length the long period of barbarism which accompanied and followed the fall of
                    the Roman empire drew to a close in Europe. The crusades had a very favourable
                    influence on the intellectual state of the Western nations. Interesting regions,
                    known only by the scant reports of pilgrims, were made the objects of attention
                    and research; while religous zeal, and the hope of gain, combined with motives
                    of mere curiosity, induced several persons to travel by land into remote regions
                    of the East, far beyond the countries to which the operations of the crusaders
                    extended. Among these was Benjamin of Tudela, who set out from Spain in 1160,
                    travelled by land to Constantinople, and having visited India and some of the
                    eastern islands, returned to Europe by way of Egypt after an absence of 13
                    years.</p>
                <p>Christian missionary zeal was another motive for exploration. John of Plano
                    Carpini in Perugia, a Frauciscan monk, was the head of one of the missions
                    despatched by Pope Innocent to call the chief and people of the Tatars to a
                    better mind. He reached the headquarters of Batu, on the Volga, in February
                    1246; and, after some stay, went on to the camp of the great khan near
                    Karakorum, and returned safely in the autumn of 1247. A few years afterwards, a
                    Fleming named Rubruquis was sent by St Louis on a mission to the Tatar chiefs,
                    and wrote a very interesting narrative. He entered the Black Sea in May 1253,
                    visited Batu and the court of the great khan Mangu near Karakorum, and got back
                    to Antioch about the end of June 1255. Rubruquis had the merit of being the
                    first modern traveller who gave a correct account of the Caspian Sea, He
                    ascertained that it had no outlet. At nearly the same time Hayton, king of
                    Armenia, made a journey to Karakorum in 1254, by a route far to the north of
                    that followed by Carpini and Rubruquis. He was treated with honour and
                    hospitality, and returned by way of Otrar, Samarkand, and Tabriz, to his own
                    territory. The curious narrative of King Hayton was translated by Klaproth.</p>
                <p>While the republics of Italy, and above all the state of: Venice, were engaged in
                    distributing the jewels, the spices, 1 and the fine cloths of India over the
                    Western world, it was impossible that motives of curiosity, as well as a desire
                    of commercial advantage, should not be awakened to such a degree as to impel
                    some to brave all the obstacles and dangers to be encountered in visiting those
                    remote countries. Among these were Nicolo and Maffeo Polo, two brothers who
                    traded with the East and visited Tatary. The recital of their travels fired the
                    youthful imagination of young Marco Polo, the son of Nicolo, and he set out for
                    the court of Kublai Khan, with his father and uncle, in 1265. After a journey of
                    three years and a half they reached Yeu-king, near the spot where Peking now
                    stands, and young Marco· was enrolled among the attendants of honour of the
                    Grand Khan. During the seventeen years that he remained in this service, Marco
                    Polo was employed on important missions; and besides what he learnt from his own
                    observation, he collected from others much information concerning countries
                    which he did not visit. He returned to Europe possessed of a vast store of
                    knowledge respecting the eastern parts of the world, and, being afterwards made
                    a prisoner by the Genoese, he dictated the narrative of his travels during his
                    captivity. The work of Marco Polo is the most valuable narrative of travels that
                    appeared during the Middle Ages, and its latest and ablest editor truly says,
                    “All other travellers of that time are but stars of a low magnitude beside the
                    full orb of Marco Polo.”</p>
                <p>Still these minor orbs continued to do useful geographical work, while striving
                    to spread the truths of the Gospel. Among them were John of Monte Corvino, a
                    Franciscan monk, Andrew of Perugia, John Marignioli, and Friar Jordanus, who
                    visited the west coast of India, and above all Friar Odoric of Pordenone. Odoric
                    set out on his travels in about 1318, and was in western India and northern
                    China between 1321 and 1328, dying in 1331. He went by Constantinople to
                    Trebizond, thence through <pb break="no"

                    Salsette. He then went to Malabar, »Sumatra, and Java, and by the ports of China
                    to Cambaluc or Peking, where he remained for three years. Turning westward he
                    journeyed by Shensi into Tibet, and was the first European to visit Lassa. His
                    homeward journey led him by Cabul and Khorasan to Tabriz, and thence to Venice.
                    His companion was an Irishman named Friar James.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Ibn Batuta, the great Arab traveller, is separated by a wide space of time from
                    his countrymen already mentioned, and he finds his proper place in a
                    chronological notice after the days of Marco Polo—for he was not born at Tangier
                    until 1304. He began his wanderings in 1325, his career thus coinciding in time
                    with that of Sir John Mandeville (1322-1356), but the Moor was more trustworthy
                    than the Englishman. Ibn Batuta went by land from Tangier to Cairo, then
                    visiting Syria, and performing the pilgrimages to Medina and Mecca. After
                    exploring Persia, and again residing for some time at Mecca, he made a voyage
                    down the Red Sea to Yemen, and travelled through that country to Aden, which
                    remarkable place he correctly describes. Thence he visited the African coast,
                    touching at Momboas and Quiloa, and then sailed across to Ormuz and the Persian
                    Gulf. He crossed Arabia from Bahreyn to Jiddah, traversed the Red Sea and the
                    desert to Syene, and descended the Nile to Cairo. After this he revisited Syria
                    and Asia Minor, crossed the Black Sea to Caffa, and proceeded to the camp of the
                    khan of Kipchak at the foot of the Caucasus. Ibn Batuta crossed the desert from
                    Astrakhan to Bokhara, and went over the Hindu Kush to Cabul, reaching the Indus
                    somewhere below Larkhana, in 1333. He gives an interesting accouut of Muhammad
                    Tughluk, then ruler of Delhi, in whose service the great traveller remained for
                    about eight years. He was sent on an embassy to China in 1342, travelling by
                    land from Delhi to the seaport; whence the ambassadors sailed down the west
                    coast of India to Calicut, and then visited the Maidive Islands and Ceylon. He
                    made a voyage through the Islands to China, and on his return he proceeded from
                    Malabar to Baghdad and Damascus, where he got his first news from home and heard
                    of his father’s death. Finally he reached Fez, the capital of his native
                    country, in November 1349, after an absence of twenty-four years, and came to
                    the conclusion that there was no place like home. After a journey into Spain, he
                    set out for Central Africa in 1352, and reached Timbuctoo and the Niger,
                    returning to Fez in 1353. He had travelled over a length of at least 75,000
                    English miles. His narrative was committed to writing from his dictation, by
                    order of the sultan of Fez, and the work was completed in December 1355. Ibn
                    Batuta died at the age of seventy-three, in the year 1377. His whole work was
                    carefully edited in the original, with a translation into French under the
                    auspices of the Asiatic Society of Paris, and published in 1858. Colonel Yule
                    has given us an English version of the portion relating to China.</p>
                <p>Ibn Batuta was certainly the greatest of Arab travellers, and soon after his
                    death in the kingdom of Fez, the opposite realm of Spain began to send forth
                    explorers to distant lands. The peaceful reign of Henry III. of Castile is
                    famous for the attempts of that prince to extend the diplomatic relations of
                    Spain to the remotest parts of the earth. Mariana telle us that he sent
                    embassies to the princes of Christendom and to the Moors. In 1403 the Spanish
                    king sent a knight of Madrid, named Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, to the court of the
                    mighty Timur, at Samarkand. He re turned in 1406, and died soon after, but not
                    before he had written a most valuable and interesting narrative of his travels
                    from Constantinople through Persia and Khorasan to the Oxus, and thence by the
                    Iron Gates to Samarkand.</p>
                <p>Several Italians continued to make important journeys in the East during the 15th
                    century. Among them was Nicolo Conti, who passed through Persia, sailed along
                    the coast of Malabar, visited Sumatra, Java, and the south of China, returned by
                    the Red Sea, and got home to Venice in 1444, after an absence of twenty-five
                    years. He related his adventures to Poggio Bracciolini, secretary to Pope
                    Eugenius IV.; and the narrative contains much interesting information. Towards
                    the end of the same century, the Venetians sent several embassies to Uzun
                    Hassan, the ruler of Persia, and to Shah Ismail, his successor; and the
                    narratives of the envoys furnish some new geographical information. The first of
                    these was Caterino Zeno, who induced Uzun Hassan to make war on the Turks in
                    1472; and he was followed by Josafat Barbaro and Ambrogio Contarini. Another
                    Venetian^traveller of this period, whose narrative has been preserved, was
                    Giovan Maria Angiolello. He was in the service of the Turks, and was present in
                    their campaign against the Persians. One of the most remarkable of the Italian
                    travellers was Ludovico di Varthema, whose insatiable desire to see foreign
                    countries induced him to leave his native land in the year 1502. He went to
                    Egypt and Syria, and for the sake of visiting the holy cities became a
                    Mahometan. After many extraordinary adventures he got on board a ship at Aden.
                    Varthema is the first European who gave an account of the interior of Yemen. He
                    afterwards visited and described many places in Persia, India, and the Eastern
                    Archipelago, returning to Europe in a Portuguese ship after an absence of five
                    years.</p>
                <p>In mentioning Varthema we have anticipated events; but in the 15th century the
                    time was approaching when the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope was almost
                    indefinitely to widen the scope of geographical enterprise. The great event was
                    preceded by the discovery of the polarity of the magnetic needle, and the
                    consequent construction of the mariner’s compass. This most important discovery
                    appears to have been made in China, and it is uncertain when the compass was
                    first used by Western nations. Its introduction has been attributed to Flavio
                    Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi, in the kingdom of Naples, about the year 1307.
                    Encouraged by the possession of this sure guide, by which at all times and in
                    all places he could with certainty steer his course, the navigator gradually
                    abandoned the method of sailing along the shore, and boldly committed his bark
                    to the open sea. Navigation was then destined to make rapid progress. The
                    growing spirit of enterprise, combined with the increasing light of science,
                    prepared the states of Europe for entering upon that great career of discovery,
                    of which the details constitute the materials for the history of modern
                    geography. Portugal took the lead in this new and brilliant path, and foremost
                    in the front rank of the worthies of this little hero-nation stands the figure
                    of Prince Henry the Navigator.</p>
                <p>The work of Prince Henry is well defined by his biographer, Mr Major. Until his
                    day the pathways of the human race had been the mountain, the river, and the
                    plain, the strait, the lake, and the inland sea. It was he who first <hi
                    rend="superscript">!</hi> conceived the thought of opening a road through the
                    unexplored ocean,—a road replete with danger but abundant n promise. Born on
                    March 4, 1394, Prince Henry waε a younger son of King Joao of Portugal and of
                    Philippa of Lancaster, the grandchild of Edward III.; so that he was half an
                    Englishman. Prince Henry relinquished the pleasures of the court, and took up
                    his abode on the inhospitable promontory of Sagres, at the extreme south-western
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n191/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0191-0180"/> angle of Europe. To find the sea-path to the
                    “thesauris Arabum et divitis Indiae” was the object to which he devoted his
                    life. He collected the information supplied by ancient geographers, unweariedly
                    devoted himself to the study of navigation and cartography, and invited, with
                    princely liberality of reward, the co-operation of the boldest and most skilful
                    navigators of every country. The prince’s motto waβ “Talent de bien faire,”—the
                    word “talent,” in those days, conveying not the idea of power or faculty, but of
                    desire. Having acquired military renown by the capture of Ceuta in 1415, he set
                    his mind upon the conquest of Guinea, and sent every year two or three vessels
                    to examine the coasts beyond Cape Nun, which was then the limit of exploration.
                    Yet none of his ships for many years had the hardihood to round Cape
                    Bojador.</p>
                <p>The first fruit of Prince Henry’s explorations was the rediscovery of Madeira and
                    Porto Santo, in 1418 and 1420. The truth of the romantic story of the first
                    discovery of Madeira by two Euglish lovers named Robert Machim and Anna d’Arfet,
                    in the time of Edward III., has been demonstrated by Mr Major. Madeira and Porto
                    Santo were granted to Prince Henry by his brother, King Duarte, in 1433. In the
                    same year one of the prince’s ships, commanded by Gil Eannes, at length doubled
                    Cape Bojador. In 1435 Affonso Gonsalves Baldaya, the prince’s cup-bearer, passed
                    50 leagues beyond the cape; and eight years afterwards Nuno Tristam got to a
                    point 25 miles beyond Cape Blanco. But it was not until 1445 that the mouth of
                    the Senegal was reached by Diniz Dias; and in those days the Portuguese gave the
                    name of Guinea to the country commencing at Cape Nun. In 1481 the king of
                    Portugal assumed the title of lord of Guinea. Up to 1446 there had been 51
                    caravels to the Guinea coast, and almost every year some new advance was made.
                    Meanwhile the Canaries and Azores were brought within the realms of Spain and
                    Portugal. In 1402 a Norman named Jean de Bethencourt, accompanied by Gadifer de
                    la Salle, had landed on the island of Lançarote, and with reinforcements from
                    Spain he subjugated Forteventura and Ferro, and received the sovereignty of the
                    Canaries from the king of Castile. But he returned to his lands in Normandy in
                    1406, and died there in 1425. Gomera, Palma, Teneriffe, and the Great Canary
                    were still unconquered. Prince Henry made several attempts to establish
                    Portuguese rule on these islands; the right was long disputed with Spain; and it
                    was not until 1479 that the treaty of Alcaçora provided for the concession of
                    the sovereignty of the Canaries to Spain. Prince Henry, however, successfully
                    colonized the Azores, and in 1444 St Michael’s was discovered, the settlement of
                    the other islands following soon afterwards.</p>
                <p>In 1455 an important expedition was despatched by Prince Henry, under the command
                    of a young Venetian adventurer named Alvise Cadamosto. Touching at Madeira and
                    the Canaries, Cadamosto made his way to Cape Blanco on the African coast, and
                    thence to Senegal and the Gambia. He returned with a full report of all he had
                    seen, and in the following year he again sailed from Lagos direct for Cape
                    Blanco, with three ships, and discovered the mouth of a river which he named the
                    Rio Grande (Jeba <hi rend="italic">i).</hi> In 1457 Diogo Gomez sailed with
                    orders to proceed as far as he could, and made his way to the Gambia. The Cape
                    Verd Islands were discovered and colonized about 1462.</p>
                <p>Prince Henry the Navigator died on the 13th of November 1460, and was buried near
                    his father and mother in the monastery of Batalha. In 1839 a monument to his
                    memory was erected at Sagres. During the long period in which the prince was
                    continuing his maritime explorations, he did not cease to cultivate the science
                    of cartography. The geographer Jayme of Majorca superintended his school of
                    navigation at Sagres, and at the prince’s instance the finest specimen of
                    mediaeval map-making that has been preserved was prepared at Venice under the
                    superintendence of Fra Mauro of the Camaldolese convent of San Miguel de Marano.
                    The geographical knowledge of the 15th century is also shown by the famous
                    Borgia map (see Plate II.), a bronze planisphere which came into the possession
                    of Cardinal Borgia about 1794, and was published in 1797 by the cardinal’s
                    nephew. The Borgia map, however, is of the very beginning of the 15th
                    century.</p>
                <p>The progress of discovery for a time received a check from the death of Prince
                    Henry, but only for a time. In 1462 Pedro de Cintra extended Portuguese
                    exploration 600 miles beyond the furthest point reached by Cadamosto, and
                    discovered Sierra Leone. Fernan Gomez followed in 1469, and opened the trade
                    with the Gold Coast; and in 1484 Diogo Cam discovered the mouth of the Congo.
                    The king of Portugal next despatched two vessels of 50 tons in August 1486,
                    under the command of Bartholomeu Dias, to continue discoveries southwards;
                    while, in the following year, he sent Pedro de Covilham and Affonso de Payva to
                    discover the country of Prester John. Dias succeeded in rounding the southern
                    point of Africa, which he named Cabo Tormentoso; but king Joâo II., foreseeing
                    the realization of the long-sought passage to India, gave it the enduring name
                    of the Cape of Good Hope. Dias returned to Lisbon in December 1487; meanwhile
                    Payva had died at Cairo; but Covilham, having heard that a Christian ruler
                    reigned in the mountains of Ethiopia, penetrated into Abyssinia in 1490. He
                    delivered the letter which Joäo II. had addressed to Prester John to the negûs
                    Alexander of Abyssinia, but he was detained by that prince and never allowed to
                    leave the country.</p>
                <p>The results westward and eastward of the exertions of Prince Henry were the
                    discovery of America by Columbus and of the Cape route to India by Vasco da
                    Gama.</p>
                <p>Christopher Columbas was born at Genoa about 1435. His name in Italian was
                    Colombo, and in Spain he is known as Cristoval Colon. The fame of the Portuguese
                    discoveries attracted strangers from all parts of the world, and in 1470
                    Columbus arrived at Lisbon. He was in Portugal from 1470 to 1484, during which
                    time he made several voyages to the coast of Guinea γι the Portuguese service.
                    He married a daughter of Bartholomeu Perestrello, to whom Prince Henry had
                    granted the commandership of Porto Santo, and lived for some time on that
                    island. He learned, from many pilots experienced in the western voyages to the
                    Azores, facts and signs which convinced him that there was an unknown land
                    towards the west. Columbus also studied the <hi rend="italic">Imago Mundi</hi>
                    of Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly, whence he culled all he knew of Aristotle and
                    Strabo; and he read the narrative of Marco Polo. By 1474 his grand project of
                    discovery was established in his mind, and nothing afterwards could divert him
                    from the pursuit of it. On the refusal of the king of Portugal to entertain his
                    proposal, Columbus left Lisbon with his son in 1484, and he spent the interval
                    until 1492 in appeals to the Spanish court. At length, having overcome all
                    obstacles, he set sail with a fleet of three ships from Palos, on the 3d of
                    August 1492, on his unprecedented and perilous voyage. On the 12th of October,
                    having crossed the Atlantic, Columbus sighted land, which was named San
                    Salvador. Mr Major has recently proved that this island is one of the Bahamas,
                    now known as Watling Island. After discovering Cuba, Hispaniola, and many small
                    islands, Columbus set sail on his return voyage on January 16, 1493, and arrived
                    at Palos on the 15th of March. His reception in Spain was enthusiastic, and
                    commensurate with the grandeur of his achievement; and on the 25th of September
                    1493 he sailed from Cadiz on his second voyage, with a fleet of three large
                    ships and fourteen caravels. On the 3d of November he discovered the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n194/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0194-0181"/> island of Dominica, and during the voyage his
                    discoveries included the Windward Islands and Jamaica. He returned to Cadiz on
                    June 11, 1496; and it was not until May 30, 1498, that he set sail on his third
                    voyage. The first land he came to formed a new discovery, which he named the
                    island of Trinidad, and it was in this voyage that he reached the mainland of
                    South America, and discovered the islands of Cubagua and Margarita. A colony had
                    been formed on Hispaniola, and soon afterwards a judge named Francisco de
                    Bobadilla arrived from Spain, having been sent, at the instigation of the great
                    discoverer’s enemies, to inquire into his conduct. Bobadilla seized upon the
                    government, and sent Columbus home in chains. Ferdinand and Isabella were
                    overwhelmed with shame, and the people with astonishment, on his arrival. He was
                    at once released, and false promises of restitution and reward were profusely
                    made. But Bobadilla was superseded, not by Columbus, but by Nicolas de Ovando.
                    On the 9th of May 1502, however, Columbus was allowed to sail on a fourth and
                    last voyage of discovery. He reached the island of Martinique on the 13th of
                    June, and touched at Dominica and Hispaniola. Thence he sailed westward,
                    discovering the coast of Veragua and the harbour of Porto Bello. After a stay in
                    Jamaica, he set sail for Spain on the 12th of September 1504, and arrived at San
                    Lucar on the 7th of November. He lived for two years longer, experiencing the
                    blackest ingratitude from the Spanish court At length, in debt and poverty, and
                    bowed down by disappointment, this great man died May 20, 1506. His body was
                    buried at Valladolid, and removed in 1513 to Cartuja de las Cuevas near Seville.
                    A monument was erected over his grave, with the inscription— A Castilla y
                    Leon,</p>
                <p>Nuevo Mundo diô Colon.</p>
                <p>In 1536 the bodies of Columbus and his son Diego were transported to St Domingo;
                    and thence they were removed to Havana in 1795. The ashes of the immortal
                    discoverer now repose in the cathedral of Havana.</p>
                <p>While Columbus was discovering a new world, the Portuguese continued their
                    persevering efforts to reach India by sea. Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon on
                    the 8th of July 1497 with four vessels built expressly for the voyage, the
                    largest not exceeding 120 tons, and called the “Sam Gabriel.” His brother Paolo
                    commanded the “Sam Raphael,” and the “Berrio” was under Nicolas Coelho. On
                    November 22, with a fair wind, Da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and
                    anchored in the bay named San Bras by Bartholom eu Dias, on the 25th. On
                    Christmas Day he sighted land, which, on that account, he named Natal. He
                    reached Mombas on the 7th of April, and on the 20th of May 1498 he anchored
                    before Calicut. Da Gama returned to Lisbon in August 1499; and at his
                    recommendation another fleet was fitted out, consisting of thirteen well-armed
                    ships, under Pedro Alvarez Cabral, with Bartholomeu Dias and Nicolas Coelho
                    under his orders. The expedition sailed on the 9th of March 1500; and on the 22d
                    of April Cabral discovered the coast of Brazil, and took formal possession for
                    the king of Portugal. Resuming his voyage to the East, he reached Calicut in
                    September, and obtained permission to build a factory, establishing friendly
                    relations also at Cananor and Cochin. He returned to Lisbon in July 1501. Vasco
                    da Gama set sail, with a much larger fleet, on his second voyage in 1502. He
                    visited several ports on the west coast of India, engaged in war as well as in
                    commerce, and returned in September 1503. In 1503 Antonio da Saldanha and
                    Affonso de Albuquerque sailed for India, and made terms of friendship with the
                    chief of Quilon. Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first viceroy of the Indies, was
                    sent out in 1505. He founded the ports of the Angediva and Cananor, and his son
                    Laurenço discovered Ceylon. Tristam da Cunha, with Affonso de Albuquerque under
                    his orders, was sent to occupy Socotra, and in 1506 Albuquerque came to India as
                    second viceroy. He explored the coasts of Arabia and Persia, made the king of
                    Ormus tributary to Portugal, and sent embassies to Abyssinia. In 1509 (?) a
                    factory was established at Malacca; and on November 25, 1510, the great
                    Albuquerque conquered Goa, and established the seat of hi3 government there. In
                    1512 the Moluccas were discovered; and in 1517 Fernam Peres de Audrade reached
                    China, and entered into commercial relations with the governor of Cauton. In
                    1524 Vasco da Gama arrived in India for a third time, as viceroy, and landed at
                    Goa on the 11th of September. He died at Cochin on the 24th of December 1524,
                    and in 1538 his body was transported to Portugal, and buried in his tomb at
                    Vidigueira, of which town he was count.</p>
                <p>The voyages of Vasco da Gama revolutionized the commerce of the East. Until then
                    the Venetians held the carrying trade of India, which was brought by the Persian
                    Gulf and Red Sea into Syria andΕgypt, the Venetians receiving the rich products
                    of the East at Alexandria and Beyrout, and distributing them over Europe. This
                    commerce was a great source of wealth to Venice; but after the discovery of the
                    new passage round the Cape, and the conquests of the Portuguese, the trade of
                    the East passed into other hands.</p>
                <p>The achievements of Columbus and Da Gama are immeasurably enhanced when we
                    consider the inadequate means at their disposal, their small and ill-formed
                    ships, and their defective knowledge of navigation. The mariner’s compass had
                    been in use for nearly two centuries, and it was Columbus himself who first
                    observed the phenomena of variation. But the compass and rough sea-card were the
                    only appliances, until the learned Nuremberger, Martin Behaim, invented the
                    application of the astrolabe to purposes of navigation, which enabled mariners
                    to ascertain their latitude. This was in the year 1480. The astrolabe was used
                    by Vasco da Gama on his first voyage round the Cape of Good Hope; but the
                    movement of a ship rendered accuracy impossible, and the liability to error was
                    increased by the necessity for three observers. One held the astrolabe by a ring
                    passed over the thumb, the second measured the altitude, and the third read off.
                    The astrolabe was a metal circle graduated round the edge, with a limb called
                    the <hi rend="italic">alhidada</hi> fixed to a pin in the centre, and working
                    round the graduated circle. The instrument had two sights fitted upon it, one at
                    each end, and was suspended by a ring so as to hang vertically on oue hand,
                    while the <hi rend="italic">alhidada</hi> was worked up and down until the sun
                    could be seen through both the sights. It then gave the zenith distance. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ordenanzas</hi> of the Spanish council of the Indies record the
                    course of instruction prescribed for pilots, which included the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Sphoera</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi</hi> of Sacrobosco, the
                    spherical triangles of Regiomontanus, the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> of
                    Ptolemy, the use of the astrolabe and its mechanism, the adjustments of
                    instruments, cartography, and the methods of observing the movements of heavenly
                    bodies. The only observations employed by the ancients for finding the longitude
                    were those of the eclipses of the moon, and it was not until 1610 that Galileo
                    discovered another method by observation of Jupiter’s satellites.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of Columbus awakened a spirit of enterprise in Spain which
                    continued in full force for a century; adventurers flocked eagerly across the
                    Atlantic, and discovery followed discovery in rapid succession. Many of the
                    companions of Columbus continued his work. Pinzon in 1499 reached the mouth of
                    the Amazon; and in the same year Alonzo de Ojeda, accompanied by a Florentine
                    named Amerigo Vespucci, touched the coast of South America somewhere near
                    Surinam, following the shore as far as the Gulf of Maracaibo. Vespucci
                    afterwards made three voyages <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0195-0182"/> to the Brazilian coast; and in 1504 he wrote an
                    account of his four voyages, which was widely circulated, and became the means
                    of procuring for its author the high honour of giving his name to the whole
                    continent. Mr Major has discussed the hitherto obscure question of the way in
                    which the name “America” originated, in a paper distinguished for great learning
                    and very able criticism. He has shown that the word “America” first appeared on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mappe</hi><hi rend="italic">Monde</hi> drawn by Leonardo
                    da Vinci, and he explains the chain of circumstances which led to its adoption.
                    The first map known to exist with America delineated upon it is that drawn by
                    Juan de la Cosa, the pilot of Columbus in his second voyage, which is dated
                    1500. Juan de la Cosa was with Ojeda and Vespucci, and afterwards with Ojeda in
                    his last ill-fated expedition. In May 1507, just a year after the death of
                    Columbus, one Martin Waldseemüller (Hyla-comulus) wrote a work called <hi
                    rend="italic">Cosmographiae Introductio,</hi> to which was appended a Latin
                    edition of the four voyages of Vespucci. In this book, which was printed at St
                    Dié in Lorraine, he proposed that the name of America should be given to the New
                    World. In 1508 the first engraved map containing theNewWorld appeared,in an
                    edition of Ptolemy printed at Rome, but it does not bear the name of America.
                    But in 1509 the name “America,” proposed by Hylacomu-lus in 1507, appears, as if
                    it was already accepted as a well-known denomination, in an anonymous work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Globus Mundi,</hi> published at Strasburg. This was
                    three years before the death of Vespucci. The <hi rend="italic">Mapρe Monde</hi>
                    of Leonardo da Vinci, to which Major assigns the date of 1514, has the name of
                    America across the South American continent.</p>
                <p>In 1508 Ojeda obtained the government of the coast of South America from Cabo de
                    la Vela to the Gulf of Darien; and at the same time Diego Nicuesa was appointed
                    governor of Veragua from the Gulf of Darien to Cape Gracias a Dios. The two
                    adventurers arrived at Hispaniola together; but Ojeda set out first for his
                    government, landed at Carthagena in 1510, and sustained a bloody defeat from the
                    natives, in which his lieutenant, Juan de la Cosa, was killed. Ojeda then
                    embarked, and eventually selected a site on the east side of the Gulf of Darien
                    for his seat of government. Here he was again defeated by the natives, and,
                    returning to Hispaniola for aid, he died there in extreme poverty. Nicuesa was
                    still more unfortunate, and died at sea. The Spaniards in the Gulf of Darien
                    were left by Ojeda under the command of Francisco Pizarro, the future conqueror
                    of Peru. After suffering from famine and disease, Pizarro embarked the survivors
                    in small vessels, but outside the harbour they met a ship which proved to be
                    that of the bachiller Martin Fernandez Enciso, Ojeda’s partner, coming with
                    provisions and reinforcements. They all returned to their settlement called San
                    Sebastian, but found that the Indians had destroyed the fort, and Enciso
                    determined to abandon it. One of the crew of Enciso’s ship, Vasco Nunez de
                    Balboa, the future discoverer of the Pacific Ocean, induced his commander to
                    form a settlement on the other side of the Gulf of Darien. The soldiers became
                    discontented and deposed Enciso, when Vasco Nunez, a clever and courageous
                    adventurer, took command of the Darien settlement in March 1511. Enciso was a
                    man of learning, and an accomplished cosmographer. His work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Suma de Geografia,</hi> which was printed in 1519, is the first Spanish book
                    which gives an account of America. Vasco Nunez, the new commander, entered upon
                    a career of conquest in the neighbourhood of Darien, which ended in the
                    discovery of the Pacific Ocean on the 25th of September 1513. In 1514 Pedrarias
                    de Avila, an old man of rank and some reputation, but with no ability, and of a
                    malicious disposition, was appointed to supersede Vasco Nunez as governor of
                    Darien, and the bachiller Enciso came out in his fleet. Pedrarias, on a false
                    pretext, beheaded Vasco Nunez in 1517, which was one of the greatest calamities
                    that could have happened to South America at that time; for the discoverer of
                    the South Sea was on the point of sailing with a little fleet into his unknown
                    ocean, and a humane and judicious man would have been the conqueror of Peru,
                    instead of the cruel and ignorant Pizarro. In the year 1519 Panama was founded
                    by Pedrarias; and the conquest of Peru by Pizarro followed a few years
                    afterwards. Hernan Cortes overran and conquered Mexico from 1518 to 1521, and
                    the discovery and conquest of Guatemala by Alvarado, of Florida by Hernando de
                    Soto, and of Nueva Granada by Quesada, followed in rapid succession. The first
                    detailed account of the west coast of South America was written by that keenly
                    observant old soldier, Pedro de Cieza de Leon, who was travelling in South
                    America from 1533 to 1550, and published his story at Seville in 1553.</p>
                <p>But the great anxiety of the Spanish Government at that time was to find a
                    westward route to the Moluccas. For this purpose Juan Diaz de Solis was
                    despatched in October 1515, and in January 1516 he discovered the mouth of the
                    Rio de la Plata. He was, however, killed by the natives, and his ships returned.
                    In the following year Magellan laid before Charles V., at Valladolid, a scheme
                    for reaching the Spice Islands by sailing westward. He had already served with
                    his own countrymen, the Portuguese, on the coast of India and at the taking of
                    Malacca, and he was an accomplished and resolute seaman. With a fleet of five
                    ships, and the rank of captain-general, Magellan sailed from San Lucar on the
                    21st of September 1519. After touching on the coast of Brazil, at the Rio de la
                    Plata, and at the ports on the east coast of Patagonia, Magellan entered the
                    straits which bear his name in October 1520. In consequence of many fires being
                    seen on the southern shores of the strait, he named that country Tierra del
                    Fuego. The fleet, now consisting of the “Trinidad,” “Vittoria,” and
                    “Concepcion,” emerged from the strait and entered the Pacific Ocean on the 27th
                    of November 1520. They then steered north-west, crossed the line on the 13th of
                    February 1521, and on the 6th of March reached the Ladrone Islands. Thence
                    Magellan proceeded to the Philippines. He was killed in an attack on the island
                    of Matan, which he made in order to bring it under subjection to his ally the
                    king of Zebu, on the 26th of April 1521. Thus fell this great navigator, who was
                    second only to Columbus in the history of nautical exploration. His
                    brother-in-law, Duarte Barbosa, was selected to succeed Magellan in command of
                    the fleet, with Joâo Serrao as his colleague. They were both killed in battles
                    with the natives, and eventually a Biscayan named Sebastian del Cano, sailing
                    home by way of the^Cape of Good Hope, reached San Lucar in command of the
                    “Vittoria” on the 6th of September 1522, with eighteen survivors. Del Cano was
                    received with great distinction by the emperor, who granted him a globe for his
                    crest, and the motto “Primus circumdedisti me.”</p>
                <p>While the Spaniards were circumnavigating the world and completing their
                    knowledge of the coasts of Central and South America, the Portuguese were
                    actively engaged on similar work as regards Africa and the East Indies.</p>
                <p>In Abyssinia the mission of Covilham led to further intercourse. In April 1520
                    the Portuguese viceroy of the Indies took a fleet into the Red Sea, and landed
                    an embassy consisting of Dorn Rodriguez de Lima and Father Francisco Alvarez, a
                    priest whose detailed narrative is the earliest and not the least interesting
                    account we possess of Abyssinia. It was not until 1526 that the embassy was
                    dismissed; and not many years afterwards the negûs entreated the help of the
                    Portuguese against Mahometan invaders, and the viceroy sent an expeditionary
                    force, commanded by his brother Cristoforo da Gama, with 450 musketeers. Da Gama
                    was taken prisoner and killed, but his Portuguese <pb break="no"

                    their power, and a Jesuit mission remained in the country. While Abyssinia was
                    thus opened to the enterprise of the Portuguese on the east side of Africa, they
                    also established a close connexion with the kingdom of Congo on the west side,
                    and obtained much information respecting the interior of the continent. Duarte
                    Lopes, a Portuguese settled in the country, was sent on a mission to Rome by the
                    king of Congo, and Pope Sixtus V. caused him to recount to his chamberlain,
                    Felipe Pigafetta, all he had learned during the nine years he had been in
                    Africa, from 1578 to 1587. This narrative, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description of the Kingdom of Congo,</hi> was published at Rome by Pigafetta in
                    1591. A map was attached on which the two equatorial lakes, Victoria and Albert
                    Nyanza, and Lake Tanganyika are shown, and the empire of Monomoezi or Uniamuezi
                    is laid down. The most valuable work on Africa during the 16th century is,
                    however, that written by Leo Africanus. This famous traveller was born at
                    Granada, and retired into Africa when his native town was captured by the
                    Spaniards. He travelled extensively in the north and west of Africa, and was
                    eventually taken by pirates and sold to a master who presented him to Pope Leo
                    X. At the pope’s desire he translated his work on Africa into Italian, and died
                    in about the year 1526.</p>
                <p>In the East Indies the Portuguese acquired predominating influence at sea,
                    establishing factories on the Malabar coast, in the Persian Gulf, at Malacca,
                    and in the Spice Islands, and extending their commercial enterprises from the
                    Red Sea to China. Their missionaries were received at the court of Akbar, and
                    Benedict Goes, a native of the Azores, was despatched on a journey overland from
                    Agra to China. He started in 1603, and, after traversing the least known parts
                    of Central Asia, he reached the confines of China. He appears to have ascended
                    from Cabul to the plateau of the Pamir, and thence onwards by Yarkand, Khotan,
                    and Aksu. He died at a place called Socieu in March 1607; and thus, as one of
                    the brethren pronounced his epitaph, “seeking Cathay he found heaven.”</p>
                <p>The activity and love of adventure, which became a passion for two or three
                    generations in Spain and Portugal, spread to other countries. It was the spirit
                    of the age; and England, Holland, and France soon began to enter upon the same
                    glorious career. English enterprise was first aroused by John and Sebastian
                    Cabot, father and son, who came from Venice and settled at Bristol in the time
                    of Henry VII. The Cabots received a patent, dated March 5, 1496, empowering them
                    to seek unknown lands; and John Cabot discovered Newfoundland and part of the
                    coast of America. Sebastian afterwards made a voyage to Rio de la Plata in the
                    service of Spain, but he returned to England in 1548, and received a pension
                    from Edward VI. “in consideration of the good and acceptable services done and
                    to be done.” He was placed at the head of the Society of Merchant Adventurers,
                    and, by his knowledge and experience, he was the means of keeping alive the
                    spirit of enterprise in England, and of extending her foreign commerce. At his
                    suggestion a voyage was undertaken for the discovery of a north-east passage to
                    Cathay, with Sir Hugh Willoughby as captain-general of the fleet, and Richard
                    Chancellor as piloLmajor. They sailed in May 1553, but Willoughby and all his
                    crew perished in a harbour on the Lapland coast. Chancellor, however, was more
                    fortunate. He reached the White Sea, performed the journey overland to Moscow,
                    where he was well received, and may be said to have been the founder of the
                    trade between Russia and England. He returned to Archangel and brought his ship
                    back in safety to England. On a second voyage, in 1556, Chancellor was drowned;
                    and three subsequent voyages, led by Stephen Burrough, Pet, and Jackman,
                    effected an examination of the straits which lead into the Sea of Kara.</p>
                <p>The French followed closely on the track of John Cabot, and the hardy Norman and
                    Breton seamen frequented the banks of Newfoundland at the commencement of the
                    16th century. In 1524 Francis I. sent Giovanni da Verazzano of Florence on an
                    expedition of discovery to the coast of North America; and the details of his
                    voyage were embodied in a letter addressed by him to the king of France from
                    Dieppe, in July 1524. On April 20, 1534, Jacques Cartier sailed from St Malo
                    with two vessels of 60 tons each, for the purpose of continuing the discoveries
                    of Verazzano, and he visited Newfoundland and the Gulf of St Lawrence. In the
                    following year he made another voyage, discovered the island of Anticosti, and
                    ascended the St Lawrence to a place called Hochelaga, now Montreal. He returned,
                    after passing two winters in Canada; and on another occasion he also failed to
                    establish a colony. Admiral de Coligny made several unsuccessful endeavours to
                    form a colony in Florida under Jean Ribault of Dieppe, René de Laudonnière, and
                    others, but the settlers were furiously assailed by the Spaniards -and the
                    attempt was abandoned.</p>
                <p>The reign of Elizabeth is famous for the gallant enterprises that were undertaken
                    by sea and land to discover and bring to light the unknown parts of the earth.
                    The great promoter and father of English geographical discovery was Richard
                    Hakluyt, who was born near London in 1553. He was at Westminster School, and
                    when quite a boy he imbibed a love for cosmography and maritime discovery. At
                    Oxford he read all the narratives of voyages and travels that came within his
                    reach, and delivered lectures on cartography. In 1585 he was at Paris, as
                    chaplain to the English embassy, and in 1605 he became a prebendary of
                    Westminster. He was the chief promoter in the formation of the two companies for
                    colonizing Virginia in 1606; and he devoted his life to the encouragement of
                    similar undertakings, and to their record. Hakluyt died in 1616, and was buried
                    in Westminster Abbey. He was incessantly employed in the collection,
                    examination, and translation of accounts of voyages and travels, and of
                    charters, letters, and other documents bearing on the subject, and in
                    correspondence with men eager either to impart or receive information. Sir
                    Philip Sidney, Sir Francis Walsingham, Lord Thomas Howard, and Sir Francis Drake
                    were among those who supported and encouraged him, and Ortelius and Mercator
                    were his correspondents. His first work was the <hi rend="italic">Divers Voyages
                    touching the Discover™ of America</hi>; and the second was brought out while he
                    was in Paris in 1586, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Notable</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Historie</hi><hi rend="italic">containing Foure Voyages made by French
                    Captayηes unto Florida.</hi> In 1587 he published at Paris a revised edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">De Orbe</hi><hi rend="italic">Novo</hi> of Peter Martyr
                    Anghiera. His <hi rend="italic">Principal Navigations</hi> was published in
                    folio in 1589, and dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham; and the new edition, in
                    three volumes, appeared in 1598. Hakluyt also got translations made of Leo
                    Africanus, of Mendoza’s <hi rend="italic">History of China,</hi> and of
                    Galvano’s <hi rend="italic">Discoveries of the World,</hi> which were*published.
                    His last publication was a translation of Hernando de Soto’s discoveries in
                    Florida. He left many valuable papers at his death, most of which, together with
                    a vast number of other narratives, were published in 1622 in the great work of
                    the Rev. Samuel Purchas, entitled “Hakluytus Posthumus, or Purchas his
                    Pilgrimes.”</p>
                <p>It is from the rich treasure-house of Hakluyt and Purchas that our knowledge of
                    the gallant deeds of the English and other explorers of the Elizabethan age is
                    mainly derived. The great collections of voyages and travels of De Bry and
                    Hulsius served a similar useful purpose on the continent of Europe. One
                    important object of English maritime adventurers<pb break="no"

                    by the north-west, a second was to settle Virginia, and a third was to beat up
                    the Spanish settlements in the Indies. Nor was the trade to Muscovy and Turkey
                    neglected; while latterly a resolute and successful attempt was made to
                    establish commercial relations with East India.</p>
                <p>Martin Frobisher led the way in the direction of the north-west, sailing from the
                    Thames in 1576, and sighting the southern part of Greenland on the 11th of July.
                    In this voyage he discovered a part of the coast of Labrador, and the strait
                    (now known to be a deep bay) which bears his name. He brought home some stones
                    which were believed to be gold, and the consequence was that there arose an
                    eager desire to obtain more. Many speculators subscribed, and Frobisher was sent
                    out on a second voyage, “more for the searching of this gold ore than for the
                    searching any further discovery of the passage.” He left Gravesend on May 27,
                    1577, wasted his time in picking up stones on the shores of Frobisher’s Strait,
                    and returned on the 22d of August. The excitement about the gold ore still
                    continued. The queen gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Meta Incognita</hi> to
                    the newly discovered country; and on May 21,1578, Frobisher set out on a third
                    voyage with a fleet of fifteen ships. After touching at Greenland, they made for
                    the opposite shore through an ice-encumbered sea, and the fleet was separated
                    during a heavy gale. They reached various ports in England during October, and
                    by that time the bubble about the gold ore had burst, and the enterprise was
                    considered a failure. The first of the three voyages alone was a voyage of
                    discovery.</p>
                <p>In 1585 John Davis, an admirable seaman and most resolute explorer, was employed
                    by some merchants, chief among whom was Mr William Sanderson of London, to take
                    up the glorious work where Frobisher had left off. He sailed from Dartmouth on
                    the 7th of June 1585, and, reaching the south-west coast of Greenland, he called
                    it the “Land of Desolation.” He then stood over to the opposite coast, which he
                    examined in the neighbourhood of Cape Walsingham, returning to Dartmouth on
                    September 30. In 1588 he sailed on the 7th of June and coasted along Greenland,
                    having friendly intercourse with the Eskimo. He also examined part of the
                    Labrador coast. In his third voyage he sailed from Dartmouth on the 17th of May,
                    and sighted Greenland on the 14th of June. On this occasion he went as far north
                    as 72° 12', naming the great island bluff—which is now so well known to voyagers
                    up Baffin’s Bay—“Sanderson his Hope of a North-West Passage.” Crossing over
                    Davis Strait, the bold explorer discovered the strait which now bears the name
                    of Hudson. Davis was followed in his northern voyages by Waymouth, Hall, and
                    Knight; and in 1607 Henry Hudson was despatched on a voyage of discovery in a
                    small vessel of 80 tons. He sighted the east coast of Greenland in 73° N.,
                    examined the north west end of Spitzbergen, as far as a point which he named
                    Hakluyt Headland, and reached 80° 23' N. In 1608 he made a second voyage, during
                    which he examined the edge of the ice between Spitzbergen and Greenland. In his
                    third voyage, in 1609, he was employed by the Dutch, and discovered the Hudson
                    River. In 1610 he was again employed by English merchants, and entered Hudson’s
                    Bay, but was infamously abandoned in an open boat by his crew. In 1612 Sir
                    Thomas Button continued the exploration of Hudson’s Bay, which was completed by
                    Thomas James and Luke Fox in 1631.</p>
                <p>In 1616 the little bark “Discovery,” of 35 tons, was fitted out by those
                    persevering adventurers Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Dudley Digges, John Wolstenholme,
                    and Aiderman Jones, for another attempt in the icy seas. This was the most
                    successful Arctic voyage of the 17th century. Robert Bylot was appointed master
                    of the “Discovery,” and William Baffin was pilot. They sailed from Gravesend,
                    with 17 souls on board, on the 26th of March, and were off Hope Sanderson, the
                    extreme point of Davis, on the 30th of May. The “Discovery” reached what is now
                    called “the north water” of Baffin’s Bay on the 1st of July, and, after
                    discovering the head of the great bay which bears his name, the pilot Baffin
                    returned by sailing down the west side of it. On August 30 the “Discovery” was
                    again safely anchored in Dover roads. It was exactly 200 years before any other
                    vessel followed in her track, and reached “the north water.” Both Davis and
                    Baffin afterwards served and were killed in the East Indies.</p>
                <p>The Dutch emulated the English in the Arctic seas during this period. Their
                    merchants opened a trade with Kola and Archangel as early as 1578, but the
                    difficulty of penetrating into the Sea of Kara led them to try the possibility
                    of finding a passage round the northern end of Novaya Zemlya. The credit of the
                    conception of this voyage is due to the great cosmographer Peter Plancius, and
                    the merchants of Amsterdam adopted the idea, and despatched a vessel of 100 tons
                    called the “Mercurius,” under the command of William Barents. He sailed from the
                    Texel on June 4, 1594, and sighted Novaya Zemlya on the 4th of July. Sailing
                    northwards along the coast he rounded Cape Nassau and reached the edge of the
                    ice. For many days he perseveringly sought for a passage through it. In his
                    second voyage he merely went to the entrance of the Sea of Kara. But his third
                    voyage was the most important Heemskerk was the commander, Barents was pilot,
                    and the mate, Gerrit de Veer, was the historian of the voyage. They sailed from
                    Amsterdam on May 13, 1596. On June 19, Spitzbergen was discovered, and the whole
                    western coast and part of the northern examined. The record of the subsequent
                    proceedings of Barents and his crew, of their famous voyage round the
                    north-western end of Novaya Zemlya, and of their terrible sufferings in the
                    first Arctic winter ever faced by Europeans, is deeply interesting as it is told
                    in the simple narrative of Gerrit de Veer. Barents had long been ill, and when
                    they set sail from their dismal winter harbour on June 14, 1597, in open boats,
                    he was too weak to stand, and was carried from the house. He died on the 19th,
                    aud found a grave in the midst of his discoveries.</p>
                <p>The maritime enterprise of England, in the days of Elizabeth, was mainly directed
                    towards the discovery of a north-west passage; but many voyages were also made
                    to Guinea and the West Indies, and twice English vessels followed in the track
                    of Magellan, and circumnavigated the globe.</p>
                <p>In 1577 Francis Drake, who had previously served with Hawkins in the West Indies,
                    undertook his celebrated voyage round the world. His fleet consisted of three
                    ships and two pinnaces, which were broken up during the voyage. The ships were
                    the “Pelican” of 100 tons, on board of which Drake himself embarked, the
                    “Elizabeth” of 80, and the “Marigold” of 30 tons. After some stay at Port San
                    Julian on the coast of Patagonia, the fleet entered the Straits of Magellan on
                    the 20th of August 1578, when Drake changed the name of his ship to the “Golden
                    Hind.” They reached the western entrance on the 6th of September, and soon
                    afterwards the “Marigold” parted company in a gale of wind, and was never heard
                    of again, while the “Elizabeth” basely deserted her consort and returned to
                    England. Drake, in the “Golden Hind,” continued the voyage alone. At first he
                    was driven to the southernmost point of Tierra del Fuego, and thus discovered
                    that there was a passage, though he did not round Cape Horn. He then proceeded
                    northward along the west coast of America, touching at the island of Mocha off
                    the Chilian coast, at Valparaiso, Coquimbo, Tarapaca, Arica, Callao, and Payta.
                    Off Cape <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"

                    a very rich Spanish treasure-ship called the “Cacafuego”; and it is right to
                    observe that England was then at peace with Spain. Drake resolved to attempt the
                    discovery of a passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and with this object he
                    continued to shape a course northwards along the American continent. On the 5th
                    of June 1579 the “Golden Hind” reached her most northern point in 48°, when the
                    attempt was abandoned, and Drake put into a harbour to refit, named Port Drake,
                    which appears to have been the modern harbour of San Francisco, on the coast of
                    California. The coast from the southern extremity of the Californian peninsula
                    to Cape Mendocino was discovered by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and Francisco de
                    Ulloa in 1539. Drake’s discoveries extend rom Cape Mendocino to 48° N.</p>
                <p>Leaving California, Drake sailed across the Pacific and reached the Philippine
                    Islands in October. He touched at Ternate and Java, and rounded the Cape of Good
                    Hope on June 15, 1580. The “Golden Hind” anchored safely at Plymouth on the 26th
                    of the following September. Drake was graciously received and knighted by the
                    queen, and the “Golden Hind,” the first English ship that circumnavigated the
                    globe, was preserved for many years at Deptford. When at last she was broken up,
                    a chair was made from one of her planks and presented to the university of
                    Oxford.</p>
                <p>Mr Thomas Cavendish, a geutleman of Suffolk, emulous of Drake’s example, fitted
                    out three vessels for an expedition to the South Sea, and sailed from Plymouth
                    on July 21, 1586. Cavendish passed through Magellan’s Straits in January 1587,
                    and, taking the same route as Drake along the west coast of America, he reached
                    Mazatlan in September. A rich Spanish treasure-ship was captured off Cape San
                    Lucas, the southern extremity of California, on the 4th of November, and
                    Cavendish then steered across the Pacific, seeing no land until he reached the
                    Ladrone Islands. He arrived safely at Plymouth on the 9th of September 1588. The
                    third English voyage into the Pacific was not so fortunate. Sir Richard Hawkins
                    sailed from Plymouth on the 12th of June 1593 in the good ship “Dainty,” passed
                    through Magellan’s Straits, and all went well until they reached the bay of
                    Atacame3, 57 miles north of the equator, in June 1594. Here the English were
                    attacked by a Spanish fleet, and, after a desperate naval engagement, Hawkins
                    was forced to surrender. Hawkins declared his object to be discovery and the
                    survey of unknown lands, and his voyage, though terminating in disaster, bore
                    good fruit. <hi rend="italic">The Observations of Sir Richard Hawkins in his
                    Voyage into the South Sea,</hi> published in 1622, are very valuable, and form
                    the most charming work of the kind which was written during that period. It was
                    long before another English ship entered the Pacific Ocean. Sir John Narborough
                    took two ships through the Straits of Magellan in 1670 and touched on the coast
                    of Chili; but it was not until 1685 that Cook and Dampier sailed over the part
                    of the Pacific where, nearly a century before, the “Dainty” had to strike her
                    flag to the Spaniard.</p>
                <p>The exploring enterprise of the Spanish nation did not wane after the conquest of
                    Peru and Mexico, and the acquisition of the vast empire of the Indies. It was
                    rather spurred into renewed activity by the audacity of Sir John Hawkins in the
                    West Indies, and by the appearance of Drake, Cavendish, and Richard Hawkins in
                    the Pacific.</p>
                <p>In the interior of South America the Spanish conquerors had explored the region
                    of the Andes from the isthmus of Panama to Chili; and in 1541 Francisco de
                    Orellana discovered the whole course of the Amazon from its source in the
                    Quitenian Andes to the Atlantic. A second voyage down the great river was made
                    in 1561 by the mad pirate Lope de Aguirre; but it was not until 1639 that a full
                    account was written of the mighty stream by Father Cristoval de Acuna, who
                    ascended it from its mouth to the city of Quito. The voyage of Drake across the
                    Pacific was preceded by that of Alvaro de Mendaiia, who was despatched from Peru
                    in 1567 to discover the Australian land which was believed to exist in the South
                    Sea. After a voyage of eighty days across the Pacific,Mendaiia discovered the
                    Salomon Islands; and the expedition returned in safety to Callao. The appearance
                    of Drake on the Peruvian coast led to an expedition being fitted out at Callao,
                    to go in chase of him, under the command of Pedro Sarmiento. He sailed from
                    Callao in‘October 1579, and made a careful survey of the Straits of Magellan,
                    with the object of fortifying that entrance to the South Sea. The colony which
                    he afterwards took out from Spain was a complete failure, andisonlyrememberednow
                    fromthe name of “Port Famine” which Cavendish gave to the site at which he found
                    the starving remnant of Sarmiento’s settlers. In June 1595 Mendaiia sailed from
                    the coast of Peru in command of a second expedition to colonize the Salomon
                    Islands. After discovering the Marquesas, he reached the island of Santa Cruz of
                    evil memory, where he and many of the settlers died. His young widow took
                    command of the survivors and brought them safely to Manila. The viceroys of Peru
                    still persevered in their attempts to plant a colony in Australia. Pedro
                    Fernandez de Quiros, who was pilot under Mendaiia and Luis Vaez de Torres were
                    sent in command of two ships to continue the work of exploration. They sailed
                    from Callao on December 21, 1605, and discovered several islands of the New
                    Hebrides group. They anchored in a bay of a large island which Quiros named
                    “Australia del Espiritu Santo.” From this place Quiros returned to America, but
                    Torres continued the voyage, passed through the strait between Australia and New
                    Guinea which bears his name, and explored and mapped the southern and (as has
                    recently been proved) also the eastern coast of New Guinea.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese, in the early part of the 17th century (1578-1640), were under the
                    dominion of Spain, and their enterprise was to some extent damped; but their
                    missionaries extended geographical knowledge in Africa. Father Francisco Paez
                    acquired great influence in Abyssinia, and explored its highlands from 1600 to
                    1622. Fathers Mendez and Lobo traversed the deserts between the coast of the Red
                    Sea and the mountains, became acquainted with the shores of Lake Tsana, and
                    discovered the sources of the Abai or Blue Nile in 1624-1633.</p>
                <p>But the attention of the Portuguese was mainly devoted to vain attempts to
                    maintain their monopoly of the trade of India against the powerful rivalry of
                    the English and Dutch. The English enterprises were persevering, continuous, and
                    successful. James Lancaster made a voyage to the Indian Ocean from 1591 to 1594;
                    andin 1599 the merchants and adventurers of London resolved to form a company,
                    with the object of establishing a trade with the East Indies. On the 31st of
                    December 1599 Queen Elizabeth granted the charter of incorporation to the East
                    India Company, and Sir James Lancaster, one of the directors, was appointed
                    general of their first fleet. He was accompanied by John Davis, the great Arctic
                    navigator, as pilot-major. This voyage was eminently successful. The ships
                    touched at Achiu in Sumatra and at Java, returning with full ladings of pepper
                    in 1603. The second voyage was commanded by Sir Henry Middleton; but it was in
                    the third voyage, under Keelinge and Hawkins, that the mainland of India was
                    first reached in 1607. Captain Hawkins landed at Surat and travelled overland to
                    Agra, passing some time at the court of the Great Mogul. In the voyage of Sir
                    Edward Michelborne, John Davis of Arctic fame lost his life in a fight with a
                    Japanese junk on December 27, 1605. The <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0199-0186"/> eighth voyage, led by Captain Saris, extended the
                    operations of the company to Japan; and in 1613 the Japanese Government granted
                    privileges to the Company; but the English retired in 1623, giving up their
                    factory. The chief result of this early intercourse between England and Japan
                    was the interesting series of letters written by William Adams from 1611 to
                    1617. Adams, however, though an Englishman, went to Japan in a Dutch ship. From
                    the tenth voyage of the East India Company, commanded by Captain Best, who left
                    England in 1612, dates the establishment of permanent English factories on the
                    coast of India. It was Captain Best who secured a regular firman for trade from
                    the Great Mogul. From that time a fleet was despatched every year, and the
                    Company’s operations greatly increased geographical knowledge of India and the
                    Eastern Archipelago.</p>
                <p>The visits of Englishmen to Eastern countries, at this time, were not confined to
                    the voyages of the Company. Journeys were also made by land, and, among others,
                    Thomas Coryat, of Odcombe in Somersetshire, walked from France to India, and
                    died in the Company’s factory at Surat. In 1561 Mr Anthony Jenkinson arrived in
                    Persia with a letter from Queen Elizabeth to the shah. He travelled through
                    Russia to Bokhara, and returned by the Caspian and Volga. In 1579 Christopher
                    Burroughs built a ship at Nijni Novgorod and traded across the Caspian to Baku;
                    and in 1598 Sir Anthony and Robert Shirley arrived in Persia, and Robert was
                    afterwards sent by the shah to Europe as his ambassador. He was followed by a
                    Spanish mission under Garcia de Silva, who wrote an interesting account of his
                    travels: and to Sir Dormer Cotton’s mission, in 1628, we are indebted for Sir
                    Thomas Herbert’s charming narrative. In like manner, Sir Thomas Roe’s mission to
                    India resulted not only in a large collection of valuable reports and letters of
                    his own, but also in the detailed account of his chaplain Mr Terry. But the most
                    learned and intelligent traveller in the East, during the 17th century, was the
                    German Koempfer, who accompanied an embassy to Persia in 1684, and was
                    afterwards a surgeon in the service of the Dutch East India Company. He was in
                    the Persian Gulf, India, and Java, and resided for more than two years in Japan,
                    from 1690 to 1692. His <hi rend="italic">History of Japan</hi> was published in
                    England in 1727, Koempfer himself having died in 1716. From these various
                    sources a considerable increase was made in the knowledge of India, Per≡ia, and
                    the further East.</p>
                <p>The Dutch nation, as soon as it was emancipated from Spanish tyranny, displayed
                    an amount of enterprise which, for a long time, was fully equal to that of
                    England. The memorable Arctic voyages of Barents were quickly followed by the
                    establishment of a Dutch East India Company; and Holland, ousting the
                    Portuguese, not only established factories on the mainland of India and in
                    Japan, but acquired a preponderating influence throughout the Eastern
                    Archipelago. In 1583 Jan Hugen van Linschoten made a voyage to India with a
                    Portuguese fleet, and his full and graphic descriptions of India, Africa, China,
                    and the Eastern Archipelago must have been of no small U3e to his countrymen in
                    the commencement of their distant voyages. The first of their Indian voyages was
                    performed by ships which sailed from Holland in April 1595, and rounded the Cape
                    of Good Hope. A second large Dutch fleet sailed in 1598; and, so eager was the
                    young republic to extend her commerce over the world that another fleet,
                    consisting of five ships of Rotterdam, was sent in the same year by way of
                    Magellan’s Straits, under Jacob Mahu as admiral, with William Adams as pilot.
                    Mahu died on the passage out, and was succeeded by Simon de Cordes, who was
                    killed on the coast of Chili. In September 1599 the fleet had entered the
                    Pacific. The ships were then steered direct for Japan, and anchored off Bungo in
                    April 1600. In the very same year, 1598, a third expedition was despatched under
                    Oliver van Noort, a native of Utrecht. The fleet left Holland in September 1598,
                    and entered the South Sea, through the Straits of Magellan, in February 1600,
                    after a tedious, and in truth unskilfιd, navigation of nearly a year and a half
                    from the time of leaving Holland. After keeping along the west coast of America
                    nearly as far as the line, Van Noort shaped a course for the Ladrone Islands,
                    and arrived off Manila. In August 1601 he anchored in front of Rotterdam, after
                    an absence of three years, but the voyage contributed nothing to geography. The
                    Dutch Company in 1614 again resolved to send a fleet to the Moluccas by the
                    westward route, and Joris Spilbergen was appointed to the command as admiral,
                    with a commission from the States-General. He was furnished with 4 ships of
                    Amsterdam, 2 of Rotterdam, and 1 from Zeeland. On May 6, 1615, Spilbergen
                    entered the Pacific Ocean, and touched at several places on the coast of Chili
                    and Peru, defeating the Spanish fleet in a naval engagement off Chilca, After
                    plundering Payta and makingrequisitions at Acapulco, the Dutch-fleet crossed the
                    Pacific and reached the Moluccas in March 1616. At that time the Dutch Company
                    had 37 sail of European shipping and 3000 troops in the East Indies.</p>
                <p>The Dutch now resolved to discover a passage into the Pacific to the south of
                    Tierra del Fuego, the existence of which was ascertained by Sir Francis Drake.
                    The vessels fittèd out for this purpose were the “Eerdracht,” of 360 tons,
                    commanded by Jacob le Maire, and the “Horn,” of 110 tons, under Jan Schouten.
                    They sailed from the Texel on June 14, 1615, and by the 20th of January 1616
                    they were south of the entrance of Magellan’s Straits. Passing through the
                    strait of Le Maire they came to the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego,
                    which was named Cape Horn, in honour of the town of Horn in West Friesland, of
                    which Schouten was a native. They passed the cape on the 31st of January,
                    encountering the usual westerly winds. The great merit of this discovery of a
                    second passage into the South Sea lies in the fact that it was not’accidental or
                    unforeseen, but was due to the sagacity of those who designed the voyage. On
                    March 1 the Dutch fleet sighted the island of Juan Fernandez; and, having
                    crossed the Pacific, the explorers sailed along the north coast of New Guinea,
                    and arrived at the Moluccas on September 17, 1616. In 1623 the Dutch sent
                    expeditions against Brazil and Peru, which, however, did little to advance
                    geographical knowledge, except that the Brazilian invasion resulted in the
                    valuable work of Nieuħof.</p>
                <p>There were several early indications of the existence of the great Australian
                    continent, which have been very ably discussed by Mr Major; and the Hollanders
                    endeavoured to obtain further knowledge concerning the country and ita extent;
                    but only its northern and western coasts had been visited before the time of
                    Governor Van Diemen. Dirk Hartog had been on the west coast in latitude 26° 30'
                    S. in 1616. Pelsert struck on a reef called “Houtman’s Abrolhos” on June 4,
                    1629. In 1697 the Dutch captain Vlamingh landed on the west coast of Australia
                    in 31° 43' S., and named the Swan River, where he saw some black swans. In 1642
                    the governor and council of Batavia fitted out two ships to prosecute the
                    discovery of the south land, and entrusted the command to Captain Abel Jansen
                    Tasman. This voyage proved to be the most important to geography that had been
                    undertaken since the first circumnavigation of the globe. Tasman sailed from
                    Batavia in the yacht “Heemskirk” on the 14th of August 1642, and from Mauritius
                    on the 8th of October. On November 24 high land was sighted in 42° 30' S., which
                    was named Van Diemen’s Land, and, after landing there, sail was again <pb

                    Land) was discovered on the 14th of December. Tasman communicated with the
                    natives and anchored in what he called Murderer’s Bay. From New Zealand it was
                    resolved to steer eastward to longitude 220°, and then north. On this course the
                    ships arrived at Tongatabu, one of the Friendly Islands of Cook; in April 1643
                    they were off the north coast of New Guinea; and on June 15 Tasman returned to
                    Batavia. In 1644 Tasman made a second voyage to effect a more full discovery of
                    New Guinea.</p>
                <p>The French directed their enterprise more in the direction of North America than
                    of the Indies. One of their most distinguished naval worthies was Samuel
                    Champlain, a native of Brouage in Saintonge, whose friend and patron was Aymar
                    de Chastes, governor of Dieppe, a devoted follower of Henry IV. Champlain after
                    the close of the war with the League in Brittany, in which he served, made a
                    remarkable journey through Mexico and the West India Islands from 1599 to 1602,
                    and on his return he found that Μ. de Chastes was, undeterred by previous
                    failures, resolved to undertake the establishment of a colony in Canada.
                    Champlain was sent on a voyage of reconnaissance, and on his return he found
                    that the Sieur de Chastes was dead. In 1603 the Sieur de Monts was named
                    vice-admiral of the coasts of Acadia, and Champlain sailed with him from Dieppe.
                    He was for some years engaged in surveying all the coasts of Acadia and Cape
                    Breton, and in 1607 he returned to France with De Monts. In the following year
                    another attempt was made. Champlain, with a colleague named Du Pont Gravé,
                    sailed to the St Lawrence, and on July 3, 1608, they first arrived at Quebec. In
                    1609 Champlain ascended the Iroquois to the lake which still bears his name. By
                    1611 a regular colony was established at Quebec; and in 1620 Champlain was
                    installed as governor. He died towards the end of the year 1635. Champlain was
                    an able navigator and a resolute explorer, and he made a very large addition to
                    the knowledge of Canada and Acadia (Novia Scotia).</p>
                <p>The last expedition of the 17th century was purely scientific. In 1699 Edmund
                    Halley, the astronomer-royal, in command of the “Paramour Pink,” undertook a
                    voyage to improve the knowledge of longitude, and of the variation of the
                    compass. The results of his voyage were the construction of a variation chart,
                    and proposals for finding the longitude by occultations of fixed stars.</p>
                <p>During the 17th century very considerable progress was made in the art of
                    navigation, and in systematizing and delineating the vast mass of material that
                    was accumulated by the ceaseless activity of explorers. The Dutch took the lead
                    as map-makers. Mercator invented the useful projection which bears his name; and
                    Ortelius, Hondius, and Hulsius compiled a series of valuable maps. In finding
                    the latitude at sea, the astrolabe very generally gave place to the cross-staff,
                    because the graduation of the latter was larger and more easily read off. The
                    cross-staff was a very simple instrument, consisting of a graduated pole with
                    cross pieces, called transversaries (of which there were four used according to
                    the altitude), also graduated, which were fitted to work on it. The bearings of
                    the sun were taken by compass, to ascertain when it was near the meridian; then
                    the end of the long staff was placed close to the observer’s eye, and the
                    transversary moved until one end exactly touched the horizon, and the other the
                    sun’s centre. This was continued until the sun dipped, when the meridian
                    altitude was obtained. The back-staff was an improvement on the cross-staff,
                    invented by the great Arctic navigator John Davis. It was fitted with a
                    reflector, and it was thus the first rough idea of the principle of the quadrant
                    and sextant. The cross-staff was used for low altitudes, because both ends of
                    the transversary could easily be seen at the same time, and the astrolabe for
                    high altitudes. With the invention of these instruments came instructions for
                    their use, and for working out observations. In England the first of these was
                    <hi rend="italic">The Old Rutter of the Sea,</hi> printed in 1490. Then followed
                    the <hi rend="italic">Seaman's Secrets</hi> of John Davis, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Regiment of the Sea, containing very necessary Matters, with a perfect Sea
                    Card,</hi> by Thomas Hood, published in 1596. Hood also sold compasses
                    constructed on Mr Norman’s principle, near the Minories. These manuals contained
                    definitions, treatises on the use of the sea card and compass, table3 of
                    declination and rules for applying it, rules for dead reckonings and longitude,
                    and instructions in the use of instruments. Latitude was obtained by
                    observation, but longitude had usually to be reckoned on the chart from the
                    meridian of Grand Canary, which in those days was used by all civilized
                    countries. The differences of time between the eclipses of the moon at the place
                    of the observer and the place for which it was calculated in the <hi
                    rend="italic">ephemerides</hi> for that day was another method in use of finding
                    the difference of longitude. Mariners were also provided with tables giving the
                    number of miles in a degree of longitude for every degree of latitude. Much
                    attention was bestowed upon the phenomena of the variation and dip of the
                    magnetic needle. Robert Norman, the hydrographer, discovered the dip or
                    inclination of the needle in 1576, and in 1581 he observed tie variation of the
                    compass at London, and found it to be 11° 15' E. In the same year his <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourse of the Magnet or Loadstone</hi> was published by
                    Ballard. In 1580 Mr Borough, comptroller of the navy, found the variation of the
                    compass at Limehouse <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> to be 11° 19' E. It may be
                    observed here that in 1657 there was no variation at London, and that it moved
                    westerly until 1815, when it was 24° 27' W. It is now returning eastwards.</p>
                <p>By means of these rough instruments and calculations our Elizabethan navigators
                    and their contemporaries succeeded in delineating the vast regions that were
                    discovered. Thus the sum of human knowledge was augmented, while men’s minds
                    were enlarged, and the wealth and prosperity of nations were increased, through
                    the provision of safe guides by which lands and seas could be traversed, and
                    distant countries visited.</p>
                <p>In the 18th century, to a far greater extent than had ever been the case before,
                    geography began to be cultivated for its own sake, and expeditions were fitted
                    out with the objects of discovery and of acquiring knowledge. The same objects
                    also generally formed part of those enterprises which were avowedly undertaken
                    for conquest, in the search of wealth, or from motives of religious zeal.</p>
                <p>The improvement of scientific apparatus naturally went hand in hand with the
                    progress of discovery. The great desideratum was the means of finding the
                    longitude; and it was the creation of a commission for the discovery of
                    longitude in 1713 which, so far as England is concerned, gave the greatest
                    stimulus to inventions connected with geographical research. To the Board of
                    Longitude is due the conception of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi>
                    and the establishment of a surveying branch of the naval service. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> first appeared in 1767, under the auspices
                    of Dr Maskelyne, the astronomer-royal, who, by furnishing tables of lunar
                    distances, supplied another means of finding the longitude. The invention by
                    Hadley, in 1731, of the quadrant for use at sea, which entirely superseded the
                    astrolabe and cross-staff, was a still greater improvement; and it was soon
                    followed by better instruments on the same principle—the sextants of Dollond and
                    Troughton. The work of travellers on land also became more accurate in
                    proportion as instruments and maps were improved. Early explorers by land were
                    content with itineraries and maps which only indicated distances. The
                    introduction of observations by compass bearings was an important
                    improve-nient<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0201-0188"/>; and after the invention of Hadley’s quadrant,
                    these rough route surveys began to be checked and verified by astronomical
                    observations.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable example of the early application of these improvements is to
                    be found in the survey of China by the Jesuit missionaries. They first prepared
                    a map of the country round Peking, which was submitted to the emperor Kang-hi,
                    and, being satisfied with the accuracy of the European method of surveying, he
                    resolved to have a survey made of the whole empire on the same principles. This
                    great work was commenced in July 1708, and the completed maps were presented to
                    the emperor in 1718. The records preserved in each city were examined,
                    topographical information was diligently collected, and the Jesuit fathers
                    checked their triangulation by meridian altitudes of the sun and pole star, and
                    by a system of remeasurements. The result was a more accurate map of China than
                    existed, at that time, of any country in Europe. Kang-hi next ordered a similar
                    map to be made of Tibet, the survey being executed by two lamas who were
                    carefully trained as surveyors by the Jesuits at Peking. From these surveys were
                    constructed the well-known maps which were forwarded to Duhalde, aud from which
                    D’Anville constructed his atlas.</p>
                <p>Several European missionaries had previously found their way from India to Tibet.
                    Antonio Andrada, in 1624, was the first European to enter Tibet since the visit
                    of Friar Odoric in 1325. The next journey was that of Fathers Grueber and
                    Dorville about 1660, who succeeded in passing from China, through Tibet, into
                    India. In 1715 Fathers Desideri and Freyre made their way from Agra, across the
                    Himâlayas, to Lassa, the capital of Tibet; and the Capuchin Friar Orazio della
                    Penna resided at Lassa from 1735 until 1747. But the most remarkable journey in
                    this direction was performed by a Dutch traveller named Samuel Van de Putte. He
                    is the only European who has ever completed the journey from India, through
                    Lassa, to China, and returned to India by the same route. He left Holland in
                    1718, went by land through Persia to India, and eventually made his way to
                    Lassa, where he resided for a long time. He went thence to China, returned to
                    Lassa, and was in India in time to be an eye-witness of the sack of Delhi by
                    Nadir Shah in 1737. In 1743 he left India, and died at Batavia on the 27 th of
                    September 1745. The premature death of this illustrious traveller is the more to
                    be lamented because his vast knowledge died with him. Two English missions sent
                    by Warren Hastings to Tibet, one led by Mr George Bogle in 1774, and the other
                    by Captain Turner in 1783, completes the list of Tibetan explorers in the 18th
                    century. From Persia much new information was supplied by Chardin, Tavernier,
                    Hamilton, Thevenot, and Krusinski, and by English traders on the Caspian. In
                    1738 John Elton traded between Astrakhan and the Persian port of Enzeli on the
                    Caspian, and undertook to build a fleet for Nadir Shah. Another English
                    merchant, named Jonas Hanway, arrived at Astrabad from Russia, and travelled to
                    the camp of Nadir at Kazvîn. One lasting and valuable result of Hanway’s
                    wanderings was a most charming book of travels. The extension of the dominions
                    of the Company largely increased the knowledge of India. In 1700 Guillaume
                    Delisle, the principal creator of the modern system of geography, published his
                    map of the continents of the Old World; and his successor D’Anville produced his
                    map of India in 1752. D’Anville’s map contained all that was then known, but ten
                    years afterwards Major Rennell commenced his surveying labours, which extended
                    over a period from 1763 to 1782. His survey covered an area 900 miles long by
                    300 wide, from the eastern confines of Bengal to Agra, and from the Himâlayas to
                    Calpi. Rennell was indefatigable in collecting geographical information; his
                    Bengal atlas appeared in 1781, his famous map of India in 1/88, and the memoir
                    in 1/92. Surveys were also made along the Indian coasts, and the chart3 of
                    Huddert, Ritchie, and M'Cluer were the forerunners of the more accurate and
                    elaborate productions of the succeeding century.</p>
                <p>Arabia received very careful attention, in the 18th century, from the Danish
                    scientific mission, which included Carsten Niebuhr among its members. Niebuhr
                    landed at Loheia, on the coast of Yemen, in December 1762, and went by land to
                    Sana. All the other members of the mission died, aud he proceèded from Mocha to
                    Bombay. He then made a journey through Persia and Syria to Constantinople,
                    returning to Copenhagen in 1767. His invaluable work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description of Arabia,</hi> was published in 1772, and was followed in 1774-78
                    by two volumes of travels in Asia. The great traveller survived until 1815, when
                    he died at the age of eighty-two. James Bruce of Kinnaird, the contemporary of
                    Niebuhr, was equally devoted to Eastern travel. After studying Arabic and Geez
                    for some years, he went out as consul to Algiers, and resided there from 1762 to
                    1765, exploring and sketching the Roman ruins in Algiers and Tunis. In 1765 he
                    travelled by land from Tunis to Tripoli, and then took a passage for Candia, but
                    was shipwrecked near Bengazi, and had to swim on shore. He eventually reached
                    Candia, and, sailing thence to Sidon, travelled through Syria. In June 1768 he
                    landed at Alexandria in the dress of an Arab, and soon afterwards we hear of him
                    at Jiddah, the port of Mecca, in the dress of a Turkish sailor. He had resolved
                    to attempt the discovery of the source of the Nile; andin 1769 he landed at
                    Massowah, on the Abyssinian coast. He then penetrated to Axum and Gondar, and in
                    November 1770 he reached the source of the Abai, then supposed to be the main
                    stream of the Nile. He thus attained the great object of his ambition. Returning
                    by the desert into Egypt, Bruce reached England in 1774, and settled once more
                    at his old home at Kinnaird after an absence of ten years. Urged by his old
                    friend, Mr Daines Barrington, the great traveller at length published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile in the Years</hi>
                    1768-73 (5 vols. 4to) in 1790. Bruce, like many other conscientious and
                    deserving explorers, was assailed by calumny and detraction. But every
                    succeeding year has added to the high estimation in which his labours are held,
                    and to the reverence with which his memory is cherished. He died at Kinnaird
                    House, Stirlingshire, iu 1794.</p>
                <p>Before the death of Bruce an African Association was formed, in 1788, for
                    collecting information respecting the interior of that continent, with Major
                    Rennell and Sir Joseph Banks as leading members, and Bryan Edwards as secretary.
                    The association first employed a Mr Ledyard to cross Africa from east to west on
                    the parallel of the Niger, and Mr Lucas to cross the Sahara to Fezzan. Ledyard,
                    who had previously made a most extraordinary journey into Siberia, died at Cairo
                    in 1788. Lucas went from Tripoli to Mesurata, obtained some information
                    respecting Fezzan, and returned in 1789. One of the chief problems the
                    Association wished to solve was that of the existence and course of the river
                    Niger, which Maxwell believed to be identical with the Congo. Mungo Park, then
                    an assistant surgeon of an Indiaman, volunteered his services, which were
                    accepted by the Association, and in 1795 he arrived at the English factory of
                    Pisania, 200 miles up the Gambia. Leaving this station in December he reached
                    Ludamar, where a Moorish chief imprisoned him until the following July. He then
                    crossed a mountainous tract to a Mandingo town called Kamalia. Quite destitute,
                    and suffering from fever, he remained there for several months, but finally
                    found his way back to Pisania, and returned to England. The interesting
                    narrative of his adventures, with a geographical<pb break="no"

                    years afterwards he accepted an offer from the Government to command an
                    expedition into the interior of Africa, the plan being to cross from the Gambia
                    to the Niger, and descend the latter river to the sea. Park left the factory of
                    Pisania, on the Gambia, on the 4th of May 1805, accompanied by Lieutenant Martyn
                    and 35 soldiers, besides guides. All died but four during the rainy season, and
                    the rest, including Mungo Park, perished in a rapid on the Niger, having been
                    attacked from the shore by order of a chief who thought he had not received
                    suitable presents. Park was only thirty-five at the time of his death. The
                    details respecting the fate of the ill-fated explorer and his party were
                    obtained from the guide.</p>
                <p>While the English were at work in the direction of the Niger, the Portuguese
                    -were not unmindful of their old exploring fame. In 1798 Dr Lacerda, an
                    accomplished astronomer, was appointed to command a scientific expedition of
                    discovery to the north of the Zambesi. He started in July, crossed the Muchenja
                    Mountains, and reached the capital of the Cazembe, where he died of fever. Dr
                    Lacerda left a valuable record of his adventurous journey; but with Mungo Park
                    and Lacerda the history of African exploration in the 18th century closes.</p>
                <p>In South America scientific exploration was busily at work during this period.
                    The great event of the century, as regards that continent, was the measurement
                    of an arc of the meridian. The undertaking was proposed by the French Academy,
                    and a commission left Paris in 1735, consisting of La Condamine, Bouguer, and
                    Godin. Spain appointed two accomplished naval officers, the brothers Ulloa, as
                    coadjutors. The operations were carried on during eight years on a plain to the
                    south of Quito; and. in addition to his memoir on this memorable and most
                    important measurement, La Condamine collected much valuable geographical
                    information during a voyage down the Amazon. The arc measured was 3° 7'3" in
                    length; and the work consisted of two measured bases connected by a series of
                    triangles, one north and the other south of the equator, on the meridian of
                    Quito. Contemporaneously, in 1738, M. Maupertuis of St Malo measured an arc of
                    the meridian in Lapland. Another result of this expedition was the publication
                    of a valuable work by the brothers Ulloa.</p>
                <p>The English and French Governments despatched several expeditions of discovery
                    into the Pacific and round the world during the 18th century. They were preceded
                    by those wonderful and romantic voyages of the buccaneers, of such men as Woodes
                    Rogers, Davis, Shelvocke, Clapperton, and Dampier, which can never fail to
                    interest, while they are not without geographical value. The works of Dampier
                    are especially valuable, and the narratives of William Funnell and Lionel Wafer
                    furnished the best accounts then extant of the isthmus of Darien. Dampier’s
                    literary ability eventually secured for him a commission in the king’s service;
                    and he was sent on a voyage of discovery, during which he explored part of the
                    coasts of Australia and New Guinea, and discovered the strait which bears his
                    name between New Guinea and New Britain, returning in 1701. Inl721Jacob
                    Roggewein was despatched on a voyage of some importance across the Pacific by
                    the Dutch West India Company, during which he discovered Eister Island on April
                    6, 1722.</p>
                <p>The voyage of Lord Anson to the Pacific in 1740-44 was of a predatory character,
                    and he lost more than half his men from scurvy; while it is not pleasant to
                    reflect that at the very time when the French and Spaniards were measuring an
                    arc of the meridian at Quito, the English under Anson were pillaging along the
                    coast of the Pacific, and burning the town of Payta. But a romantic interest
                    attaches to the wreck of the “Wager,” one of Anson’s fleet, on a desert island
                    near Chiloe, for it bore fruit in the charming narrative of Byron, which will
                    endure for all time. In 1764 Captain Byron himself was sent on a voyage of
                    discovery round the world, which led immediately after his return, to the
                    despatch of another to complete his work, under the command of Captain
                    Wallis.</p>
                <p>The expedition, consisting of the “Dolphin” commanded by Captain Wallis, and the
                    “Swallow” under Captain Carteret, sailed in September 1766, but the ships were
                    separated on entering the Pacific from the Straits of Magellan. Wallis
                    discovered Tahiti on June 19, 1767, of which island he gave a detailed account,
                    and Sir Charles Saunders’s Island; he returned to England on May 17,1768.
                    Carteret discovered the Charlotte and Gloucester Islands, and Pitcairn Island on
                    July 2, 1767; revisited the Santa Cruz group, which was discovered by Mendana
                    and Quiros; and discovered the strait separating New Britain from New Ireland.
                    He reached Spithead again on February 20, 1769. Wallis and Carteret were
                    followed very closely by the French expedition of Bougainville, which sailed
                    from Nantes in November 1766. Bougainville had first to perform to him the
                    unpleasant task of delivering up the Falkland Islands (Malouines), where he had
                    encouraged the formation of a French settlement, to the Spaniards. He then
                    entered the Pacific, and reached Tahiti on April 2, 1768. Passing through the
                    New Hebrides group he touched at Batavia, and arrived at St Malo after an
                    absence of two years and four months.</p>
                <p>The three voyages of Cook form an era in the history of geographical discovery.
                    All his work was thoroughly and completely done. He systematically surveyed
                    every land he discovered, collecting information touching every branch of
                    inquiry, so that his labours form a very large addition to geographical
                    knowledge. James Cook was born near Whitby, Yorkshire, in 1728, and had been
                    marine surveyor of Newfoundland and Labrador from 1763 to 1767. In the latter
                    year he commissioned the “Endeavour” and sailed for Tahiti, with the object of
                    observing the transit of Venus, accompanied by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander,
                    a pupil of Linnaeus. The transit was observed at Tahiti on June 3, 1769. After
                    exploring Tahiti and the Society group, Cook was six months surveying the two
                    islands of New Zealand, and the coast of New South Wales from latitude 38° S. to
                    the northern extremity. Passing through Torres Strait, he touched at Batavia,
                    and arrived in England on June 12, 1771.</p>
                <p>Cook’s second voyage was mainly intended to explore the region round the
                    Antarctic Circle; and it may be mentioned that meanwhile a French ship,
                    commanded by M. Kerguelen, had sailed southwards in 1771, and discovered the
                    island which bears his name. Captain Cook was provided with two vessels built at
                    Whitby, the “Resolution,” which he himself commanded, and the “Adventure” under
                    Captain Furneaux, who had been with Wallis. After rounding the Cape the two
                    vessels reached a south latitude of 57° 15'. On March 26,1773, Captain Cook
                    arrived at New Zealand and proceeded to the Society Islands, whence he made
                    another voyage southwards between the meridians of 170° E. and 106° 54' W. On
                    this occasion he was stopped by ice in 71° 10' S. During the second voyage Cook
                    visited Easter Island, discovered several islands of the New Hebrides and New
                    Caledonia; and on his way home by Cape Horn, in March 1774, he discovered the
                    Sandwich Island group. Arrived at Spithead on July 30, 1774. The account of the
                    second voyage was written by the young naturalist George Forster, whose
                    subsequent work was so justly eulogized by Humboldt. The third voyage was
                    intended to attempt the passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic by the
                    north-east. The “Resolution” and “Discovery” sailed <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0203-0190"/> in 1776, aud Cook again took the route by the
                    Cape of Good Hope. In 1777 he was at the Friendly group, and on January 18,
                    1778, he discovered the Sandwich Islands. He then proceeded to the North
                    American coast, aud, after a stay of a month in Nootka Sound, he proceeded
                    northwards, fixed the position of the western extremity of America, and surveyed
                    Behring Strait. On August 17, 1778, he was stopped by the ice in 70° 41' N., and
                    named the farthest visible point on the American shore Icy Cape. He then visited
                    the Asiatic shore and discovered Cape North, bearing up on August 29 when he was
                    in the 180th degree of longitude. Returning to the Sandwich Islands, Captain
                    Cook was murdered by the natives of Hawaii. On February 14, 1779, his second,
                    Captain Clerke, took the command, and proceeding to Petropaulowski in the
                    following summer, he again examined the edge of the ice, but only got to 70° 33'
                    N. The ships returned to England in October 1780.</p>
                <p>In 1785 the French Government fitted out a very carefully-prepared expedition of
                    discovery at Brest, which was placed under the command of La Perouse, an
                    accomplished and experienced officer. After touching at Concepcion in Chili, aud
                    at Easter Island, La Perouse proceeded to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to
                    the coaβt of California, of which he has given a very interesting account. He
                    then went across the Pacific to Macao, and in July 1787 he proceeded to explore
                    the Gulf of Tartary and the shores of Saghalien, remaining some time at Castries
                    Bay, so named after the French minister of marine. Thence he went to the Kurile
                    Islands and Kamchatka, and sailed from the far north down a meridian to the
                    Navigator and Friendly Islands. He was in Botany Bay in January 1788; and
                    sailing thence, the explorer, his ship, and crew were never seen again. Their
                    fate was long uncertain. In September 1791 Captain D’Entrecasteaux sailed from
                    Brest with two vessels, to seek for tidings. He visited the New Hebrides, Santa
                    Cruz, New Caledonia, and Salomon Islands, and made careful though rough surveys
                    of the Louisiade Archipelago, islands north of New Britain, and part of New
                    Guinea. D’Entrecasteaux died on board his ship on July 20,1793, without
                    ascertaining the fate of La Perouse. It was Captain Peter Dillon who at length
                    ascertained, in 1828, that the ships of La Perouse were wrecked on the island of
                    Vanikoro during a hurricane.</p>
                <p>The work of Captain Cook bore fruit in many ways. His master, Captain Bligh, was
                    sent in the “Bounty” to convey breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies.
                    He reached Tahiti in October 1788, and in April 1789 a mutiny broke out, and he,
                    with several officers and men, was thrust into an open boat in mid-ocean. During
                    the remarkable voyage he then made to Timor, Captain Bligh passed amongst the
                    northern islands of the New Hebrides, which he named the Banks Group, and made
                    several running surveys. He reached England in March 1790. The “Pandora,” under
                    Captain Edwards, was sent out in search of the “Bounty,” and discovered the
                    islands of Cherry and Mitre, east of the Santa Cruz group, but she was
                    eventually lost on a reef in Torres Strait. In 1796-97 Captain Wilson, in the
                    missionary ship “Duff,” discovered the Gambier and other islands, and
                    rediscovered the islands known to and seen by Quiros, but since called the Duff
                    Group. Another result of Captain Cook’s work was the colonization of Australia.
                    On January 18, 1788, Admiral Phillip and Captain Hunter arrived in Botany Bay in
                    the “Supply” and “Sirius,” followed by six transports, and established a colony
                    at Port Jackson. Surveys were then undertaken in several directions. In 1795 and
                    1796 M. Flinders and G. Bass were engaged on exploring work in a small boat
                    called the “Tom Thumb.” In 1797 Bass, who had been a surgeon, made an expedition
                    southwards, continued the work of Cook from Ram Head, and explored the strait
                    which bears his name, and in 1798 he and Flinders were surveying the east coast
                    of Van Diemen’s Land. The planting of a colony at Port Jackson led to the
                    despatch of an expedition to complete the exploration of the Australian coasts.
                    The command was given to Captain Matthew Flinders. He was furnished with a
                    vessel called the “Investigator,” and sailed from England on July 18,1801.
                    Commencing from King George’s Sound, Captain Flinders discovered and made a
                    preliminary survey of all the south coast of Australia to Bass Strait, and the
                    east coast from the barrier reef to Torres Strait, as well as the east coast of
                    the Gulf of Carpentaria. Flinders met the French expedition under Baudin and
                    Freycinet with the two ships “Géographe” and “Naturaliste,” which was engaged
                    upon the same work. He was taken prisoner by the French jn 1804 and detained
                    until 1810, so that his work did not appear before 1814.</p>
                <p>Yet another out-come of Captain Cook’s work was the voyage of George Vancouver,
                    who had served as a midshipman in Cook’s second and third voyages. The Spaniards
                    under Quadra had commenced a survey of north-western America and occupied Nootka
                    Sound, which their Government eventually agreed to surrender. Captain Vancouver
                    was sent out to receive the cession, and to survey the coast from Cape Mendocino
                    northwards. He commanded the old “Discovery,” and was at work during the seasons
                    of 1792, 1793, and 1794, wintering at the Sandwich Islands. Returning home in
                    1795, be completed his narrative and very valuable series of charts, and died in
                    1798.</p>
                <p>The 18th century saw the Arctic coast of North America reached at two points, as
                    well as the first scientific attempt to reach the North Pole. The Hudson’s Bay
                    Company had been incorporated in 1670, and its servants soon extended their
                    operations over a wide area to the north and west of Canada. In 1741 Captain
                    Christopher Middleton was ordered to solve the question of a passage from
                    Hudson’s Bay to the westward. Leaving Fort Churchill in July 1742 he stood
                    northwards and discovered the Wager River and Repulse Bay, bearing up again on
                    August 9. He was followed by Captain W. Moor in 1746, and Captain Coats in 1751,
                    who examined the Wager Inlet up to the end. On November 6, 1769, Samuel Hearne
                    was sent by the Hudson’s Bay Company to discover the sea on the north side of
                    America, but was obliged to return. On February 23, 1770, he set out again from
                    Fort Prince of Wales; but, after great hardships, he was again forced to return
                    to the fort. He started once more on December 7,1771, and at length reached the
                    Coppermine River, which he surveyed to its mouth, but his observations are very
                    unreliable. With the same object of reaching the sea, Alexander Mackenzie, with
                    a party of Canadians, set out from Fort Chepewyan on June 3, 1789, and descended
                    a river which bears the explorer’s name. His account of the journey is even more
                    unsatisfactory than that of Hearne.</p>
                <p>In February 1773 the Royal Society submitted a proposal to the king for an
                    expedition to try how far navigation was possible towards the Pole. The
                    “Racehorse” and “Carcass” bombs were selected as best adapted for the service,
                    and Captains Phipps and Lutwidge were appointed to command them. The expedition
                    sailed on June 2, 1773, and sighted the coast of Spitzbergen on the 28th.
                    Captain Phipps stood into every opening he could find in the ice, but was
                    invariably stopped by a solid barrier. He examined a line extending over twenty
                    degrees of longitude, and found no opening in the heavy polar pack in any
                    direction. After a very careful and persevering examination of the ice, the
                    expedition returned to England in September. The highest latitude reached was
                    80° 48' N. But the most important Arctic work in the 18th century was performed
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n204/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0204-0191"/> by the Russians, for they succeeded in
                    delineating the whole of the northern coast of Siberia. Some of this work,
                    indeed, was done at a still earlier date. The Cossack Deschneff made an
                    extraordinary voyage, in the summer of 1648, from the river Kolyma, through
                    Behring Strait to Anadyr, a performance which has never since been equalled.
                    Between 1738 and 1750 the mates Manin and Sterlegoff made their way in small
                    sloops from the mouth of the Yenisei as far north as 75° 15' N. The land from
                    Taimyr to Cape Chelyuskin, the most northern extremity of Siberia, was mapped by
                    the mate Chelyuskin, who discovered the extreme point in May 1742. To the east
                    of Cape Chelyuskin the Russians encountered greater difficulties. They built
                    small vessels at Yakutsk on the Lena, 900 miles from its mouth, whence the first
                    expedition was despatched under Lieutenant Prontschicheff in 1735. He sailed
                    from the mouth of the Lena to the mouth of the Olonek, where he wintered, and on
                    September 1, 1736, he got as far as 77° 29' N., within five miles of Cape
                    Chelyuskin, which is in 77° 34' N. Both he and his young wife died of scurvy,
                    and the vessel returned. A second expedition, uuder Lieutenant Laptieff, started
                    from the Lena in 1739, but encountered masses of drift ice in Chatanga bay, and
                    with this ended the voyages to the westward of the Lena. Several attempts were
                    also made to navigate the sea from the Lena to the Kolyma. In 1736 Lieutenant
                    Laptieff sailed, but was stopped by the drift ice in August, and in 1739, during
                    another trial, he reached the mouth of the Indigirka, where he wintered. In the
                    season of 1740 he continued his voyage to beyond the Kolyma, wintering at Nijni
                    Kolymsk. In 1725 Vitus Behring, a Dane in the Russian service, received his
                    instructions from Peter the Great a few days before the czar’s death. Two
                    vessels were built for Behring at Okhotsk, and sailing in July 1728, he
                    ascertained the existence of the strait between Asia and America which bears his
                    name. In September 1740 Behring again sailed from Okhotsk, with Steller on board
                    as naturalist. In June 1741 Commodore Behring named the magnificent peak on the
                    coast of North America Mount St Elias, and explored the Aleutian Islands. In
                    November the ship was wrecked on Behring Island; and the gallant Dane, worn out
                    with scurvy, died there on the 8th of December 1741. In March 1770 amerchant
                    named Liakhoff saw a large herd of reindeer coming from the north to the
                    Siberian coast, which induced him to start in a sledge in the direction whence
                    they came. Thus the New Siberian Islands were discovered, and for years
                    afterwards the seekers for fossil ivory resorted to them. The Russian Captain
                    Vassili Tchitschakoff in 1765 and 1766 made two persevering attempts to
                    penetrate the ice north of Spitzbergen, and reached to 80° 30' N., and Russian
                    parties twice wintered at Bell Sound. But the result was the same as all others
                    have obtained before and since; the Spitzbergen route is evidently not the way
                    to the Pole.</p>
                <p>The 18th century saw great progress in the collection and arrangement of
                    geographical material, and in the work of surveying and map-making. Collections
                    of voyages and travels were brought together in the four quarto volumes of
                    Astley (1745) and the two folios of Harris (1764); while Dr Hawkesworth edited
                    the Government voyages to the Pacific in 1773. Sir Joseph Banks was the great
                    patron of geography in England, aided by the indefatigable labours of such
                    critical geographers as Rennell, Dalrymple, and Barrington; while in France the
                    great cartographer D’Anville introduced a habit of critical accuracy, and caused
                    a complete revolution in the art of mapmaking.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the century it was recognized that geography served more
                    extensive and important uses than had ever before been supposed. The route
                    survey was sufficient for the traveller or soldier, while accurate charts guided
                    the mariner across the ocean. But surveys are also the basis of statistics and
                    of administration, and rigorous accuracy became necessary. Surveys on a
                    trigonometrical basis, which have been proceeding in all the countries in Europe
                    (except Turkey) and in India during the present, were commenced in the last
                    century. In Great Britain the Ordnance Survey was begun in April 1784, when
                    General Roy measured a base line on Hounslow Heath. The triangulation of the
                    British Isles was commenced in 1784 and completed in 1852. Maps based on
                    trigonometrical surveys may eventually explain and illustrate the physical
                    aspect of the whole globe, but at present they are necessarily confined to those
                    nations which are in the front rank of civilization. Countries which are not so
                    advanced are still obliged to be content with such maps as sufficed for all the
                    world in the last century, before the results of trigonometrical surveys were
                    available. These secondary maps are adapted for the requirements of the
                    countries which use them, being based on positions fixed by astronomical
                    observations, on cross bearings, and often on chained distances. The third class
                    of maps includes the work of explorers of unknown or little known regions, and
                    of geographers who delineate the features of such regions by compilation and by
                    intelligent collation of the work of travellers. There are thus three grand
                    divisions in the character and uses of maps. There are first those which aim at
                    minute accuracy, and which are intended as documents for administrative
                    purposes, and in pursuing exact statistical investigations. Secondly, there are
                    maps which are based on less accurate surveys of countries less populous or less
                    advanced in civilization; these are useful for political, geographical, and
                    military purposes, but are not to be relied on to the same extent or in the same
                    way as is the case with those based on trigonometrical surveys. Thirdly, there
                    are the roughly compiled maps of little known regions, which are constantly in
                    course of improvement, and which do the work of pioneers.</p>
                <p>In treating here of the progress of geographical discovery in the present
                    century, it is to those who prepare the last class of maps, to the pioneers—the
                    discoverers—that we must mainly, though not exclusively, confine our attention.
                    We propose to review the work of discoverers and explorers of the 19th century
                    in two sections as regards time,—first during the first thirty, and secondly
                    during the last fortyeight years. The Royal Geographical Society was founded in
                    1830, and forms a landmark. In each period we shall take first the work done in
                    Asia, then Africa, then America, then Australia, then Polynesia, and finally the
                    Arctic and Antarctic regions.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the century British rule in India was extended over the
                    plains of the Ganges almost to the Sutlej, and the attention of explorers was
                    drawn to the mighty mass of the Himâlayas. Captain Herbert, in 1818, at-temped
                    to give a general view of the physical character of this great range, and
                    Moorcroft reached the Mansarowa lake, and the upper courses of the Indus and
                    Sutlej; while Mr Manning, in 1811, was the only Englishman who ever visited
                    Lassa, the capital of Tibet. The mission of Sir John Malcolm to Persia in 1808
                    led to much geographical work being achieved. On his staff was Macdonald
                    Kinneir, who wrote a valuable memoir on the geography of Persia; while at the
                    same time Lieutenant J. Macartney, under Mountstuart Elphinstone, was collecting
                    materials for a map of Afghanistan. In 1810 Pöttinger and Christie made an
                    important journey through Baluchistan by different routes, Christie afterwards
                    visiting Herat and Yezd; and in 1827 Mr Stirling of the Bengal Civil Service
                    crossed the HazArah mountains.</p>
                <p>The close of the war in 1815 led to numerous efforts for <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0205-0192"/> the furtherance of geographical discovery,
                    especially in Africa and the far north. In 1818 to 1820 Captain Lyon, R.N., and
                    Mr Ritchie landed at Tripoli, and penetrated as far as Mourzouk; and this led to
                    the more important expedition of Major Denham and Captain Clapperton, R.N.,
                    which was despatched by the Government. They landed at Tripoli in 1823, and
                    advanced into the interior as fur as the east coast of Lake Tchad, of which they
                    gave a most interesting account, obtaining latitudes by meridian altitudes and
                    longitudes by lunar observations. Clapperton’s furthest point was at Saccatoo,
                    westward of the lake, and here he was forced to turn back. But in 1825 he was
                    again employed to explore the interior of Africa, and this time he started from
                    the Atlantic side with his faithful servant Richard Lander. Landing in the Bight
                    of Benin, he succeeded in reaching Saccatoo from the west side, thus completing
                    a route from Tripoli on the Mediterranean to the coast of Guinea. But at
                    Saccatoo the gallant sailor succumbed at last, dying on the 13th of April 1827.
                    His faithful servant Lauder returned to the coast; aud in 1830 he and his
                    brother were employed to explore the course of the Niger or Quorra. They
                    embarked on the river near Boossa, passed through the Yorriba country, and came
                    out at the mouth of the Nun.</p>
                <p>The Admiralty also considered that a river of such magnitude as the Zaire or
                    Congo ought to be explored. Captain Tuckey, R.N., was selected to conduct the
                    Congo expedition, and received command of a steamer called the “Congo,” with a
                    crew of 49 officers and men. The expedition reached the mouth of the great river
                    on July 5, 1816, and proceeded up to the foot of the falls of Yellala, the
                    farthest point hitherto reached. Captain Tuckey, with 15 of his party, landed on
                    the north shore on the 14th of August; and, after travelling for about 40 miles
                    over a hilly country, he reached the head of the falls and the banks of the
                    upper river. He had explored the river for a distance of 280 miles from the sea.
                    But death overtook the commander of the expedition and several officers, and the
                    “Congo” returned in command of the master, Mr Fitzmaurice, after executing the
                    survey from the foot of the falls to Embomma.</p>
                <p>South America had produced two eminent physical geographers, namely, Caldas of
                    Bogota and Unanue of Lima, before the scenery of the Orinoco and the Andes
                    became familiar to Europe through the charming narratives of Humboldt. It was in
                    1799 that the great Prussian naturalist embarked at Coruna, and landed at Cumana
                    on the coast of Venezuela. His observant eye and bright imagination, combined
                    with habits of scientific thought, produced pictures of the physical aspects of
                    the regions he explored which are quite unequalled. What he said of George
                    Forster is even more true of himself: “He depicted in pleasing colours the
                    changing stages of vegetation, the relations of climate and articles of food in
                    their influence on the civilization of mankind. All that can give truth,
                    individuality, and distinctiveness to the delineation of exotic nature is united
                    in his work.” The Orinoco and Cassiquiari, the falls of Tequendama, the
                    mountains of Quindiu, Chimborazo, and Quito, Cajamarca, and the upper Amazon,
                    and the varied scenery of Mexico, are imprinted on the imagination with
                    life-like form and colouring by this great master of description. His service to
                    geography was far greater than that of any mere discoverer. Humboldt left the
                    New World in 1804.</p>
                <p>The greatest and most important enterprise, after the peace of 1815, was the
                    renewal of Arctic exploration under the auspices of Sir John Barrow. To the
                    great work of Scoresby, and to the careful observations of himself and his
                    father, we are indebted for the most exhaustive account of the Spitzbergen seas,
                    and of the ice which encumbere them. When the Government expeditions were
                    undertaken, the volumes of Scoresby formed a storehouse of useful and
                    well-digested information. The true object of modern Arctic enterprise has been
                    the advancement of science, a noble and sufficient reason for incurring
                    expenditure and facing dangers and hardships. In consequence of Sir John
                    Barrow’s representations, orders were given in 1818 for the preparation of four
                    vessels for Arctic service,—two to attempt the passage from the Atlantic to the
                    Pacific, and two to attempt an approach to the North Pole. But, as Sir John
                    Barrow himself explained, the main objects were not the accomplishment of
                    voyages by these routes, but the acquisition of useful knowledge. Sir John Ross,
                    who commanded one of the two expeditions, circumnavigated Baffin’s Bay on the
                    track of that great navigator, and re-established his fame. Captain Buchan, who
                    led the other, battled with the impenetrable pack to the north of Spitzbergen,
                    like Phipps before him, and then returned. There can be no great success without
                    continuity of effort and perseverance, and the early voyages of this century
                    achieved lasting results, because those who sent them out were endowed with
                    tenacity of purpose. No sooner had Ross returned than Parry was appointed to
                    command two strongly built vessels, the “Hecla” and “Griper,” and to proceed on
                    the same service. On the 11th of May 1819 Parry sailed, and on the 1st of August
                    he entered the portals of Lancaster Sound, and commenced the discovery of a new
                    region. He succeeded in sailing for 300 miles along the southern shores of the
                    islands which now bear his name, among ice floes of moderate thickness, until he
                    reached the edge of the impenetrable polar pack at the western extreme of
                    Melville Island. He went as far as it will ever be possible for any vessel to go
                    in this direction, and then wintered in a harbour of Melville Island. In 1820 he
                    returned with a rich harvest of scientific observations, and of valuable
                    information in all branches of inquiry. This first expedition was most
                    successful. Parry’s second voyage was into Hudson’s Bay in search of a passage
                    westward in that direction. He discovered a strait (that of “Fury and Hecla”),
                    and passed two winters 1821-23 on the coast of Melville Peninsula. The third
                    voyage (1824-25) was again up Baffin’s Bay; but it was unsuccessful, and one of
                    his vessels, the “Fury,” was lost. Still every voyage, whether successful or not
                    in its main object, brought back valuable results. Meanwhile the “Griper,”
                    commanded by Captain Clavering, had, in 1823, penetrated through the ice to the
                    east coast of Greenland in 76° N., to enable Captain Sabine to take pendulum
                    observations in that position. The Russian Captain Lutke had also surveyed the
                    west coast of Novaya Zemlya from 1821 to 1824. Parry, after his return from the
                    third voyage, proposed an attempt to reach the Pole by travelling over the ice
                    during the summer, on the Spitzbergen meridians. He sailed on this service in
                    the “Hecla” ou the 3d of April 1827, and, after placing her in a secure harbour
                    in Spitzbergen, he began his bold and interesting attempt with two boats, fitted
                    with runners for being dragged over the ice. But the whole mass of ice was
                    drifting south faster than Parry’s men, with all their efforts, could advance
                    north. However, on July 23, 1827, he attained the latitude of 82° 45' N., which
                    continued to be the highest parallel ever reached by man until Captain Markham
                    went beyond it in 1875. Parry returned to England in October. Another expedition
                    of a private character left England in June 1829 under the command of Sir John
                    Ross, who was accompanied by his distinguished nephew James C. Ross. In August
                    they reached Lancaster Sound, and then proceeded southwards down Regent’s Inlet,
                    wintering on the most northern peninsula of America, to which Ross gave the name
                    of Boothia. Here they passed three winters, while, during the intervening <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0206-0193"/> summers, some exploring work was accomplished,
                    and James Ross planted the Union Jack on the North Magnetic Pole on the 1st of
                    June 1831. At last they were forced to abandon their little vessel the
                    “Victory,” and make their way to the whalers in Baffin’s Bay in open boats. They
                    were picked up and arrived in England after an absence of four years.</p>
                <p>While these bold and perilous voyages were being conducted in the Arctic seas, a
                    series of land journeys completed the delineation of the northern coast of
                    America, which had just been touched at two points in the last century, by
                    Hearne and Mackenzie. From 1819 to 1823 the gallant Sir John Franklin, with Dr
                    Richardson and George Back, were struggling to explore the Arctic coast eastward
                    from the mouth of the Coppermine River. After great sufferings they embarked on
                    the river on June 30, 1820, reaching the mouth on July 18, and exploring 550
                    miles of coast line to the eastward, as far as Point Turnagain. On the return
                    journey across the barren lands, the party escaped death from starvation almost
                    by a miracle. Undaunted by this terrible experience, Franklin, Richardson, and
                    Back started on another expedition in 1825, this time by descending the
                    Mackenzie River. Reaching its mouth on July 7, Franklin and Back discovered 374
                    miles of coast to the westward, as far as Return Reef; while Richardson explored
                    the space between the mouths of the Mackenzie and Coppermine. In 1833 Back
                    undertook a third journey with the object of succouring the Rosses, who had long
                    been missing. He discovered and explored the Back or Great Fish River for 530
                    miles, and in July 1834 reached its mouth in the Arctic Ocean. The gaps on the
                    north coast, which were left by Franklin and Back, were subsequently filled in
                    by servants of the Hudson’s Bay Company. In 1837 Messrs Simpson and Dease, in a
                    boat, connected Return Reef with Cape Barrow. In 1839 the same explorers went
                    from Cape Turnagain to the mouth of Back’s River, and still further eastward to
                    Castor and Pollux River. On August 26, 1839, Simpson built a cairn at Cape
                    Herschel, on King William Island, separated by a strait ten miles wide from the
                    mainland. Dr Rae was sent in 1846 to winter in Repulse Bay, and in 1847 he
                    travelled round the Gulf of Akkoolee and connected the work of Ross in Boothia
                    with that of Parry during his second voyage. In 1854 he united the work of Ross
                    with that of Simpson, and ascertained that Boothia was connected with the
                    mainland of America by an isthmus. Thus the whole northern coast of America was
                    explored and delineated without a break.</p>
                <p>The Russians were engaged on daring Arctic exploration at the same time. In 1809
                    to 1812 a Russian officer named Hedenstrom surveyed the New Siberia Islands; and
                    in 1821 Lieutenant Anjou made further investigations respecting the state of the
                    ice to the northward. Baron Wrangell prosecuted similar researches from his
                    headquarters at Nijni Kolymsk, near the mouth of the Kolyma. He made four sledge
                    journeys over the Polar Sea from 1820 to 1823, exploring the coast from the
                    Kolyma to Cape Chelagskoi, and making several attempts to advance northwards,
                    but always encountering weak ice. Wrangell’s interesting narrative is an
                    important addition to Arctic literature.</p>
                <p>The Russians, as well as the French, sent several voyages into the Pacific during
                    the first half of the 19th century. In 1804 Admiral Krusenstern made a voyage
                    round the world, and his pupil, Otto von Kotzebue, son of the dramatist,
                    commanded the “Rurick”from 1815 to 1818 on a voyage of discovery. He discovered
                    the great bay known as Kotzebue Sound, sounded in Behring Strait, and made
                    careful observations of the currents. Wintering in California he returned to the
                    Aleutian Islands in the following spring’; and during the voyage homewards he
                    discovered several new islands in the Pacific, especially Romanzoff and
                    Krusenstern in the Dangerous Archipelago. During another Russian voyage,
                    commanded by Billinghausen, Lazareff and other coral islands in the Dangerous
                    Archipelago were discovered, and in 1828 Captain Lutke, in the “Seniavine,”
                    surveyed the Caroline group. Captain Freycinet, the officer who served with
                    Baudin and edited his work, also examined the Caroline Islands in the “Uranie”
                    in 1819, but his voyage was mainly in the interests of natural history. Duperry
                    in 1822-23 did some surveying work on the coast of New Ireland. But the most
                    important French voyage was that of Dumont D’Urville, who was sent out to seek
                    for traces of La Perouse in 1828. He visited Tecopia and other islands in the
                    “Astrolabe,” and was nearly a month at Vanikoro collecting relics of the
                    ill-fated expedition. The voyage of D’Urville contributed largely to the
                    advancement of science, and resulted in the publication of a magnificent work in
                    1830.</p>
                <p>The only English scientific voyage to the Pacific in this period was sent out
                    mainly to co-operate with Parry in his third voyage, and Franklin in his second
                    journey. It was commanded by Captain Beechey, who had been first lieutenant with
                    Parry during his first Arctic voyage, and on May 19, 1825, he sailed from
                    Spithead in H.M.S. “Blossom.” After visiting Easter, Gambier, Pitcairn, and
                    other islands, the “Blossom” arrived at Honolulu on May 20, 1826, and in July
                    she was in Behring Strait, entering Kotzebue Sound on the 22d. Proceeding along
                    the north coast of America, the ship’s barge got as far as 156° 2Γ W. to a low
                    cape called Point Barrow, at the very time when Franklin and Back were at Return
                    Reef. The accurate examination of the coast was made under circumstances which
                    demanded great fortitude and perseverance, and reflects credit on the officers
                    and crew. The “Blossom” returned to Honolulu in January 1827, and arrived at
                    Macao on the 12 th of April. Captain Beechey next proceeded to survey the Loo
                    Choo and Bonin Islands, and, after another visit to the far north, and the
                    coasts of California and Mexico, he returned home by Cape Horn and arrived at
                    Woolwich on October 12, 1828. His valuable and interesting narrative, in two
                    volumes, was published in 1831. Mr Janies Weddell, a master in the navy, made a
                    voyage to the Antarctic Ocean in 1822-24, and went as far south as 74 <hi

                <p>The Royal Geographical Society was founded in 1830, and forms a landmark in the
                    history of discovery. The men who initiated the idea and gave it shape were Sir
                    John Barrow, Sir John Cam Hobhouse, Sir Roderick Murchison, Mr Robert Brown <hi
                    rend="italic">(fPrvncep&gt;s</hi><hi rend="italic">Botanicorum),</hi> and Mr
                    Bartie Frere. They formed the Foundation Committee. The first president was Lord
                    Goderich, and the vice-presidents Sir John Barrow, Colonel Leake, Sir John
                    Franklin, and Mr Greenough. Through this organization explorers and students
                    were encouraged and assisted, information was systematically collected and
                    arranged, and the work of discovery was advanced. A similar society in Paris
                    preceded that of London in point of time, and now every civilized country has
                    established a Geographical Society.</p>
                <p>Our rapid review of the progress of discovery since the foundation of the
                    Geographical Society will commence with the continent of Asia, where there were
                    and still are vast and most interesting unexplored regions. In British India the
                    Trigonometrical Survey has been proceeded with, and is now approaching
                    completion. During its progress the Himâlayan peaks were measured, and in 1848
                    Sir Andrew Waugh fixed the height of the loftiest, which he named Mount Everest,
                    at 29,002 feet above the sea. In 1831 Humboldt published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asie Centrale,</hi> which, with the <hi rend="italic">Erdkunde von Asien</hi>
                    of Carl Ritter, gave new and clearer ideas of the orography of Central Asia.
                    Many travellers explored the remoter parts of the Himâlayan chain; while, in
                    1848, Dr Hooker in Sikkim, and Dr Thomson in Ladak, <pb break="no"

                    Tibet and Yarkand. Our relations with Afghanistan led to further exploration. In
                    1840 Lieutenants Abbott, Conolly, and Shakespear visited Khiva, and in 1841
                    Colonels Stoddart and Conolly were murdered at Bokhara, while Eldred Pöttinger
                    gallantly defended Herat. Sir Alexander Burnes had previously made his
                    remarkable journey from Cabul to Bokhara and back through Persia, and in 1838
                    Lieutenant Wood of the Indian Navy discovered the source of the Oxus. Butakoff
                    and other Russian officers, in 1848 and subsequent years, surveyed the sea of
                    Aral, and Middendorf made extensive explorations and discoveries in Siberia.
                    After the Afghan war it was long before any progress was made in the exploration
                    of Central Asia, but through the opening of the treaty ports in China and the
                    navigation of the Yangtsze a considerable increase was made in our knowledge of
                    the Celestial Empire. In 1869 Mr R. B. Shaw and Mr Haywood reached the cities of
                    Yarkand and Kashgar, and Mr Shaw published a most graphic account of the
                    physical aspects of Eastern Turkestan. In the previous year Mr Ney Elias
                    surveyed the Yellow River of China, and afterwards made a journey through a
                    previously unknown portion of western Mongolia; and during 1866-68 the
                    distinguished French geographer Lieutenant Garnier surveyed the course of the
                    great Cambodian river. The Russians, meanwhile, in their advance into Central
                    Asia, had enabled scientific travellers like Fedchenko and others to explore
                    Khokand and the northern part of the Pamir, and the more adventurous Prjewalski
                    made important journeys through Mongolia and to the frontiers of Tibet. Colonels
                    Walker and Montgomerie, of the great Trigonometrical Survey of India, organized
                    a system of training native explorers, who made journeys across the Pamir and to
                    the upper waters of the Oxus, as well as through the previously unknown parts of
                    Tibet. In the last mission of Sir Douglas Forsyth to Kashgar, Captain Trotter of
                    the Trigonometrical Survey of India formed one of the staff. He did much
                    valuable exploring work on the Pamir table-land, and verified the work of
                    Lieutenant Wood at the source of the Oxus. In 1845 MM. Hue and Gabet travelled
                    through Tibet; and in western China the French missionaries have since done
                    useful geographical work. English diplomatic officers have found their way from
                    the south-western provinces of China into Burmah, and Baron Richthofen has made
                    very extensive exploring journeys through the Chinese empire. The most important
                    journey across Arabia in the present century was made by Mr W. Gifford Palgrave
                    in 1863.</p>
                <p>Geographical discoverers of the 19th century have had a great work to do in
                    Africa. D’Anville and his successors cleared off all that was uncertain on the
                    map, all that had come from the information given by Duarte Lopez to Pigafetta,
                    and from Leo Africanus, and left a great blank. James Bruce and Mungo Park,
                    Clapperton and Tuckey, merely touched the edges or penetrated in single lines
                    across the vast unknown area. But they have been followed by many others, and
                    now great progress has been made. In 1831 Monteiro and Gamitta were sent by the
                    Portuguese Government, in the footsteps of La Cerda, to the capital of Cazembe;
                    while, in 1849 and 1843-47, Ladislaus Magyar and Graςa explored some of the
                    southern affluents of the Congo. Rüppell (1838), Harris (1843), and Dr Beke
                    (1840), Lefebvre and Dillon (1839—43), Ferret and Galinier (1847) improved the
                    existing knowledge of Abyssinia, to which a further important contribution was
                    made by the expeditionary field force sent in 1867— 68 to enforce the release of
                    English captives; and progress was made, under the auspices of the Egyptian
                    Government, in exploring the White Nile above Khartoum. In 1849 the discoveries
                    of Denham and Clapperton were followed up by Richardson, Overweg, and Barth,
                    who, like their predecessors, went from Tripoli to Mourzouk, the capital of
                    Fezzan. The two first died in Africa, but Dr Barth returned home with a rich
                    harvest of results. He reached Kouka the capital of Bornou, on Lake Tchad, and
                    in 1851 he visited the south side of that lake, and advanced some distance to
                    the eastward. In 1852 he was at Saccatoo, where Clapperton died, whence he
                    crossed the Niger and eventually reached Timbuctoo. After a stay of some months
                    Dr Barth left Timbuctoo in March 1854, and got back to Tripoli in the end of
                    1855, being the sole survivor of his party. Dr Vogel, in 1853-57, followed up
                    the discoveries in the direction of Lake Tchad, and fell a victim to science;
                    and the researches of Dr Baikie in 1854 supplemented the work of the Landers in
                    the lower part of the course of the Niger. Dr Baikie also explored 250 miles of
                    the river Chadda or Benue.</p>
                <p>On the eastern coast of Africa, the missionaries Rebmann and Krapf ascertained
                    the existence of the snowy peaks of Kenia and Kilimanjaro near the equator, and
                    collected reports touching the equatorial lakes in the interior. This led to the
                    expedition of Captain Burton in 1857, who, accompanied by Captain Speke, landed
                    opposite to Zanzibar, and, advancing westward, discovered Lake Tanganyika.
                    Captain Burton’s admirable description of the region between the coast and the
                    great lake he had discovered is one of the most valuable contributions to
                    African descriptive geography. His companion, Captain Speke, made an excursion
                    northwards to the southern coast of a lake which he judged to be a main source
                    of the Nile. In this belief he again set out in 1860 to attempt the achievement
                    of a journey from Bagamoyo, opposite Zanzibar, to the Nile. This great
                    enterprise was crowned with success. Speke traced out the western shore, and
                    visited the northern outlet, of the Victoria Nyanza, the main reservoir of the
                    White Nile. He then marched northwards to Gondokoro and descended the Nile. He
                    had heard of a second great Nile reservoir, which Sir Samuel Baker discovered in
                    1864, and named the Albert Nyanza. The Bahr el Ghazal and other western feeders
                    of the Nile were visited by Consul Petherick, and explored in 1868-71 by Dr
                    Schweinfurth, whose work ranks with that of Burton as a record of African
                    discovery.</p>
                <p>The travels of Dr Livingstone in Southern Africa also added considerably to our
                    knowledge of the geography of that continent. In 1848 he started from Cape
                    Colony, visited Lake Ngami in 1849, and eventually reached the Portuguese town
                    of St Paul Loanda in 1855. Thence he marched across the continent, discovering
                    the great falls and a considerable part of the course of the Zambesi. In his
                    second expedition he proceeded up the Zambesi and its tributary the Shire, and
                    discovered the Lake Nyassa. On his third and last expedition he landed on the
                    east coast at the mouth of the Rovuma, and made his way thence to Lake Nyassa.
                    The great traveller then followed in the footsteps of Dr Lacerda and Monteiro to
                    the Cazembe’s capital, and thence to Lake Tanganyika. From Ujiji, on that lake,
                    he made his way westward to the river Lualaba (the upper course of the Congo),
                    and returning in a destitute condition to Ujiji, he was there succoured by Mr
                    Stanley. Finally he once more started, and died in the midst of his discoveries
                    among the remoter sources of the Congo. Lieutenant Cameron’s expedition in 1873
                    had for its main object the succour of Livingstone, but the news of the great
                    traveller’s death was received at Unyanyembe. Cameron then continued his march
                    by a new route to Ujiji, and completed the survey of the southern half of Lake
                    Tanganyika, discovering the Lukuga ©utlet. Thence he advanced westward across
                    the Manyuema country to Livingstone’s furthest point at Nyangwe, crossed the
                    Lualaba, and traversed the whole width of the African continent, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n208/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0208-0195"/> reaching St Paul Loan da on the west coast. Sir
                    Stanley followed in 1874. He circumnavigated and fixed the outline of the
                    Victoria Nyanza, followed Cameron across Lake Tanganyika to Nyangwe, and then
                    descended the great River Congo, discovering its course, and connecting the work
                    of Livingstone with that of Tuckey. Mr Young has since completed the survey of
                    Lake Nyassa; Nachtigal has supplemented the work of Barth and Vogel in the Tchad
                    region; while Duveyrier and other French explorers have examined the region of
                    the Sahara. In the far south the Limpopo basin, and the country intervening
                    between the Limpopo and Zambesi, have been made known to us by St Vincent
                    Erskine and Elton, Carl Mauch and Baines. Thus the extent of the unknown parts
                    of Africa has been rapidly curtailed, while our knowledge has been widened
                    during the last half century.</p>
                <p>On the American continent scientific progress has been made in the United States
                    and the dominion of Canada, where, within the last half century, boundary
                    commissions and surveys have fixed positions and described previously unknown
                    regions of great extent. In South America there are vast unexplored regions to
                    the eastward of the Andes, and in the basins of the great rivers. Sir Robert
                    Schomburgk did much valuable work in Guiana, and explored the delta of the
                    Orinoco in 1841; while Spix and Martius, Poeppig and Castelnau, Maw and Smyth,
                    Herndon and Gibbon, Spruce and Bates, Wallace and Chandless, and others,
                    explored the basin of the Amazon. The labours of Pissis in Chili, of Raimondi
                    and Werthermann in Peru, of Codazzi in Colombia and Venezuela, and of Morales
                    and others in the Argentine Republic, have been most valuable to⅛eographical
                    science. In Patagonia, Fitz Roy’and King explored the Santa Cruz river, Cox and
                    Morales have since added to our knowledge, and Commander Musters, R.N., was the
                    first traveller who traversed the whole of Patagonia from south to north, 960
                    miles of latitude, of which 780 were previously unknown to Europeans.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of exploring the interior of the Australian continent was caused
                    by. the scarcity of water, and the immense distances it was necessary to cross
                    without supplies of any kind. Hence the work of exploration has required and
                    called forth high and noble qualities in a degree quite equal to any that have
                    been recorded in any other part of the world. The names of Sturt and Leichhardt,
                    of Eyre and Grey, of Macdouall Stewart and Burke, of Gregory, of Forrest and
                    Warburton, will be handed down as those of intrepid and courageous explorers who
                    laid open the secrets of the interior of Australia.</p>
                <p>The Pacific Ocean was explored by numerous expeditions during the 18th and early
                    part of the 19th centuries. Still much remained to be done in the way of
                    verification and more complete survey. From 1826 to 1836 Captain Fitzroy, with
                    the naturalist Darwin, surveyed Magellan’s Strait and the west coast of South
                    America; and further important surveys in the Pacific were afterwards executed
                    by Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy, and by Belcher, Kellett, and
                    Denham.</p>
                <p>But the great geographical work of the present century must be the extension of
                    discovery in the Arctic and A.ntarctic regions. Progress has been made in both
                    directions, and in both much remains to be done. It is this polar work which
                    calls forth the highest qualities of an explorer; it is here that the greatest
                    difficulties must be overcome; and it is here that the most valuable scientific
                    results are to be obtained.</p>
                <p>Between the years 1830 and 1843 much was done in the Antarctic regions. In
                    1830-32 Mr John Biscoe, R.N., made a voyage in a brig belonging to Messrs
                    Enderby, and discovered “Enderby Land” and “Graham Land” in 67° S.; and from
                    1837 to 1840 Dumont d’Urville discovered “La Terre Adèle” and “Coté Clarie,”
                    going as far south as 66° 30'. Auckland Island was discovered by Bristow in
                    1806. In 1839 Balleny, in another vessel belonging to Messrs Enderby, discovered
                    the Balleny Islands in 66° 44' S., and Sabrina Island in 65° 10' S. The
                    Antarctic expedition of Sir James Ross sailed from England in 1839. In 1840 Sir
                    James explored Kerguelen Island, and wintered at Hobart Town. He then visited
                    the Auckland Islands, and, crossing the Antarctic Circle, reached the great icy
                    barrier, and discovered Victoria Land, with its lofty volcanoes, in January
                    1841. He gained the latitude of 78° 4' S. in 187° E., and established the
                    continuity of the southern continent from 70° to 79° S. In 1841 Ross again
                    wintered at Van Diemen’s Land, and in January 1842 crossed the Antarctic circle
                    in 156° 28' W. He was once more stopped by the great icy barrier in 78° 10' S.,
                    after having penetrated through ice floes of more than 1000 miles in width.
                    Extraordinary dangers were encountered in the ice, many valuable observations
                    were taken, and in 1842 the expedition wintered at the Falkland Islands. In the
                    following season another exploring voyage was made beyond the Antarctic Circle,
                    and in September 1843 this most important expedition returned to England.</p>
                <p>On the return of Sir James Ross attention was once more turned to the Arctic
                    regions; and in the spring of 1845 Sir John Franklin’s Arctic expedition,
                    consisting of the “Erebus” and “Terror,” sailed from Woolwich. His instructions
                    were to make the North-West Passage, but the main object of the expedition was
                    the advancement of science, and to secure it the most accomplished officers in
                    the navy were appointed, as well as the eminent naturalist Dr Goodsir. It is now
                    known that, in the first and second seasons, the expedition was very successful.
                    In 1845 Sir John Franklin made a remarkable run up Wellington Channel to 77 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> N.; in 1846, proceeding south, he had almost achieved
                    the North-West Passage when his ships were permanently beset to the north of
                    King William Island in 70° 5' N. and 98° 23' W. Here the veteran explorer died
                    on June 11, 1847; and all his companions perished in the attempt to reach one of
                    the Hudson’s Bay Company’s settlements in the summer of 1848. Those among them
                    who reached Cape Herschel, and it is certain that some did reach that point,
                    undoubtedly discovered the North-West Passage.</p>
                <p>The expeditions which were sent out in search of Sir John Franklin’s ships did
                    much important geographical work; but their principal use was the establishment,
                    through their means, of the true method of extensive Arctic exploration. The
                    grand object of the officers and men employed on this service was the relief of
                    their missing countrymen, and their utmost efforts were devoted to the
                    examination of the largest possible extent of coast-line. Hence the discovery of
                    the modern system of Arctic sledge travelling, the only efficient means of
                    exploring the icy regions around the North Pole. In 1848-49 Sir James Ross
                    discovered the western side of North Somerset, and Sir Leopold M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Clintock served his first apprenticeship in the ice
                    under that veteran explorer. Austin’s expedition sailed in 1850, and wintered
                    nearly in the centre of the region discovered by Parry during his first voyage.
                    It was then that M*Clintock developed and put in practice the system of Arctic
                    sledgetravelling which has since achieved such grand results; and Captain
                    Ommanney, M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clintock, and his colleagues Sherard
                    Osborn, Frederick Mecham, Robert Aldrich, and Vesey Hamilton made what were then
                    unparalleled journeys in various directions. In December 1849, also, Captains
                    Collinson and M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clure went out to conduct further
                    search by way of Behring Strait. The former made the most remarkable voyage on
                    record along the north coast of America, while M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Clure took his ship between the west <pb break="no"

                    pack, until he was within sight of the position attained by Parry in his first
                    voyage from Baffin’s Bay. Here M'Clure’s ship was finally iced up in the Bay of
                    God’s Mercy. On the return of Austin’s expedition, the same ships were again
                    sent out under Captains Belcher and Kellett by Baffin’s Bay; and M'Clintock,
                    Osborn, Mecham, and Hamilton, who were once more in the front rank of searchers,
                    surpassed even their former efforts. Mecham discovered a record left by M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clure on Melville Island which revealed his position,
                    and thu3 he and his officers and crew, by marching from their abandoned ship to
                    the “Resolute” and returning to England with the expedition of Belcher and
                    Kellett, were enabled to make the North-West Passage partly by ship and partly
                    sledging over the ice. They all returned in 1854. But the concluding search was
                    made by Sir Leopold M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clintock in the “Fox” from
                    1857 to 1859, when he found the record on King William Island, and thus
                    discovered the fate of Franklin. These search expeditions added immensely to our
                    knowledge of the Arctic regions, and established the true method of exploration.
                    Sea voyages in the summer season are useful for reconnaissances, but efficient
                    polar work can only be achieved by wintering at a point beyond any previously
                    reached, and sending out extended sledge parties in the spring.</p>
                <p>After the return of M*Clintock, England neglected the great work of Arctic
                    exploration for fifteen years; but a deep interest was taken in the discovery of
                    the unknown polar regions by other nations, and numerous efforts to explore them
                    were made in the interval. In 1853-55 Dr Kane, with the American brig “Advance,”
                    wintered just within the entrance of Smith Sound, and sent an exploring party
                    for some distance up the east side of the channel; and in 1860-61 Dr Hayes
                    wintered near the same spot, and made a sledge journey up the west side. Ten
                    years afterwards Captain Hall, accompanied by Dr Bessels, a German scientific
                    explorer, sailed in the “Polaris” in August 1871, and succeeded in making his
                    way up the channels leading north from Smith Sound for 250 miles, wintering in
                    81° 38' N. Captain Hall unfortunately died in the autumn of 1871, and his
                    comrades returned after suffering great hardships, The “Polaris” was abandoned,
                    but she had attained the highest latitude ever reached by any vessel up to that
                    date. In the direction of Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya the Norwegian walrus
                    hunters made many daring vovages. They circumnavigated both those masses of
                    Arctic land, and yearly frequented the hitherto closed Sea of Kara. The Swedes,
                    under the lead of the accomplished and indefatigable Nordenskiöld, have made
                    voyage after voyage to Spitzbergen, and afterwards to the north-east. The first
                    Swedish expedition to Spitzbergen was in 1857, the second in 1861, the third in
                    1864, the fourth in 1868, consisting of the steamer “Sophia,” which reached the
                    highest latitude ever attained by a vessel trying the Spitzbergen route, namely,
                    81° 42' N. In 1872 a fifth expedition started, and Nordenskiöld then passed his
                    first winter in the Arctic regions, and gained experience of sledge-travelling
                    in the spring, exploring a large area of North-East Land. Experience also proved
                    that the Spitzbergen route was not one by which large results could be secured,
                    although the scientific researches of the Swedes in Spitzbergen itself were most
                    valuable. In 1875 therefore Professor Nordenskiöld made his first attempt
                    towards the north-east, reaching the mouth of the Yenisei; andin 1876 he made’an
                    equally successful voyage in the same direction. The Germans also entered the
                    field of Arctic enterprise. In 1868 Captain Koldewey made a summer voyage to
                    Spitzbergen, and in 1869-70 he went in the “Germania” to the east coast of
                    Greenland, accompanied by Lieutenant Payer, wintered at the Pendulum Island,
                    discovered by Clavering in 1823, whence they made a sledge journey to the
                    northward as far as 77°, and explored a deep fjor l in about 73° 1 5' N. during
                    the navigable season. English yachtsmen, notably Lamont and Leigh Smith, were
                    also in the field; and the latter made important corrections of the charts of
                    NorthEast Land. But by far the most important and successful voyage in this
                    period was that of Lieutenants Weyρrecht and Payer in the Austrian steamer
                    “Tegethoff.” Sailing in 1872, they were beset in the ice to the north of Novaya
                    Zemlya during the winter of 1872-73, and were drifted northwards until, on
                    August 31, 1873, they sighted a previously unknown country. It proved to be very
                    extensive, and was named Franz Josef Land. In March 1874 Lieutenant Payer
                    started on an extended sledge journey, in the equipment of which he closely
                    followed M‘Clintock’s system. He discovered a great extent of coast-line, and
                    attained a latitude of 82° 5' N. at Cape Fligely. The Austrian explorers were
                    eventually obliged to abandon the “Tegethoff,” reaching Norway in September
                    1874; but their expedition was a great success, and they added an extensive
                    region to the map of the known world.</p>
                <p>In England the very important branch of geographical research relating to the
                    Arctic regions was neglected by the Government during this interval of fifteen
                    years, while Americans, Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, Austrians, and English
                    yachtsmen were making praiseworthy efforts with more or less success. The
                    resumption of English Arctic research on an adequate scale is due to the
                    exertions and arguments of Admiral Sherard Osborn from 1865 until 1875. He set
                    forth the valuable results to be obtained, and the means of success. Basing his
                    arguments on long experience, he showed that it was necessary for success that
                    an expedition should follow a coast-line, that it should pass beyond any point
                    previously reached and there winter, and that the work should be completed by
                    extended sledge parties in the spring. At length an expedition was fitted out on
                    these principles, the Smith Sound route was selected, and in May 1875 the
                    “Alert” and “Discovery” sailed from Portsmouth under the command of Captain
                    Nares. As regards the ice navigation the success of the expedition was complete.
                    Captain Nares, in the face of unparalleled difficulties, brought the ships to a
                    point farther north than any vessel of any nation had ever reached before,
                    wintered the “Alert” in 82 <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> 27' N., and, in the
                    face of still greater difficulties, brought both vessels safely home again. The
                    extended sledge-travelling called forth an amount of heroic devotion to duty,
                    and of resolute perseverance in spite of greater obstacles than had ever been
                    encountered before, which add a proud page to the history of English naval
                    enterprise. The exploring parties were led by Commander Markham and Lieutenants
                    Aldrich and Beaumont. Advancing over the great frozen Polar Sea, Markham reached
                    83° 20' 26" N., the highest latitude ever attained by any human being. He thus
                    won the blue ribbon of Arctic discovery. Aldrich discovered 200 miles of coast
                    to the westward, while Beaumont added to our knowledge of the north coast of
                    Greenland. The results of the Arctic expedition of 1875-76 were the creation of
                    a young generation of experienced Arctic officers, the discovery of 300 miles of
                    new coast-line and of a large section of the Polar Ocean, the attainment of the
                    highest latitude ever reached by man, a year’s magnetic and meteorological
                    observations at two stations both further north than any before taken, tidal
                    observations, the examination of the geology of a vast region and the discovery
                    of a fossil forest in 82° N., and large natural history collections representing
                    the fauna and flora of a new region.</p>
                <p>The return of this memorable expedition again incited our neighbours to further
                    efforts. In the summer of 1878 the Dutch entered the field, and the schooner
                    “William <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0210-0197"/> Barents,” under Lieutenants de Bruyne and
                    Koolemans Beynen, made a useful reconnaissance of the Barent’s Sea; while
                    Professor Nordenskiold left Sweden in July 1878, in the well-equipped steamer
                    “Vega,” to achieve the NorthEast Passage. In August he rounded Cape Chelyuskin,
                    tiιe most northern point of the Old World, and reached the mouth of the Lena.
                    But much work remains to be done in the polar regions, in order to complete the
                    connexion between Aldrich’s furthest in 1876 and MOlintock’s in 1854, to
                    complete the discovery of the north side of Greenland, to explore the northern
                    bounds of Franz Josef Land, and to discover lands north of Siberia.</p>
                <p>There is one great branch of physical geography which has only been effectively
                    studied within the last thirty years, namely, the physical geography of the sea.
                    Mathew Fontaine Maury, by his wind and current charts, by his trade wind, storm,
                    rain, and whale charts, and above all by his charming work <hi rend="italic">The
                    Physical Geography of the Sea,</hi> gave the first impulse to this study. It was
                    Captain Maury who organized the first deep-sea soundings in the North Atlantic,
                    which up to that time was deemed to be unfathomable; and when his work was
                    published, the illustrious Humboldt declared Maury to be the founder of a new
                    and important science—the meteorology of the sea. He first took charge of the
                    Washington Observatory in 1842; he resigned that post under a deep sense of duty
                    in April 1861, after a career of great usefulness; and he ended a noble and
                    well-spent life in 1872. The investigations into the physical geography of the
                    sea, which were combined into a system by Maury, have since been ably and
                    zealously continued by others, among whom the names of Dr Carpenter, SirWyville
                    Thomson, and Professor Mohn of Christiania are pre-eminent, The voyage of the
                    “Challenger” from 1873-1876, under Captains Nares and Thomson, with Sir Wyville
                    Thomson as chief of the scientific staff, was organized with the object of
                    examining and mapping the bottom of the ocean, of describing the fauna of the
                    great depths, of ascertaining the temperatures at various depths, and of solving
                    questions relating to oceanic circulation. The area thus explored in the
                    Atlantic, Antarctic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans is of vast extent, and the
                    researches, ably and zealously conducted, have resulted in an important addition
                    to geographical knowledge.</p>
                <p>In this rapid sketch of the history of geographical discovery, the labours of
                    numerous explorers during many generations have been enumerated; but its perusal
                    will show that, notwithstanding all this work, there is much remaining to be
                    done. Vast areas round both poles, and in the interior of Asia, Africa, South
                    America, aud New Guinea, are still unknown, even more extensive regions have
                    only been partially explored, and millions of square miles remain to be
                    surveyed, before the work of geographers is complete. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>All our knowledge of the planet on which we live, whether obtained from the
                    explorations of travellers, the voyages of navigators, or the discoveries of
                    astronomy in modern times, goes to confirm the doctrine held and taught by
                    philosophers in a remote antiquity that the earth is spherical. What is
                    spherical, however, is not the actual surface of the earth, but rather that of
                    the sea produced in imagination to pass through the continents. That the surface
                    of the sea is convex any one may—at a seaside station where there is a high
                    cliff—convince himself, by noting with a telescope at the top of the cliff the
                    exact appearance of a ship in, or slightly beyond, the horizon, and then,
                    immediately after, repeating at the foot of the cliff the same observation on
                    the same ship. By a more precise observation of the sea horizon from a known
                    altitude one may even calculate the radius of the earth.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> (fig. 1) be a point on the top of a mountain; <hi
                    rend="italic">hnk</hi> a portion of the earth’s surface <hi rend="italic">;
                    mηv</hi> a line drawn from <hi rend="italic">m</hi> towards the centre of the

                    >lmh, or</hi> the depression of the sea horizon, one can, knowing <hi
                    rend="italic">rnn,</hi> calculate very simply the radius of the earth. Let the
                    height <hi rend="italic">mη = h,</hi> the angle <hi rend="italic">lmh = ⅛,</hi>
                    and the radius of the earth = then since the angle subtended at the earth’s
                    centre by <hi rend="italic">lιη</hi> is δ, it is clear that (Δ + r) cosδ = r,
                    which gives <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in terms of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and δ,
                    known quantities. In fact, since <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and δ are both small,
                    <hi rend="italic">r≈μ÷</hi> sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ^δ∙ But here we
                    have assumed that the ray of light proceeding from <hi rend="italic">h</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> takes a rectilinear course; this is not true however,
                    for the path is curved, its concavity being turned towards the earth—a
                    consequence of terrestrial refraction. From the laws of terrestrial refraction,
                    which have been very minutely studied, we know that the formula last written
                    down should be <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = ’ 422Λ÷sin <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> ∣δ. Now to take an actual case—the depression of the sea horizon at the
                    top of Ben Nevis is 64' 48'' (this is the mean of several observations, taken
                    with special precautions for the express purpose of this experimental
                    calculation), and the height of the hill is 4406 feet, or ∙8345 of a mile. The
                    formula gives at once r=3965 miles, which is remarkably Dear the truth. But this
                    method is not capable of precision on account of the variableness of terrestrial
                    refraction. In connexion with the appearance of the sea horizon from a height
                    the following formulae are useful :— <hi rend="italic">h</hi> being the height
                    in feet, δ the depression or <hi rend="italic">dip</hi> of the horizon in
                    minutes, s the distance of the horizon in miles, then <hi rend="italic

                <p>Thus, for instance, to a spectator on the top of Snowdon, which is 3590 feet in
                    height, the distance of the sea horizon is about 80 miles.</p>
                <p>The first great fact in the description of the earth being that it is spherical
                    (or at any rate so nearly so that, were a perfect model of it constructed, no
                    one could, by unaided vision, discover that it is not spherical), the next
                    points to be noted are,—secondly, that the earth rotates uniformly round an axis
                    passing through its centre, and fixed, or very nearly fixed as to direction, in
                    space; and thirdly, that its figure is not spherical but spheroidal, the surface
                    being that found by the revolution of an ellipse round its minor axis, the axis
                    of figure corresponding with the axis of diurnal rotation. The spheroidal figure
                    is a necessary consequence of the rotation. The rotation of the earth once in 24
                    hours, although made evident by the rising and setting of the heavenly bodies,
                    is rendered perhaps more distinctly visible by Foucault’s pendulum experiment.
                    Let a heavy ball be suspended by a fine thread, free from tension, from a fixed
                    point. Let it be drawn aside from the position of equilibrium and then dropped
                    so that it commences to oscillate in a vertical plane passing through the point
                    of suspension. Then a careful observation of the pendulum will show that its
                    plane of oscillation is not fixed, but has a uniform rotation in a direction
                    opposite to that of the earth’s rotation. Suppose, for instance, that the
                    pendulum were suspended at the north pole and that it were set oscillating in a
                    plane passing through any one fixed star, then it will continue to oscillate in
                    that same plane notwithstanding the earth’s rotation. Consequently, to the
                    observer there the plane of the pendulum’s oscillation will appear to rotate
                    through 360° in 24 hours. At the equator, since there is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0211-0198"/> no component of rotation there, the pendulum
                    would continue to move in one and the same plane. At intermediate stations the
                    rate of rotation is easily calculated; and observations confirm the
                    calculations, and have made the earth’s rotation actually visible.</p>
                <p>The poles of the earth are the points in which the axis of rotation, or of
                    figure, meet the surface; and the equator is the circle in which the surface is
                    intersected by a plane through the earth’s centre, perpendicular to the axis of
                    rotation. Every point of the equator is therefore equidistant from the
                    poles.</p>
                <p>To determine the position of a point in space three co-ordinates or measurements
                    are necessary; they may be three lines, or two lines and one angle, or two
                    angles and oue line. Thus, to define the precise position of a point on the
                    earth’s surface, we express it by latitude, longitude, and altitude; the first
                    two are angular measures, the third a linear magnitude, namely the height above
                    the surface of the sea.</p>
                <p>The line in which the surface of the earth is intersected by a plane through the
                    axis of rotation is called a meridian, and all meridians are evidently similar
                    curves. A line perpendicular to the surface at any point is called a vertical
                    line; it corresponds with the direction of gravity there; being produced
                    outwards, that is, away from the earth’s centre it meets the heavens in the <hi
                    rend="italic">zenith</hi>; and produced downwards it intersects the axis of
                    revolution; it would of course pass through the earth’s centre were it a sphere;
                    as it is, it passes <hi rend="italic">near</hi> the earth’s centre.</p>
                <p>The angle between the meridian planes of two statione as A and B is called the
                    difference of longitude of A and B, or the longitude of B with reference to A.
                    In British maps the longitudes of all places are expressed with reference to the
                    Royal Observatory of Greenwich.</p>
                <p>The latitude of any point is the angle made by the vertical line there with the
                    plane of the equator, or the co-latitude is the angle between the vertical line
                    and the axis of rotation. The surface of the earth being one of revolution, any
                    intersecting plane parallel to the equator cuts it in a circle. If wc imagine
                    the vertical lines drawn at any two points, as P and Q, in such a circle it is
                    evident from the symmetry of the surface that these verticals make the same
                    angle with the equator; in other words, the latitudes of all points on this
                    circle are equal. Such circles are called parallels; they intersect meridians at
                    right angles.</p>
                <p>If we suppose that at any point Q of the surface the meridian, or a small bit of
                    it, is actually traced on the surface, and also a portion of the parallel
                    through the same point, then these lines, crossing at right angles in Q, mark
                    there the directions which we call north and south, east and west—the meridian
                    lying north and south, the parallel east and west. Planes containing the
                    vertical line at Q are vertical planes there. A vertical plane is defined by its
                    azimuth, which is the angle it makes with the meridian plane; the azimuth at Q
                    of any object (or point) celestial or terrestrial is the angle which the
                    vertical plane passing through the object makes with the meridian, The south
                    meridian is generally taken as the zero of azimuth. The plane touching the
                    surface at Q is the visible horizon there—a plane parallel to this through the
                    centre of the earth being called the rational horizon. The altitude at Q of a
                    heavenly body, as a star, is the angle which the line drawn from Q to the star
                    makes with the plane of the horizon,—the zenith distance of the same star being
                    the angle between its direction and the vertical at Q.</p>
                <p>By a degree of the meridian is meant this: if E, F are points on the same
                    meridian such that the directions of their verticals make with each other an
                    angle of one degree— a ninetieth part of a right angle—then the distance between
                    E and F measured along the meridian is a degree of the meridian. As the radius
                    of curvature of an ellipse is variable, increasing from the extremity of the
                    major axis to the extremity of the minor axis, so on the earth’s surface a
                    degree of the meridian is found by geodetic measurement to increase from the
                    equator to the poles.</p>
                <p>The actual length of a degree of the meridian at the equator is 362746 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 feet; at either pole it is 366479 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 feet. The length of one degree of the equatorial
                    circle is 365231∙1 feet</p>
                <p>With regard to the figure of the earth as a whole, the polar radius is 3949 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 79 miles, and the radius of the equator 3963 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3C miles; the difference of these, called the
                    ellipticity, is of the mean radius. A spheroid with these semiaxes is equivalent
                    in volume to a sphere having a radius of 3958 ’ 79 miles. Without referring
                    further here to the spheroidal figure, we shall now, having given the precise
                    dimensions, regard the earth as a sphere whose radius is 3959 miles. On such a
                    sphere one degree is 69Ό9 miles. From the definitions given above it appears
                    that the radius of the parallel which corresponds to all points whose latitude
                    is &lt;∕&gt; is 3959 cos <hi rend="italic">φ;</hi> and that one degree of this
                    circle, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one degree of longitude in the latitude <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> is 69O9cos≠ expressed in miles.</p>
                <p>In the representation of the spherical earth (fig. 2) P is the pole, QQ the
                    equator, E,F any two points on the surface, PEe, PF/the meridians of those
                    points intersecting the equator in <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and/ Join EF by a
                    great circle; then in the spherical triangle PEF the angle at P is the
                    difference of longitude of E and F, PE is the co-latitude of Έ, and PF the
                    co-latitude of F, the latitudes being eE and ∕F respectively. The angle at E,
                    being that contained between the meridian there and a vertical plane passing
                    through F, is the azimuth of F (measured in this case from the north), while the
                    angle at F is the azimuth of E. If, then, there be given the latitudes and
                    longitudes of two places, to find their distance apart, and their relative
                    bearings, it becomes necessary to calculate a spherical triangle (PEF) in which
                    two sides and the included angle are given,—the calculation bringing out the
                    third side, which is the required distance, with the adjacent azimuthal
                    angles.</p>
                <p>The latitudes and longitudes of places on the earth’s surface are determined by
                    observations of the stars, of the sun, and of the moon. As the earth rotates,
                    the zenith of any place (not being on the equator) traces out among the stars a
                    small circle having for centre that point in which the axis of rotation meets
                    the heavens. If there were a star at this last point it would be apparently
                    motionless, having always the same altitude and azimuth. The pole star, though
                    very conveniently near the north pole of the heavens, and without perceptible
                    motion to the unaided eye, is in reality moving in a very small circle. The
                    zenith of a point on the equator traces out in the heavens a great circle,
                    namely, the celestial equator.</p>
                <p>As the positions of points on the earth are defined with reference to the equator
                    and a certain fixed meridian, so the positions of stars are defined by their
                    angular distance from the celestial equator, called in this case declination,
                    and by their right ascension, which corresponds to terrestrial longitude. Stars
                    which are on the same meridian plane (extended to the heavens) have the same
                    right ascension. Right ascension is expressed in time from 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> to 24 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>. A sidereal
                    clock, going truly, indicates 24 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> for every
                    revolution of the earth: at every observatory, the sidereal clock there shows,
                    at each moment, the right ascension of the stars which at that moment are on the
                    meridian. Thus the right ascension of the zenith is the sidereal time.</p>

                    among the stars by the zenith of any given place, say Q, then the outer circle
                    encloses all those stars which are circumpolar at Q, that is, whose entire
                    course is performed above that horizon; for clearly the zenith distance of none
                    of these can exceed 90° at Q. Or if the outer circle be that described by the
                    zenith of Q, then the inner circle encloses all those stars which are
                    circumpolar at Q. The second circle in the diagram shows the diurnal paths of
                    stars with reference to the horizon.</p>
                <p>If we consider in the first circle the changes of distance between any one star
                    and the zenith of Q as the latter traces out its path in the heavens, we see
                    that the distance becomes alternately a maximum and a minimum every twelve
                    hours, namely, when the meridian of Q passes through the star. This is called
                    the star’s culmination or meridian transit. It will be clear from an inspection
                    of the figure that, if for instance the star culminate to the south of the
                    zenith, the star’s declination plus its zenith distance at culmination is equal
                    to the latitude of the zenith, that is, of Q. A corresponding rule is easily
                    made for a northern transit. Thus the simplest manner of determining the
                    latitude is to measure the zenith distance of a known star at its meridian
                    transit.</p>
                <p>The position of the zenith at any moment may be determined by simultaneous
                    observation of the zenith distance of two known stars. For these distances
                    clearly determine a point in the heavens (two points rather, which however need
                    not be confounded) whose declination and right ascension can be computed by
                    spherical trigonometry. Thus, at the same time, are obtained both the time and
                    the latitude. For the success of this method, which is suitable for travellers
                    exploring an unknown country, it is desirable that the stars should differ in
                    azimuth by about a right angle.</p>
                <p>If the path of the zenith, that is, the latitude, be known, then clearly a single
                    observation of the zenith distance of a known star, which should be towards the
                    east or west, not towards the north or south, will fix the place or right
                    ascension of the zenith, that is, the sidereal time, at the moment of
                    observation. Here the pole, the zenith, and the star are the angular points of a
                    spherical triangle, of which the three sides are known: the angle at the pole,
                    being computed,, is the difference of right ascension of the star and the
                    zenith. Thus the sidereal time is found.</p>
                <p>The determination of the difference of longitude of the two stations AB on the
                    earth’s surface requires that the true time be kept at each. All that is
                    necessary is a comparison of these times at any instant. For instance, the time
                    at B may, by the transport of chronometers, be brought to. A, and thus the
                    difference of the local times be ascertained, or the indications of the clock at
                    A may be conducted by electro-telegraphy to B. The difference of the local times
                    at A and B is the time a star takes to pass from the meridian of the one to that
                    of the other; and this is the difference of longitude which may be converted
                    into angle at the rate of 360° to 24 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>.</p>
                <p>But the traveller in unknown lands, who seeks to fix astronomically his position,
                    has no telegraph to count on and his expectations for longitude depend chiefly
                    on observations of the moon. In the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> are
                    published the angular distances of the moon from certain stars in its path for
                    every three hours of Greenwich time. Therefore, by actually observing the
                    distance of the moon from one of these stars, one can infer the corresponding
                    Greenwich time at the moment of observation. The comparison of this with the
                    local time gives the longitude.</p>
                <p>Observations on the sun have shown that it traces out amongst the stars in the
                    course of a year a great circle, inclined to the equator at an angle of 23∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi>; at midsummer it attains a maximum northern
                    declination of 23J <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, and at midwinter a maximum
                    southern declination of the same amount. Hence it is inferred that the earth
                    moves round the sun in a plane, completing one orbital revolution yearly, the
                    axis of the earth’s diurnal rotation being inclined to this plane at an angle of
                    66∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. Upon this angle of inclination depend the
                    seasons, and in great measure the climates of the different portions of the
                    earth’s surface.</p>
                <p>It is usual to draw on globes and in maps a circle or parallel at the distance of
                    23∣ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> from the equator on either side; of these
                    circles the northern is called the Tropic of Cancer, the southern is the Tropic
                    of Capricorn. A circle drawn with a radius of 23⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>
                    from the North Pole as centre is the Arctic Circle; a similar and equal circle
                    round the South Pole is the Antarctic Circle.</p>
                <p>When the sun is in the equator—which it crosses from north to south in September,
                    and from south to north in March—it is in the horizon of either pole. When the
                    sun has northern declination, the North Pole is in constant daylight and the
                    South Pole in darkness. When the sun has southern declination the North Pole on
                    the contrary is in constant darkness while the South Pole is illuminated by
                    sunshine. At midsummer in the northern hemisphere the whole region within the
                    Arctic Circle is in constant daylight, and that within the Antarctic Circle is
                    in darkness; at midwinter this state of things is exactly reversed. The portion
                    of the globe lying between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle is called
                    the North Temperate Zone; that between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic
                    Circle is the South Temperate Zone. In the former the sun is always to the south
                    of the zenith; in the latter it is always to the north.</p>
                <p>In the Torrid Zone, which lies between the Tropics, the sun, at any given place,
                    passes the meridian to the north of the zenith for part of the year, and to the
                    south for the remainder.</p>
                <p>When the sun is to the north of the equator the days are longer than the nights
                    in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere the nights are
                    longer than the days; when the sun has southern declination this condition is
                    reversed. As the sun increases his north declination from 0° to 23∣°, not only
                    do the days increase in length in the northern hemisphere, but the rays of the
                    sun—in the Temperate and Arctic regions—impinge more perpendicularly on the
                    surface; hence the warmth of summer. Even in summer the rays of the sun in the
                    Arctic regions strike the surface very obliquely; this, combined with the
                    protracted season of darkness, produces excessive cold. Summer in the northern
                    hemisphere is thus contemporaneous with winter in the southern; while winter in
                    the northern hemisphere is simultaneous with summer in the southern.</p>
                <p>The length of the day at any place at any season of the year is easily
                    ascertained from the following considerations. Let <hi rend="italic">ns

                    sun’s declination, which we suppose to be north, then the hemisphere <hi
                    rend="italic">gnaef</hi> is in sunshine, while the hemisphere <hi rend="italic"
                    >gbqsf</hi> is in darkness. As the earth rotates, a point which is at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> at midday is carried from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> towards
                    6, which it reaches at midnight; <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is reached at 6
                    o’clock p.M. and <hi rend="italic">k</hi> at sunset. Now if φ be the latitude of
                    the place and δ the sun’s declination 7d∙ = sin ≠ tan δ; this in the parallel
                    whose radius is cosφ corresponds to an angle whose sine is tanφ tanδ. Call this
                    angles; the time taken to rotate through it is <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="italic">η</hi>;
                    hence the length of the daylight is 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> + γLι∕,
                    and the length of night 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>-⅛</p>
                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">η</hi> vanishes when either <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> or δ
                    is zero; that is, at the equator the nights and days are equal in length
                    throughout the year; and again when the sun is in the equator, that is, at the
                    equinox, the nights and days are equal in all latitudes. When the sun’s
                    declination is equal to the co-latitude, <hi rend="italic">η</hi> is a right
                    angle, and the sun does not actually set; this can only happen at places within
                    the polar circle. The longest day at Gibraltar is 14 <hi rend="superscript">
                    h</hi> 27 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>, at Falmouth 16 <hi rend="superscript">

                    <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 40 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>.</p>
                <p>All this, however, is on the supposition that day ends with sunset; but the
                    length of apparent day is increased by atmospheric refraction and reflection.
                    When the disk of the setting sun first seems to touch the horizon it is in
                    reality wholly below it and is only seen by refraction. After the sun has wholly
                    set at any given place his light still continues to illuminate the upper portion
                    of the atmosphere there, so that, instead of ending abruptly, daylight gradually
                    fades away until the sun is 18° below the horizon.</p>
                <p>In a diagram (fig. 5) similar to the last draw <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> parallel

                    zenith distance is 108°. The duration of twilight corresponds then to the

                <p>At any given latitude the twilight is shortest when the great circle passing
                    through <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> passes also
                    through the sun. Expressed algebraically, if τ be the duration of the shortest
                    twilight in angular measure and δ the sun’s declination at the time, then</p>
                <p>- sin δ = sin <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> tan 9° sin ⅛ τ = sec <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> sin 9°.</p>
                <p>Suppose in the last diagram the sun to be at his greatest northern declination,
                    then <hi rend="italic">ng =</hi> 23£°, <hi rend="italic">gm</hi> = 18 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">rnq</hi> = 48∣°. Hence a place
                    whose latitude is 48j° N. has, at midsummer, twilight lasting from sunset to
                    midnight and continuing from midnight to sunrise, that is, for a few days there
                    is no absolute darkness. A little further south this twilight is interrupted by
                    a short period of darkness. Since <hi rend="italic">is =</hi> 23^° - 18° = 5£°,
                    we see from the diagram that the South Pole is at this time in total darkness,
                    which extends to all places within 5∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> of it. When
                    the sun’s declination is 9’ south, the North Pole is iu the centre of the
                    twilight belt; thus all places whose latitude is greater than 8Γ then move in
                    continual twilight, alternating between clearness and dimness, never attaining
                    either daylight or total darkness. The actual period during which either pole is
                    in total darkness is about two and a half months.</p>
                <p>At the equator, the shortest twilight occurs at the equinox, when it is l <hi

                <p>At page 205, fig. 19 is a perspective representation of the earth—of more than a
                    hemisphere, in fact—namely, the segment <hi rend="italic">mgnafi</hi> in fig. 5.
                    It exhibits all those regions of the earth which at Greenwich apparent noon at
                    midsummer are in sunshine <hi rend="italic">and</hi> twilight. It is very
                    remarkable how Asia and America, but especially the former, just escape going
                    into darkness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Construction of Maps.</hi></p>
                <p>In the construction of maps, one has to consider how a portion of spherical
                    surface, or a configuration traced on a sphere, can be represented on a plane.
                    If the area to be represented bear a very small ratio to the whole surface of
                    the sphere, the matter is easy: thus, for instance, there is no difficulty in
                    making a map of a parish, for in such cases the curvature of the surface does
                    not make itself evident. If the district is larger and reaches the size of a
                    county, as Yorkshire for instance, then the curvature begins to be sensible, and
                    one requires to consider how it is to be dealt with. The sphere not being a
                    developable surface cannot be opened out into a plane like the cone or cylinder,
                    consequently in a plane representation of configurations on a sphere it is
                    impossible to retain the desired proportions of lines or areas or equality of
                    angles. But though one cannot fulfil all the requirements of the case, we may
                    fulfil some by sacrificing others; that is to say, we may, for instance, have in
                    the representation exact similarity to all very small portions of the ( riginal,
                    but at the expense of the areas, which will be quite misrepresented. Or we may
                    retain equality of areas if we give up the idea of similarity. It is therefore
                    usual, excepting in special cases, to steer a middle course, and, by making
                    compromises, endeavour to obtain a representation which shall not offend the
                    eye.</p>
                <p>A globe gives a perfect representation of the surface of the earth; but
                    practically, the necessary limits to its size make it impossible to represent in
                    this manner the details of countries. A globe of the ordinary dimensions serves
                    scarcely any other purpose than to convey a clear conception of the earth’s
                    surface as a whole, exhibiting the figure, extent, position, and general
                    features of the continents and islands, with the intervening oceans and seas;
                    and for this purp&lt;5se it is indeed absolutely essential and cannot be
                    replaced by any kind of map.</p>
                <p>The construction of a map virtually resolves itself into the drawing of two sets
                    of lines, one set to represent meridians, the other to represent parallels.
                    These being drawn, the filling in of the outlines of countries presents no
                    difficulty. The first and most natural idea that occurs to one as to the manner
                    of drawing the circles of latitude and longitude is to draw them according to
                    the laws of <pb break="no"

                    may regard geographical maps from a more general point of view as
                    representations of the surface of the globe, for which purpose we have but to
                    draw meridians and parallels according to any given law; then any place we have
                    to fix must take that position with reference to these lines that it ha3 on the
                    sphere with reference to the circles of latitude and longitude. Let the law

                    Hence the condition that the rectangle PQRS is similar to the rectangle <hi

                    when the nature of the lines representing the circles of latitude and longitude
                    is defined we can at once calculate the error or exaggeration of scale at any
                    part of the map, whether measured in the direction of a meridian or of a
                    parallel; and also the misrepresentation of angles.</p>
                <p>The lines representing in a map the meridians and parallels on the sphere are
                    constructed either on the principles of true perspective or by artificial
                    systems of developments. The perspective drawings are indeed included as a
                    particular case of development in which, with reference to a certain point
                    selected as the centre of the portion of spherical surface to be represented,
                    all the other points are represented in their true azimuths,—the rectilinear
                    distances from the centre of the drawing being a certain function of the
                    corresponding true distances on the spherical surface. For simplicity we shall
                    first apply this method to the projection or development of parallels and
                    meridians when the pole is the centre. According to what has been said above,
                    the meridians are now straight lines diverging from the pole, dividing the 360°
                    into equal angles; and the parallels are represented by circles having the pole
                    as centre, the radius of the parallel whose co-latitude is <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> being p, a certain function of <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> The particular

                    length of its side being <hi rend="italic">i—</hi> is represented by a rectangle

                <p>If it were possible to make a perfect representation, then we should have <hi
                    rend="italic">σ -</hi> 1, σ' = 1 throughout. This, however, is impossible. We
                    may make σ== 1 throughout by taking <hi rend="italic">ρ = u.</hi> This is known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Equidistant Projection,</hi> a very simple and
                    effective method of representation.</p>
                <p>Or we may make σ ’ = 1 throughout. This gives p = sin <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> a
                    perspective projection, namely, the <hi rend="italic">Orthographic.</hi> Or we
                    may require that areas be strictly represented in the development. This will be
                    effected by making <hi rend="italic">σσ</hi> = 1, or ρc7p = sin <hi
                    rend="italic">udu,</hi> the integral of which is p = 2 sinjw, which is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Equivalent Projection</hi> of Lambert, sometimes referred to as
                    <hi rend="italic">Lorgna'</hi><hi rend="italic">s Projection.</hi> In this
                    system there is misrepresentation of form, but no misrepresentation of areas. Or
                    we may require a projection in which all small parts are to be represented in
                    their true forms. For instance, a small square on the spherical surface is to be
                    represented as a small square in the development. This condition will be
                    attained by making <hi rend="italic">&lt;r = σ',</hi> or the integral of which
                    is, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> being an arbitrary constant, p = ctan∣w. This,
                    again, is a perspective projection, namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stereographic.</hi> In this, though all small parts of the surface are
                    represented in their correct shapes, yet, the scale varying from one part of the
                    map to another, the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> is not a similar representation
                    of the original. The scale, σ = ∣c sec <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∣w, at any
                    point, applies to all directions round that point.</p>
                <p>These two last projections are, as it were, at the extremes of the scale; each,
                    perfect in its own way, is in other respects very objectionable. We may avoid
                    both extremes by the following considerations. Although we cannot make σ=1 and
                    &lt;r' = 1, so as to have a perfect picture of the spherical surface, yet
                    considering <hi rend="italic">σ</hi>- 1 and <hi rend="italic">σ</hi>- 1 as the
                    local errors of the representation, we may make (σ- 1) <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> + (σ'-1) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> a minimum over the whole surface
                    to be represented. To effect this we must multiply this expression by the
                    element of surface to which it applies, viz., <hi rend="italic">siηududp,</hi>
                    and then integrate from the centre to the (circular) limits of the map. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi> be the spherical radius of the segment to be represented,
                    then the total misrepresentation is to be taken as <hi rend="italic">J</hi> l(⅛-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>)H⅛r <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) ’ i* <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> * ’ *</p>
                <p>which is to be made a minimum. Putting <hi rend="italic">ρ = u + y,</hi> and
                    giving to <hi rend="italic">y</hi> only a variation subject to the condition δy
                    = O when w = 0, the equations of solution—using the ordinary notation of the

                <p>For simplicity of explanation we have supposed this method of development so
                    applied as to have the pole in the centre. There is, however, no necessity for
                    this, and any point on the surface of the sphere may be taken as the centre. All
                    that is necessary is to calculate by spherical trigonometry the azimuth and
                    distance, with reference to the assumed centre, of all the points of
                    intersection of meridians and parallels within the space which is to be
                    reprc-sentedin aplane. Then the azimuth is represented unaltered, and any
                    spherical distance <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi> Thus we get all the points of intersection transferred to the
                    representation, and it remains merely to draw continuous lines through these
                    points, which lines will be the meridians and parallels in the
                    representation.</p>
                <p>The exaggeration in such systems, it is important to remember, whether of linear
                    scale, area, or angle, is the same for a given distance from the centre,
                    whatever be the azimuth; that is, the exaggeration is a function of the distance
                    from the centre only.</p>
                <p>We shall now examine and exemplify some of the most important systems of
                    projection and development, commencing with <hi rend="italic">Perspective
                    Projections.</hi></p>
                <p>In perspective drawings of the sphere, the plane on which the representation is
                    actually made may generally be any plane perpendicular to the line joining the
                    centre of the sphere and the point of vision. If V be the point of vision, P any
                    point on the spherical surface, then <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the point in
                    which the straight line VP intersects the plane of the representation, is the
                    projection of P.</p>
                <p>In the orthographic projection, the point of vision is at an infinite distance
                    and the rays consequently parallel; in this case the plane of the drawing may be
                    supposed to pass through the centre of the sphere. Let the circle (fig. 8)
                    represent the plane of the equator on which we propose to make an orthographic
                    representation of meridians and parallels. The centre of this circle is clearly
                    the projection of the pole, and the parallels are projected into circles having
                    the pole for a common centre. The diameters <hi rend="italic">aa', bb'</hi>
                    being at right angles, let the semicircle <hi rend="italic">bob'</hi> be divided
                    into the required number of equal parts; the diameters drawn through these
                    points are the projections of meridians. The distances of c, of <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> from the diameter <hi
                    rend="italic">aa</hi> are the radii of the successive circles representing the
                    parallels. It is clear that, when the points of division are very close, the
                    parallels will be very much crowded towards the outside of the map; so much so,
                    that this projection is not much used.</p>
                <p>For an orthographic projection of the globe on a meridian plane, let <hi
                    rend="italic">qnrs</hi> (fig. 9) be the meridian, <hi rend="italic">ns</hi> the
                    axis of rotation, then <hi rend="italic">qr</hi> is the'projection of the
                    equator. The parallels will be represented by straight lines passing through the
                    points of equal division; these lines are, like the equator, perpendicular to
                    <hi rend="italic">ns.</hi> The meridians will in this case be ellipses described
                    on <hi rend="italic">ns</hi> as a common major axis, the distances of <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> from <hi rend="italic">ns</hi> being the minor semiaxes.</p>
                <p>Let us next construct an orthographic projection of the sphere on the horizon of
                    any place. Set off the angle <hi rend="italic">aop</hi> (fig. 10) from the
                    radius <hi rend="italic">oa,</hi> equal to the latitude. Drop the perpendicular
                    <hi rend="italic">pP</hi> on <hi rend="italic">oa,</hi> then P is the projection
                    of the pole. On <hi rend="italic">ao</hi> produced take oδ = ∕&gt;P, then <hi
                    rend="italic">ob</hi> is the minor semiaxis of the ellipse representing the
                    equator,.its major axis being <hi rend="italic">qr</hi> at right angles to <hi
                    rend="italic">ao.</hi> The points in which the meridians meet this elliptic
                    equator are determined by lines drawn parallel to <hi rend="italic">αob</hi>
                    through the points of equal subdivision <hi rend="italic">cdefgh.</hi> Take two
                    points, as <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which are 90°
                    apart, and let <hi rend="italic">ik</hi> be their projections on the equator;
                    then <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is the pole of the meridian which passes through
                    <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> This meridian is of course an ellipse, and is
                    described with reference to <hi rend="italic">i</hi> exactly as the equator was
                    described with reference to P. Produce <hi rend="italic">io</hi> to Z, and make
                    <hi rend="italic">lo</hi> equal to half the shortest chord that can be drawn
                    through <hi rend="italic">i</hi>; then <hi rend="italic">lo</hi> is the semiaxis
                    of the elliptic meridian, and the major axis is the diameter perpendicular to
                    <hi rend="italic">iol.</hi></p>
                <p>For the parallels: let it be required to describe the parallel whose co-latitude
                    is <hi rend="italic">u</hi>; take <hi rend="italic">pm =pη = u,</hi> and let <hi
                    rend="italic">m'n</hi> be the projections of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and
                    iionoPa; thenτn'√is the minor axis of the ellipse representing the parallel. Its
                    centre is of course midway between <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">n',</hi> and the greater axis is equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn.</hi> Thus the construction is obvious. When <hi rend="italic">pm</hi> is
                    less than <hi rend="italic">pa,</hi> the whole of the ellipse <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0216-0203"/> is to be drawn. When <hi rend="italic">pm</hi> is
                    greater than <hi rend="italic">pa,</hi> the ellipse touches the circle in two
                    points; these points divide the ellipse into two parts, one of which, being on
                    the other side of the meridian plane <hi rend="italic">aqr,</hi> is
                    invisible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stereographic Projection.—</hi> In this case the point of
                    vision is on the surface, and the projection is made on the plane of the great
                    circle whose pole is V. Let <hi rend="italic">kplN</hi> (fig. 12) be a great
                    circle through the point of vision, and <hi rend="italic">ors</hi> the trace of
                    the plane of projection. Let <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the centre of a small
                    circle whose radius is <hi rend="italic">cp = d;</hi> the straight line <hi
                    rend="italic">pl</hi> represents this small circle in orthographic
                    projection»</p>
                <p>We have first to show that the stereographic projection of the small circle <hi
                    rend="italic">pl</hi> is itself a circle; that is to say, a straight line
                    through V, moving along the circumference of <hi rend="italic">pl,</hi> traces a
                    circle on the plane of projection <hi rend="italic">ors.</hi> This line
                    generates an oblique cone standing on a circular base, its axis being eV (since
                    the angle <hi rend="italic">ρNc =</hi> angle cVZ); this cone is divided
                    symmetrically by the plane of the great circle <hi rend="italic">kpl,</hi> and
                    also by the plane which passes through the axis Vc, perpendicular to the plane
                    <hi rend="italic">kpl.</hi> Now Vr∙Vp, being <hi rend="italic">=
                    'VosecLVp∙</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">kcοsLVp</hi> = Vo∙V⅛,
                    is equal toVs·VZ; therefore the triangles <hi rend="italic">Vrs, Nlp</hi> are
                    similar, and it follows that the section of the cone by the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">rs</hi> is similar to the section by the plane <hi rend="italic"
                    >ph</hi> But the latter is a circle, hence also the projection is a circle; and
                    since the representation of every infinitely small circle on the surface is
                    itself a circle, it follows that in this projection the representation of small
                    parts is (as we have before shown) strictly similar. Another inference is that
                    the angle in which two lines on the sphere intersect is represented by the same
                    angle in the projection. This may otherwise be proved by means of fig. 13, where
                    <hi rend="italic">Nok</hi> is the diameter of the sphere passing through the
                    point of vision, <hi rend="italic">fgh</hi> the plane of projection, <hi
                    rend="italic">kt</hi> a great circle, passing of course through V, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ouυ</hi> the line of intersection of these two planes. A tangent
                    plane to the surface at <hi rend="italic">t</hi> cuts the plane of projection in
                    the line <hi rend="italic">rvs</hi> perpendioular to <hi rend="italic">ov∙,
                    tv</hi> is a tangent to the circle <hi rend="italic">kt</hi> at <hi
                    rend="italic">t, tr</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ts</hi> are any two tangents to
                    the surface at <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Now the angle <hi rend="italic">vtu
                    (u</hi> being the projection of i)is90°- <hi rend="italic">otV</hi> = 90° - <hi
                    rend="italic">oVt = ouV = tuv,</hi> therefore <hi rend="italic">tv</hi> is equal
                    to <hi rend="italic">uv</hi>; and since <hi rend="italic">tvs</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">uvs</hi> are right angles, it follows that the angles <hi
                    rend="italic">vts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vus</hi> are equal. Hence the angle
                    <hi rend="italic">rts</hi> also is equal to its projection <hi rend="italic"
                    >rus∙,</hi> that is, any angle formed by two intersecting lines on the surface
                    is truly represented in the stereographic projection.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the projection of any circle of the sphere is itself a circle.
                    But in the case in which the circle to be projected passes through V, the
                    projection becomes, for a great circle, a line through the centre of the sphere;
                    otherwise, a line anywhere. It follows that meridians and parallels are
                    represented in a projection on the horizon of any place by two systems of
                    orthogonally cutting circles, one system passing through two fixed points,
                    namely, the poles; and the projected meridians as they pass through the poles
                    show the proper differences of longitude.</p>
                <p>To construct a stereographic projection of the sphere on the horizon of a given
                    place. Draw the circle <hi rend="italic">vlkr</hi> (fig. 14) with the diameters
                    <hi rend="italic">kv, lr</hi> at right angles; the latter is to represent the
                    central meridian. Take <hi rend="italic">koP</hi> equal to the co-latitude of
                    the given place, say <hi rend="italic">u∙.</hi> draw the diameter PoP', and vP,
                    √P' cutting <hi rend="italic">lr</hi> in <hi rend="italic">pp</hi><hi

                    projections of the poles, through which all the circles representing meridians
                    have to pass, All their centres then will be in a line <hi rend="italic"
                    >smn</hi> which crosses <hi rend="italic">pp'</hi> at right angles through its
                    middle point <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Now to describe the meridian whose west

                    >p</hi> will make an angle ojoy = ωwith <hi rend="italic">pp</hi><hi

                <p>Again, for the parallels, take Pδ = Pc equal to the co-latitude, say c, of the

                    >ed</hi> is the diameter of the circle which is the required projection; its

                <p>The line <hi rend="italic">sn</hi> itself is the projection of a parallel,

                <p>A very interesting connexion, noted by Professor Cayley, exists between the

                <p>The conical development is adapted to the construction of maps of tracts of
                    country of no great extent in latitude <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0219-0206"/> but any extent in the direction of a parallel.
                    Selecting the mean parallel, or that which most nearly divides the area to be
                    represented, we have to consider the cone which touches the sphere along that
                    parallel. In fig. 20, which is an orthographic projection of the sphere on a
                    meridian plane, let <hi rend="italic">Vp</hi> be the parallel of contact with
                    the cone. ON being the axis of revolution, the tangents at P and <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ</hi> will intersect ON produced in V. Let Qy be a parallel to
                    the north of P∕&gt;, R?· another parallel the same distance to the south, that
                    is, PQ = PR. Take on the tangent PV two points H, K such that PH = PK, each
                    being made equal to the arc PQ. It is clear, then, that the surface generated by
                    HK is very nearly coincident with the surface generated by RQ when the figure
                    rotates round ON through any angle, great or small. The approximation of the
                    surfaces will, however, be very close only if QR is very small. Suppose, now,
                    that the paths of H and K, as described in the revolution round ON, are actually
                    marked on the surface of the cone, as well as the line of contact with the
                    sphere. And further, mark the surface of the cone by the intersections with it
                    of the meridian planes through OV at the required equal intervals. Then let the
                    cone be cut along a generating line and opened out into a plane, and we shall
                    have a representation as in fig. 21 of the spherical surface contained between
                    the latitudes of Q and</p>
                <p>R. The parallels here are represented by concentric circles, the meridians by
                    lines drawn through the common centre of the circles at equal angular intervals.
                    Taking the radius of the sphere as unity, and <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> being the
                    latitude of P, we see that VP = cot &lt;≠&gt;, and if ω be the difference of
                    longitude between two meridians, the corresponding length of the arc Pp is ω cos
                    <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> The angle between these meridians themselves is ω sin
                    <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose, now, we require to construct a map on this principle for a tract of
                    country extending from latitude <hi rend="italic">φ - m</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">φ + m,</hi> and covering a breadth of longitude of <hi
                    rend="italic">2n, m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being expressed in
                    degrees. In fig. 21 let HKH be the quadrilateral formed by the extreme lines, so
                    that HK = ΛAi = 2nι; then the angle HV/t is 2nsinφ expressed in degrees. Now,
                    taking the length of a degree as the unit, VP = 57 ’ 296 cot <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ,</hi> and VH = 57 ’ 296 cot <hi rend="italic">φ - rn.</hi> It maybe
                    convenient in the first instance to calculate the chords HÄ, K⅛, and thus
                    construct the rectilinear quadrilateral HKUι. The lengths of these chords are
                    <hi rend="italic">Hh=</hi> 2(57 ’ 296 cot <hi rend="italic">φ-rn)</hi> sin <hi
                    rend="italic">(η</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">φ), KB=2(57'296</hi> cot <hi
                    rend="italic">φ + m)</hi> sin (nsin≠), and the distance between them is <hi
                    rend="italic">2m</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">(n</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ).</hi> The inclined sides of this trapezoid will then meet in a point at V,
                    whose distance from P and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> must correspond with the
                    calculated length of VP. Now with this centre V describe the circular arcs
                    representing the parallels through H, K, P. Also if the parallels are to be
                    drawn at every degree of latitude, divide HK into <hi rend="italic">2m</hi>
                    equal parts, and through each point of division describe a circular arc from the
                    centre V. Then divide <hi rend="italic">T</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">p</hi> into
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">2λ</hi> equal parts, and draw the meridian lines through
                    each of these points of division and the centre V.</p>
                <p>If the centre V be inconveniently far off, it may be necessary to construct the
                    centre parallel by points, that is, by calculating the coordinates of the
                    variouβ points of division. For this purpose, draw through the intersection of
                    the centre meridian and centre parallel a line perpendicular to the meridian and
                    therefore touching the parallel. Let the coordinate <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be
                    measured from the centre along this line, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    perpendicular to it. Then the coordinates of a point whose longitude measured
                    from the centre meridian is ω are</p>
                <p>«= cot <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">(ω</hi> sin <hi
                    rend="italic">φ),</hi> y = 2cot <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ⅛(ωsin ≠)=a&gt;tan ⅛(ωsin <hi rend="italic">φ),</hi>
                    the radius of the sphere being the unit; if a degree be the unit, these must be
                    multiplied by 57 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 296.</p>
                <p>The great defect of this projection is the exaggeration of the lengths of
                    parallels towards either the northern or southern limits of the map. Various
                    have been the devices to remedy this defect, and amongst these the following is
                    a system very much adopted. Having subdivided the central meridian and drawn
                    through the points of division the parallels precisely as described above, then
                    the true lengths of degrees are set off along <hi rend="italic">each</hi>
                    parallel; the meridians, which in this case become curved lines, are drawn
                    through the corresponding points of the parallels (fig. 22).</p>
                <p>This system is that which was adopted in 1803 by the “Dépôt de la Guerre” for the
                    map of France, and is there known by the title “<hi rend="italic">Projection de
                    Bonne.”</hi> It is that on which the Ordnance Survey map of Scotland on the
                    scale of one inch to a mile is constructed, and it is frequently met with in
                    ordinary atlases. It is ill-adapted for countries having great extent in
                    longitude, as the intersections of the meridians and parallels become very
                    oblique—as will be seen on examining the map of Asia in most atlases. If <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> α</hi> be taken as the latitude
                    of the centre parallel, and co-ordinates be measured from the intersection of
                    this parallel with the central meridian, as in the case of the conical
                    projection, then, if <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> be the radius of the parallel of
                    latitude <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = cot <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> o</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    φ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> o</hi><hi rend="italic">- φ.</hi> Also, if S
                    be a point on this parallel whose co-ordinates are <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi>
                    so that VS = <hi rend="italic">ρ,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the angle
                    VS makes with the central meridian, then <hi rend="italic">pθ =</hi> ω cos <hi
                    rend="italic">φ;</hi> and</p>
                <p>^=psinθ, <hi rend="italic">y=cotφ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">- pcosθ.</hi></p>
                <p>Now, if we form the differential coefficients of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> with respect to <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and ω, the
                    latitude and longitude of S, we get <hi rend="italic">m'n - mn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">=coa φ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mn + m</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">n</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">= -</hi> cos <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> (cos <hi rend="italic">φ - p</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ);</hi><hi rend="italic">P</hi> the first of which equations proves that the
                    areas are truly represented. Moreover, if 90° ÷ <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> be the
                    angles of intersections of meridians and parallels, tan ψ <hi rend="italic">= θ
                    - ω</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> which indeed might have been more easily
                    obtained. In the case of Asia, the middle latitude <hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> o</hi> = 40°, and the extreme northern latitude is 70°.
                    Also the map extends 90° of longitude from the central meridian; hence, at the
                    northwest and north-east corners of the map the angles of intersection of
                    meridians and parallels are 90° ÷33° ∙54'. But for comparatively small tracts of
                    country, as France or Scotland, this projection is very suitable.</p>
                <p>Another modification of the conical projection consists in taking, not a tangent
                    cone, but a cone which, having its vertex in the axis of revolution produced,

                    midway between the centre parallel of the country and the extreme parallels. By
                    this means part of the error is thrown on the centre parallel which is no longer
                    represented by its true length, but is made too small, while the parallels

                    Gerard Mercator, who in 1554 made a map of Europeon this principle, selecting
                    for the parallels of intersection those of 40° and 60°. The same system was
                    adopted in 1745 by Delisle for the construction of a map of Russia. Euler in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Acta Acad. Imp. Petrop.,</hi> 1778, has discussed this
                    projection and determined the conditions under which the errors at the northern
                    extremity, at the centre, and at the southern extremity of a map so constructed
                    shall be severally equal. Let <hi rend="italic">c, d</hi> be the co-latitudes of
                    the extreme northern and southern parallels, γ, γ' those of two intermediate
                    parallels, which are to be truly represented in the projection. Let OC', Om'
                    (fig. 23) be two consecutive meridians, as represented in the developed cone;
                    the difference of longitude being ω, let the angle at O be Λω. The degrees along
                    the’meridian being represented by their proper lengths, CC' =≈ c' - c; and P
                    corresponding to the pole, let</p>
                <p>OP = <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> then OC <hi rend="italic">= z + c;</hi> and so for
                    G, G', C'. The true lengths of <hi rend="italic">G'n'</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gn,</hi> namely, ωsinγ' and ωsinγ, are equal to the represented lengths,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">hω(z + γ')</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hω (z</hi> + γ)
                    respectively, whence γ and γ' are known when <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> are known. Comparing now the represented with the true
                    lengths of parallel at the extremities and at the centre, if e be the common
                    error that is to be allowed, then e = 7i&lt;a(s+c) - ω sin c, e= -Λω(z+⅜c + ⅜c
                    ’) +w sin ⅛(c + c'), e=Λw(z4-c')-ω sin c'.</p>
                <p>The difference of the first and third gives A, and then subtracting the second
                    from the mean of the first and third, we get a+⅜(c+c ’)=i(c'- c) cot ⅛(c ’-c)
                    tan ⅜(c <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> + c).</p>
                <p>Thus <hi rend="italic">z</hi> being known, the common centre of the circles
                    representing the parallels is given. The value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is
                    given by the equation Λ(c' - c) = sin c' - sin c, and γ and γ' can be easily
                    computed. But there is no necessity for doing this as we may construct the
                    angles at O, which representing a difference of longitude ω are in reality equal
                    to Λω.</p>
                <p>For instance, to construct a map of Asia on this system, having divided the
                    central meridian into equal spaces for degrees, <hi rend="italic">z</hi> must be
                    calculated. Here we have c = 20°, c' = 80°, whence <hi rend="italic">z</hi> +
                    50° = 15° tan 50° cot 15° = 66° ∙7. Hence in this case the centre of the circles
                    is 16° *7 beyond the north pole; also <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 6138, so that a difference of longitude of 5° is
                    represented at 0 by an angle of 3° 4' 9". The degrees of longitude in the
                    parallel of 70° are in this map represented too large in the ratio of 1-150:1;
                    those in the mid-latitude of 40° are too small in the ratio of 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 933 :1; and those in 10° latitude are too large in
                    the ratio of 1Ό5 to 1.</p>

                    of the conical system of development. Meridians are represented by lines drawn
                    through a point, and a difference of longitude ω is represented by an angle Λω,
                    as in the preceding case. The parallels of latitude are circular arcs, all
                    having as centre the point of divergence of the meridian lines, and the law of
                    their formation is such that the representations of all small parts of the
                    surface shall be precisely similar to the parts so represented. Let <hi

                    northern and southern limits’are Dll6 and 1Ό96 respectively. The radii of the
                    parallels are these—</p>
                <p>70° . . . 32'801 30°. . . 72∙328</p>

                <p>Having drawn a line representing the central meridian, and selected a point on it
                    as the centre of the concentric circles, let arcs be described with the above
                    radii as parallels. For meridians, in this system a difference of longitude of
                    10° is represented by an angle of two-thirds that amount, or 6° 40'. The chord
                    of this angle on the parallel of 10°, whose radius is 92 ’ 801, is easily found
                    to be 10 ’ 792. Now stepping this quantity with a pair of compasses along the
                    parallel, we have merely to draw lines through each of the points so found and
                    the common centre of circles. The points of division of the parallel may be
                    checked by taking the chord of 20°, or rather of 13° 20', <pb break="no"

                    The map of North Ameιica so found (fig. 25) shows small portions of country in
                    strictly correct forms; but the areas are slightly too great at the extreme
                    latitudes and too small in the centre. At any part of the map a degree of
                    latitude may be used as the true scale in any direction.</p>
                <p>The value 7t = ⅜, as suggested by Sir John Herschel, is admirably suited for a
                    map of the world. The representation is fan-shaped, with remarkably little
                    distortion (fig. 26).</p>
                <p>It follows from what has been said above that the condition that the scale is
                    true at the equator is <hi rend="italic">hk</hi> = α, which determines <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> when <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is given. The radiu3 of the
                    parallel whose co-latitude is <hi rend="italic">u</hi> being <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be the distance of that parallel from the
                    equator; then, keeping to the condition that the scale is true at the equator,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> p</hi> = ≈ <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> a, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ^i,</p>
                <p>When <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is very small, the angles between the meridian
                    lines in the representation are very small; and proceeding to the limit, when
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is zero the meridians are parallel, that is, the vertex
                    of the cone has removed to infinity. And at the limit when <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> is zero we have <hi rend="italic">r=a</hi> log« cot ∣ , which is the
                    characteristic equation of <hi rend="italic">Hercator</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s
                    Projection.</hi></p>
                <p>From the manner in which we have arrived at this projection it is clear that it
                    retains the characteristic property of Gauss’s projection,—namely, similarity of
                    representation of small parts of the surface. In Mercator’s chart the equator is
                    represented by a straight line, which is crossed at right angles by a system of
                    parallel and equidistant straight lines representing the meridians. The
                    parallels are straight lines parallel to the equator, and the distance of the
                    parallel of latitude &lt;∕&gt; from the equator is, as we have seen above, r = α
                    log <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> tan (45° + ∣φ). In the vicinity of the equator,
                    or indeed within 30° of latitude of the equator, the representation is very
                    accurate, but as we proceed northwards or southwards the exaggeration of area
                    becomes larger, and eventually excessive,—the poles being at infinity. This
                    distance of the parallels may be expressed in the form r = α(sin≠ + ⅜ sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> φ + ⅜ sin <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> φ+ . . . .),
                    showing that near the equator <hi rend="italic">r</hi> 13 nearly proportional to
                    the latitude. As a consequence of the similar representation of small parts, a
                    curve drawn on the sphere cutting all meridians at the same angle—the loxodromic
                    curve—is projected into a straight line, and it is this property which renders
                    Mercator’s chart so valuable to seamen. For instance: join by a straight line on
                    the chart Land’s End and Bermuda, and measure the angle of intersection of this
                    line with the meridian. We get thus the bearing which a ship has to retain
                    during its course between these ports. This is not great-circle sailing, and the
                    ship so navigated does not take the shortest path. The projection of a great
                    circle (being neither a meridian nor the equator) is a curve which cannot be
                    represented by a simple algebraic equation.</p>
                <p>If we apply Mercator’s system of projection <hi rend="italic">along a
                    meridian,</hi> as proposed by Lambert, we have the representation of all
                    possible great circles. The diagram (fig. 27) gives the projection. The two
                    vertical bounding lines are the equator—crossed at right angles by the initial
                    meridian passing through one of the poles. From the form of the representations
                    of parallels round the pole it is clear that the distortion up to a distance of
                    30° or 40° from the initial meridian is not at all great. The representation
                    extends to infinity upwards and downwards, and the left and right halves are
                    interchangeable; if interchanged the representation is on a meridian extending
                    from pole to pole.</p>
                <p>The meridian Mercator drawn as described in the last paragraph—with the meridians
                    and parallels rather close—</p>

                    ordinary Mercator’s chart the track of a great circle joining any two places,
                    and of indicating at the same time the distance of the two places. For this
                    purpose the two charts must be on the same scale, one of them being on tracing
                    paper or tracing linen. The transparent chart being placed over the other, the
                    equator in the ordinary chart must coincide with the initial meridian in the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Polyconic Development.</hi></p>
                <p>Imagine a hollow globe formed of a mere surface of paper, to be cut by a system
                    of parallel planes along equidistant parallels of latitude; let also one
                    meridian be cut through, from north pole to south pole, 180°. In this state let
                    the whole be opened out into a plane from the meridian exactly opposite to the
                    one cut through, and the previously spherical surface is converted into a number
                    of strips of paper, each of which is part of a circular belt, with the exception
                    of the equator, which will be straight. All points which lay on the parallel
                    whose co-latitude is <hi rend="italic">u</hi> now lie on an arc of a circle
                    whose radius is tanti and length 2πsinw∫ moreover, the centres of these arcs lie
                    in the same straight line, which is the central meridian produced. The parallels
                    being now defined, we must define meridians. These may be formed by laying off
                    on each parallel the degrees of longitude according to their true lengths, which
                    is the system adopted in the maps of the United States Coast Survey. Or we may
                    take for meridians that system of lines which cuts the parallels at right
                    angles, forming the rectangular polyconic system.</p>
                <p>In this case, let P (fig. 28) be the north pole, CPU the central meridian, U, U'

                    a meridian curve cutting the parallels at right angles. Join CQ, C'Q'; these
                    being perpendicular to the circles will be tangents to the curve. Let UCQ =

                    equator at the distance 2« from the central meridian, then we have the following
                    very simple construction (due to Mr O’Farrell of the Ordnance Survey Office).
                    Let P (fig.</p>
                <p>29) be the pole, U any point in the central meridian, QUQ' the represented
                    parallel whose radius CU = tanw. Draw SUS' peιpendicular to the meridian through
                    U; then to determine the point Q, whose longitude is, say, 3°, lay off US equal
                    to half the true length of the arc of parallel on the sphere, t.e., l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> 30' to radius sin <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> and with
                    the centre S and radius SU describe a circular arc, which will intersect the
                    parallel in the required point Q. For if we suppose 2ω to be the longitude of
                    the required point Q, US is by construction <hi rend="italic">= ω</hi> sin <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> and the angle subtended by SU at C is tan^ <hi

                    advantages of this method are that with a remarkably simple and convenient mode
                    of construction we have a map in which the parallels and meridians intersect at
                    right angles.</p>

                <p>with regard to the distortion involved in this system of development, consider a

                    the northern latitudes, say along the parallel of 70°, the representation is
                    much cramped.</p>
                <p>With regard to the distortion in the map of Africa as thus constructed, consider
                    a small square in latitude 40° and in 40° longitude east or west of the central
                    meridian, the square being so placed as to be transformed into a rectangle. The
                    sides, originally unity, become 0 ’ 95 and 1*13, and the area l ’ 08, the
                    diagonals intersecting at90° ± 9° 56'. In the perspective projection a square of
                    unit side occupying the same position, when transformed to a rectangle, has its
                    sides U02 and 145, its area 147, and its diagonals intersect at 90° ÷ 7° 6'. The
                    latter projection is therefore the best in point of “similarity,” but the former
                    represents areas best. This applies, however, only to a particular part of the
                    map; along the equator towards 30° or 40° longitude, the polyconic is certainly
                    inferior, while along the meridian it is better than the perspective—except, of
                    course, near the centre. Upon the whole, the more even distribution of
                    distortion gives the advantage to the perspective system. The system of lines
                    ordinarily used for the map of Africa is objectionable, and has scarcely the
                    excuse of facility of construction, since the perspective coordinates given
                    above are so easily computed.</p>

                <p>The method of development used in the Ordnance Survey maps of England on the

                    and Ireland, on the 6-inch scale is this. A central meridian having been

                    ground but its slope. Fig. 31 sh0w3 a piece of contoured country, including two

                    lines having a common tangent there. At the col, where the indicatrix is an

                <p>This term in its ordinary acceptation means a description of the physical
                    features of the earth. It includes an account of the phenomena of the atmosphere
                    <hi rend="italic">; of</hi> the composition, distribution, and movements of the
                    sea <hi rend="italic">; of</hi> the forms of the land, with its water

                    distribution of plant and animal life. Its object, however, is not to present a
                    mere bald enumeration of facts, but to group the facts together in such a way as
                    to bring before the mind a luminous picture of the whole structure and working
                    of the earth as a habitable planet. Physical geography is not so much a science
                    or branch of science as a collection of the data ascertained, and probable
                    conclusions arrived at, by different sciences, in so far as these bear upon its
                    own subject. Accordingly, it culls from all departments of inquiry whatever
                    helps to give additional distinctness and vividness to that broad conception of
                    the daily economy of the globe which it is its aim to form and develop.</p>
                <p>So vast a subject, if treated in its entirety, would demand a very large
                    allotment of space for its adequate discussion. Some of its branches have,
                    during the last few years, received so much development that in the present
                    edition of this work it has been considered more expedient to make them the
                    subject of special articles; and here, therefore, to avoid the repetition which
                    a general article on physical geography would involve, there will be given,
                    instead of a formal essay, a mere outline or synopsis of the branches of
                    knowledge embraced in the subject, with references to the other parts of the

                    parts of the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> a large section of what
                    is usually included under physical geography will be found.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Earth in its.Cosmical Delations.—</hi> F rom astronomy
                    we learn the shape and size of the earth, its motions of rotation round its axis
                    and of revolution in an elliptical orbit round the sun, the origin of day and
                    night, and of the seasons. Speculating on the original condition of the whole
                    solar system, we may regard it as having been in the condition of a nebula,
                    gradually contracting, condensing, and leaving behind successive rings, which on
                    disruption and reaggregation formed planets. Hence the primitive condition of
                    our globe as a separate mass must have been gaseous or fluid. Since that time
                    the earth has been cooling and contracting, but still retains a high residual
                    temperature in its interior. This original condition, and-the internal heat of
                    the earth, must be constantly kept in view as an explanation of many of the
                    features of its outer surface. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> part i.;
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> chapter i.; <hi rend="smallcaps">Geography
                    (Mathematical); Geodesy.</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Atmosphere or Gaseous Envelope of the Earth.—</hi> The
                    solid planet is covered by two envelopes, one of gas which completely surrounds
                    it, and one of water, which occupies about three-fourths of its surface. In
                    studying the atmosphere we have to consider its height, its composition, its
                    temperature, its moisture, and its pressure (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Atmosphere, Meteorology).</hi> Its height must be at least 40 or 50 miles. This
                    deep gaseous ocean consists of a mixture of the two gases, oxygen (21 parts by
                    weight) and nitrogen (79 parts), with a minute proportion of carbonic acid (Ό04)
                    and of aqueous vapour. The physical geographer takes note of the manifold
                    importance of oxygen, not only in supporting animal life, but in the general
                    oxidation of the earth’s outer crust. He recognizes the atmospheric carbonic
                    acid as the source of the carbon built up into the structure of plants. He
                    cannot contemplate without ever-increasing wonder and delight the coming and
                    going of the water-vapour in the air, as it rises incessantly from every sea and
                    land, and after condensation into visible form courses over the land as rain,
                    brooks, rivers, and glaciers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> part iii.
                    ). The consideration of the temperature of the atmosphere elicits the facts that
                    temperature falls as we rise above the sea-level, and as we recede from the
                    equator to the poles, and that it is profoundly affected by the relative
                    positions of sea and land. The want of strict dependence upon latitude in this
                    distribution of temperature is strikingly brought out by the contrast between
                    the mean temperature of Labrador and Ireland on the same parallels (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Climate, Isotherms).</hi> In dealing with the moisture of the
                    air we have to consider the phenomena of evaporation and condensation, the
                    formation of dew, clouds, rain, snow, and hail, the distribution of rain, the
                    position of the snow-line, the occurrence of deserts, &amp;c. (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology).</hi> The study of the. pressure of the
                    atmosphere, which appears to vary with variations in temperature and amount of
                    vapour, brings before us the cause of the constant aerial movements. The law has
                    now been well established that air always flows out from tracts where the
                    barometric pressure is high into those where it is low. A knowledge of the
                    distribution of pressure over the globe furnishes the key to the great movements
                    of the atmospheric circulation. The trade winds, for example, blow constantly
                    from a belt of high pressure towards the equator, where the pressure remains
                    low. Periodic winds, like the monsoons and land and sea breezes, shift with the
                    changes in atmospheric pressure. Thus Asia during winter is a vast region of
                    high pressure; the winds round its margin therefore flow out towards the sea. In
                    summer, on the other hand, it becomes a region of low pressure, and the winds
                    consequently blow inland from the sea. Sudden and violent atmospheric movements,
                    such as tempests and hurricanes, are illustrations of the same law, the force of
                    the wind being always proportional to the shortness of the space between great
                    extremes of pressure (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Atmosphere).</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Ocean or Water-Envelope of the Earth,</hi> from the
                    point of view of physical geography, presents for considera tion the form of the
                    basins in which it is contained, the shape and nature of their bottom, their
                    submarine ridges and islands, the density and composition of the water, the
                    distribution of marine temperature, the ice of the sea, and the movements of the
                    ocean due to cosmical causes as in the tides, to the effects of winds as in
                    surface drifts, currents, and waves, and to differences of temperature. The
                    largest additions in recent years to our knowledge of the earth have been made
                    in the ocean, notably by the different expeditions and cruises equipped for the
                    purpose by the British Government. The climates of the sea have been
                    systematically determined, and the extraordinary fact has been brought to light
                    that the great mass of the ocean water is cold, or below 40° Fahr. Even in the
                    equatorial parts of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Atlantic</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pacific Oceans</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(ç.v.),</hi> though the
                    upper layers of water partake in the heat of the intertropical latitudes, a
                    temperature of 40° is found within 300 fathoms of the surface, while at the
                    bottom, at depths of 2500 or 3000 fathoms, the temperature (32 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 4 to 33° Fahr.) is very little above that of the
                    freezing-point of fresh water. It has been proved that the bottom temperature of
                    every ocean in free communication with the poles has a temperature little
                    different from that of the water in polar latitudes. Between Scotland and the
                    Faroe Islands a sounding was obtained giving even a temperature of 29 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 6, or 2 ’ 4 degrees below the freezing-point of
                    fresh water, and very little above that of salt water. These observations
                    warrant the conclusion that a vast system of circulation takes place in the
                    ocean. The cold heavy polar water creeps slowly towards the equator under the
                    upper lighter water, which moves away towards the poles.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Land.—</hi> We have to consider the distribution of the
                    land over the face of the globe, the grouping of the continents, the forms and
                    trend of the great terrestrial ridges, the relation of coast-line to superficial
                    area, the contours of the land, as mountains, table-lands, valleys, and plains,
                    the relation of the continents to each other as regards general mass (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> part ii.; <hi rend="smallcaps">Africa, America,
                    Asia, Europe).</hi> Over this framework of land there is a ceaseless circulation
                    of water. The vapour raised by the sun’s heat from every ocean and surface of
                    water on the land, after being condensed into clouds and rain, falls in large
                    measure upon the land, and courses over its surface from mountain to shore in
                    brooks and rivers, which again have their own distinguishing phenomena, such as
                    the formation of terraces, deltas, &amp;c. Part of the water performs an
                    underground circulation and returns to the surface in springs. Another portion
                    falls as snow upon the mountains and descends into valleys in the form of
                    glaciers. In this ceaseless flow of water from the summits to the sea we must
                    recognize one of the great agencies by which the present contour of the land has
                    been moulded (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> part iii., section
                    ii.).</p>
                <p>The physical geographer collects, moreover, data which show the reaction of the
                    earth’s interior upon its surface,— proofs from bores and mines of a progressive
                    increase of temperature downwards, the evidence of hot springs, and of
                    earthquakes and volcanoes. He finds proofs of oscillations in the level of the
                    land, some regions having been raised and others depressed within the times of
                    human history. From the geologist he learns that such instability has
                    characterized the outer crust of the planet from very ancient times, and that
                    indeed it is to the results of terrestrial movements that we owe the existence
                    of mountain ranges and even the dry land itself (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Geology,</hi> part iii., <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n225/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0225-0212"/> section i., and part vii.). He perceives that the
                    present area of land on the earth’s surface is the result of the balance of two
                    antagonistic processes—the destruction caused by superficial agents on every
                    portion of land exposed to their influence, and the periodic elevation, by
                    subterranean action, of the land so wasted, or of new land from beneath the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Distribution of Animal and Vegetable Life.—</hi> It is usual
                    to include in treatises on physical geography an outline of the distribution of
                    plants and animals, with an account of the great regions or provinces into which
                    zoologists and botanists have divided the continents. The question naturally
                    arises why the distribution should be as it is. Two answers obviously suggest
                    themselves—1st, climate, and 2d, the power possessed by plants and animals of
                    diffusing themselves. Yet climate only explains a part of this problem, and it
                    is evident that migration cannot possibly account for the diffusion of
                    innumerable organisms. There is a large residuum of unexplained phenomena on
                    which much light is thrown by geological inquiry. Thus, for example, the
                    presence of living Arctic forms of vegetation on the mountains of central Europe
                    can be connected with the occurrence of the remains of Arctic animals in the
                    superficial deposits of that region, and with other facts which make it clear
                    that at no very distant date an Arctic climate prevailed over most of Europe,
                    that at that time a northern vegetation spread southwards and covered the plains
                    and heights of Europe even as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and that as

                    temperature, but continued to maintain its ground amid the congenial frosts and
                    snows of the mountains, where to this day it still flourishes (see <hi
