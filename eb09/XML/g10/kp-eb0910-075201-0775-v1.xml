                <p><label type="entry">GOLDBEATING</label>. The art of goldbeating is of great
                    antiquity, being referred to by Horner; and Pliny states that one ounce of gold
                    was extended to 750 leaves, each leaf being four fingers square, which is three
                    times the thickness of the ordinary leaf gold of the present time. In all
                    probability the art originated among Oriental communities, where the working of
                    gold and the use of gold ornaments have been distinguishing characteristics from
                    the most remote periods; and in India goldbeating is still carried on as a craft
                    involving many mysteries and great difficulties. On the coffins of the Theban
                    mummies specimens of original leaf-gilding are met with, where the gold is in so
                    thin a state that it resembles modern gilding. The Incas of Peru do not appear
                    to have been able to reduce gold further than to plates which could be nailed
                    for ornamentation on the walls of their temples. In England goldbeating was
                    confined to London until within the present century. It was introduced into
                    Scotland and the United States within that period, and it is now practised in
                    most towns of any considerable size; but so far as concerns Great Britain it is
                    principally centred in London. One grain of gold has been beaten out to the
                    extent of 75 square inches, and the same weight of silver to 98 square inches.
                    Taking a cubic inch of gold at 4900 grains, this gold-leaf is the 367,650th part
                    of an inch in thickness, or about 1200 times thinner than ordinary printing
                    paper. The silver, though spread over a larger surface, was thicker, owing to
                    the difference in its specific gravity; but, calculated by weight, silver is the
                    most malleable metal with which we are acquainted, in that respect considerably
                    exceeding gold. This experiment does not, however, determine the extent of the

                    degree of tenuity to which the gold is reduced is not nearly so great as the
                    example above quoted. A “book of gold” containing 25 leaves measuring each 3∣
                    inches, equal to an area of 264 square inches, generally weighs from 4 to 5
                    grains.</p>
                <p>The gold used by the goldbeater is variously alloyed, according to the variety of
                    colour required. Fine gold is commonly supposed to be incapable of being reduced
                    to thin leaves. This, however, is not the case, although its use for ordinary
                    purposes is undesirable on account of its greater cost. It also adheres on one
                    part of a leaf touching another, thus causing a waste of labour by the leaves
                    being spoiled; but for work exposed to the weather it is much preferable, as it
                    is more durable, and does not tarnish or change colour. The external gilding on
                    many public buildings, such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as the Albert Memorial
                    in Hyde Park, London, is done with pure gold. The following is a list of the
                    principal classes of leaf recognized and ordinarily prepared by British beaters,
                    with the proportions of alloy per ounce they contain.</p>

                <p>The process of goldbeating is thus conducted. The gold, having been alloyed
                    according to the colour desired, is melted in a crucible, at a higher
                    temperature than is simply necessary to fuse it, as its malleability is improved
                    by exposure to a greater heat; sudden cooling does not interfere with its
                    malleable properties, gold differing in this respect from some other metals. It
                    is then cast into an ingot, and flattened, by rolling between a pair of powerful
                    smooth steel rollers, into a ribbon of 1⅛ inch wide and 10 feet in length to the
                    ounce. After being flattened it is annealed and cut into pieces of about 6⅜ grs.
                    each, or about 75 per ounce, and placed between the leaves of a “cutch,” which
                    is about half an inch thick and 3⅛ inches square, containing about 180 leaves of
                    a tough paper manufactured in France. Formerly fine vellum was used for this
                    purpose, and generally still it is interleaved in the proportion of about one of
                    vellum to six of paper. The cutch is beaten on for about 20 minutes with a
                    17-pound hammer, which rebounds by the elasticity of the skin, and saves the
                    labour of lifting, by which the gold is spread to the size of the cutch; each
                    leaf is then taken out, and cut into four pieces, and put between the skins of a
                    “shoder,” 4⅛ inches square and ∣ths of an inch thick, containing about 720
                    skins, which have been worn out in the finishing or “mould” process. The shoder
                    requires about two hours’ beating upon with a 9-pound hammer. As the gold will
                    spread unequally, the shoder is beaten upon after the larger leaves have reached
                    the edges. The effect of this is that the margins of larger leaves come out of
                    the edges in a state of dust. This allows time for the smaller leaves to reach
                    the full size of the shoder, thus producing a general evenness of size in the
                    leaves. Each leaf is again cut into four pieces, and placed between the leaves
                    of a “mould,” composed of about 950 of the finest gold-beaters’ skins, five
                    inches square and three-quarters of an inch thick, the contents of one shoder
                    filling three moulds. The material has now reached the last and most difficult
                    stage of the process; and on the fineness of the skin and judgment of the
                    workman the perfection and thinness of the leaf of gold depend. During the first
                    hour the hammer is allowed to fall principally upon the centre of the mould.
                    This causes gaping cracks upon the edges of the leaves, the sides of which
                    readily coalesce and unite without leaving any trace of the union after being
                    beaten upon. At the second hour, when the gold is about the 150,000th part of an
                    inch in thickness, it for the first time permits the transmission of the rays of
                    light. In pure gold, or gold but slightly alloyed, the green rays are
                    transmitted; and in gold highly alloyed with silver, the pale violet rays pass.
                    The mould requires in all about four hours’ beating with a 7-pound hammer, when
                    the ordinary thinness for the gold leaf of commerce will be reached. A single
                    ounce of gold will at this stage be extended to 75×4× 4 = 1200 leaves, which
                    will trim to squares of about 3∣ inches each. The finished leaf is then taken
                    out of the mould, and the rough edges are trimmed off by slips of the ratan
                    fixed in parallel grooves of an instrument called a waggon, the leaf being laid
                    upon a leathern cushion for that purpose. The sizes to which British leaf .is
                    cut are 3, 3⅛, 3∣, 3g, and 3⅛ inches. The leaves thus prepared are placed into
                    “books” capable of holding 25 leaves each, which have been nibbed over with red
                    ochre to prevent the gold clinging to the paper. The leaf is used for gilding
                    picture frames, and for other ornamental purposes. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Gilding.</hi></p>
                <p>The fine membrane called goldbeaters’ skin, used for making up the shoder and
                    mould, is the outer coat of the caecum or blind gut of the ox. It is stripped
                    off in lengths about 25 or 30 inches, and freed from fat by dipping in a potash
                    solution and scraping with a blunt knife. It is afterwards stretched on a frame;
                    two membranes are glued together, treated with a solution of aromatic substances
                    or camphor in isinglass, and subsequently coated with white of egg. Finally they
                    are cut into squares of 5 or 5^ inches; and to make up a mould of 950 pieces the
                    gut of about 380 oxen is required, about 2∣ skins being got from each animal. A
                    skin will endure about 200 beatings in the mould, after which it is fit for use
                    in the shoder alone.</p>
                <p>The dryness of the cutch, shoder, and mould is a matter of extreme delicacy. They
                    require to be hot-pressed every time they are used, although they may be used
                    daily, to remove the moisture which they acquire from the atmosphere, except in
                    extremely frosty weather, when they acquire so little moisture that then a
                    difficulty arises from their over-dryness, whereby the brilliancy of the gold is
                    diminished, and it spreads very slowly under the hammer. On the contrary, if the
                    cutch or shoder be damp, the gold will become that which is technically termed
                    hollow or sieve-like; that is, it is pierced with innumerable microscopical
                    holes; and in the moulds in its more attenuated state it will become reduced to
                    a pulverulent state. This condition is more readily produced in alloyed golds
                    than in fine gold. It is necessary that each skin of the mould should be rubbed
                    over with calcined gypsum (the fibrinated variety) each time the mould may be
                    used, in order to prevent the adhesion of the gold to the surface of the skin in
                    beating. Dentist gold is gold leaf carried no further than the cutch stage, and
                    should be perfectly pure gold.</p>
                <p>By the above process also silver is beaten, but not so thin, the inferior value
                    of the metal not rendering it commercially desirable to bestow so much labour
                    upon it. Copper, tin, zinc, palladium, lead, cadmium, platinum, and aluminium
                    can be beaten into thin leaves, but not to the same extent as gold or
                    silver.</p>
