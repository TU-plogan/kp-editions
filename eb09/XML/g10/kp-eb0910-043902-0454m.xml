                    exogenous plants, which is taken by botanists as the type of the natural order
                    <hi rend="italic">Geraniaceae.</hi> The name, as a scientific appellation, has a
                    much more restricted application than when taken in its popular sense. Formerly
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Geranium</hi> was almost conterminous with the order
                    <hi rend="italic">Geraniaceae,</hi> which latter had then a more limited meaning
                    than is given to it by those of our leading botanists of the present day who
                    include in it the <hi rend="italic">Tropaeolaceae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"

                    >Balsaminaceae.</hi> Then as now the geranium was very popular as a garden
                    plant, and the species included in the original genus became widely known under
                    that name, which has more or less clung to them ever since, in spite of
                    scientific changes which have removed the larger number of them to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelargonium.</hi> This result has been probably brought about in
                    some degree by an error of the nurserymen, who seem in many cases to have acted
                    on the conclusion that the group commonly known as <hi rend="italic">Scarlet
                    Geraniums</hi> were really geraniums and not pelargoniums, and have in
                    consequence inserted them under the former name in their trade catalogues. In
                    fact it may be said that, from a popular point of view, the pelargoniums of the
                    botanist are better known as geraniums than are the geraniums themselves.</p>
                <p>The species of <hi rend="italic">Geranium</hi> bear the English name of
                    Cranesbill, and consist mostly of herbs, of annual or perennial duration,
                    dispersed throughout the temperate regions of the world. They number nearly a
                    hundred, and bear a considerable family resemblance. The leaves are for the most
                    part palmately-lobed, and the flowers are regular, consisting of five sepals,
                    five imbricating petals, alternating with five glandules at their base, ten
                    stamens, and a beaked ovary. Some dozen or more species are natives of the
                    British Isles; and many of those of exotic origin form handsome border plants in
                    our gardens of hardy perennials. Amongst these <hi rend="italic">G. ibericum, G.
                    platypetalum,</hi><hi rend="italic">G. sanguineum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >G.</hi><hi rend="italic">Backhousianum,</hi> and the double-flowered varieties
                    of <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">pratense</hi> are conspicuous. The
                    genus is not without its virtues, <hi rend="italic">G. maculatum</hi> being the
                    alum-root of North America, used there as an astringent in diarrhoea, dysentery,
                    and such like complaints, while the native Herb Robert of English hedgesides,
                    <hi rend="italic">G. Robertianum,</hi> which is both astringent and aromatic, is
                    used as a remedy in nephritic disorders.</p>
                <p>From these regular-flowered herbs, with which they had been mixed up by the
                    earlier botanists, L’Heritier in 1787 separated those plants which have since
                    borne the name of <hi rend="italic">Pelargonium,</hi> and which, though agreeing
                    with them in certain points of structure, differ in others which are admitted to
                    be of generic value. One obvious distinction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelargonium</hi> is that the flowers are irregular, the two petals which stand
                    uppermost being different—larger, smaller, or differently marked—from the other
                    three, which latter are occasionally wanting. This difference of irregularity
                    the modern florist has done very much to annul, for the increased size given to
                    the flowers by high breeding has usually been accompanied by the enlargement of
                    the smaller petals, so that a very near approach to regularity has been in some
                    cases attained. Another well-marked difference however remains in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelargonium:</hi> the back or dorsal sepal is furnished with a
                    hollow spur, which spur is adnate, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> joined for its
                    whole length with the flower-stalk; while in <hi rend="italic">Geranium</hi>
                    there is no spur. This peculiarity is best seen by cutting clean through the
                    flower-stalk just behind the flower, when in <hi rend="italic">Pelargonium</hi>
                    there will be seen the hollow tube of the spur, which in the case of <hi
                    rend="italic">Geranium</hi> will not be found as it does not exist, but the
                    stalk will appear as a solid mass. There are other characters which support
                    those already pointed out, such as the absence of the glandules, and the
                    declination of the stamens; but the features already described offer the most
                    ready and obvious distinctions.</p>
                <p>To recapitulate, the geraniums properly so-called are regular-flowered herbs with
                    the flower stalks solid, while many geraniums falsely so-called in popular
                    language are really pelargoniums, and may be distinguished by their irregular
                    flowers and hollow flower stalks. In a great majority of cases too, the
                    pelargoniums so commonly met with in greenhouses and summer parterres are of
                    shrubby or sub-shrubby habit.</p>
