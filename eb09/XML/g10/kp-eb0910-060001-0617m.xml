                    about for a time with a company of strolling players. After a very checkered
                    experience he returned to London, and was admitted a student in the Royal
                    Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable
                    number of caricatures under fictitious names. Hogarth’s works were the delight
                    and study of his early years. Paddy on Horseback, which appeared in 1779, is the
                    first caricature which is certainly his. Two caricatures on Rodney’s naval
                    victory, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his
                    political sketches. The name of Gillray’s publisher and printseller, Miss
                    Humphrey— whose shop was first at 227 Strand, then in New Bond Street, then in
                    Old Bond Street, and finally in St James’s Street—is inextricably associated
                    with that of the caricaturist. Gillray lived with Miss (often called Mrs)
                    Humphrey during all the period of his fame. It is believed that he several times
                    thought of marrying her, and that on one occasion the pair were on their way to
                    the church, when Gillray said :—“This is a foolish affair, methinks, Miss
                    Humphrey. We live very comfortably together; we had better let well alone.”
                    There is no evidence, however, to support the stories which scandalmongers have
                    invented about their relations. Gillray’s plates were exposed in Humphrey’s shop
                    window, where eager crowds examined them. A number of his most trenchant satires
                    are directed against George HL, who, after examining some of Gillray’s sketches,
                    said, with characteristic ignorance and blindness to merit·, “I don’t understand
                    these caricatures.” Gillray revenged himself for this utterance by his splendid
                    caricature entitled A Connoisseur '«Examining a Cooper, which he is doing by
                    means of a candle on a “save-all”; so that the sketch satirizes at once the
                    king’s pretensions to knowledge of art and his miserly habits.</p>
                <p>The excesses of the French Revolution made Gillray conservative; and he issued
                    caricature after caricature ridiculing the French and Napoleon, and glorifying
                    John Bull. He is not, however, to be thought of as a keen political adherent of
                    either the Whig or the Tory party; he dealt his blows pretty freely all round.
                    His last work, from a design by Bunbury, is entitled Interior of a Barber’s Shop
                    in Aseize Time, and is dated 1811. While he was engaged on it, he became mad,
                    although he had occasional intervals of sanity, which he employed on his last
                    work. The approach of madness must have been hastened by his intemperate habits.
                    Gillray died on the 1st of June 1815, and was buried in St James’s churchyard,
                    Piccadilly.</p>
                <p>The times in which Gillray Jived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a
                    great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and
                    not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both
                    sides. Gillray’s incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of
                    resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him
                    the first place among caricaturists. He is honourably distinguished in the
                    history of caricature by the fact that his sketches are real works of art. The
                    ideas embodied in some of them are sublime and poetically magnificent in their
                    intensity of meaning; while the coarseness by which others are disfigured is to
                    be explained by the general freedom of treatment common in all intellectual
                    departments in the eighteenth century. The historical value of Gillray’s work
                    has been recognized by accurate students of history, As has been well remarked:
                    “Lord Stanhope has turned Gillray to account as a veracious reporter of
                    speeches, as well as a suggestive illustrator of events.” His contemporary
                    political influence is boπie witness to in a letter from Lord Bateman, dated
                    November 3, 1798. “The Opposition,” he writes to Gillray, “are as low as we can
                    wish them. You have been of infinite service in lowering them, and making them
                    ridiculous.” Gillray’s extraordinary industry may be inferred from the fact that
                    nearly 1000 caricatures have been attributed to him; while some consider him the
                    author of 1600 or 1700. He is invaluable to the student of English manners as
                    well as to the political student. He attacks the social follies of the time with
                    scathing satire; and nothing escapes his notice, not even a trifling change of
                    fashion in dress. The great tact Gillray displays in hitting on the ludicrous
                    side of any subject is only equalled by the exquisite finish of his sketches—the
                    finest of which reach an epic grandeur and Miltonic sublimity of conception.</p>
                <p>Gillray’s caricatures are divided into two classes, the political series and the
                    social. The political caricatures form really the best history extant of the
                    latter part of the reign of George III. They were circulated not only over
                    Britain but throughout Europe, and exerted a powerful influence. In this series,
                    George III., the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Fox, Pitt, Burke, and Napoleon are
                    the most prominent figures. In 1788 appeared two fine caricatures by Gillray.
                    Blood on Thunder fording the Red Sea represents Lord Thurlow carrying Warren
                    Hastings through a sea of gore: Hastings looks very comfortable, and is carrying
                    two large bags of money. Market-Day pictures the ministerialists of the time as
                    horned cattle for sale. Among Gillray’s best satires on the king are—Farmer
                    George and his Wife, two companion plates, in one of which the king is toasting
                    muffins for breakfast, and in the other the queen is frying sprats; The
                    Anti-Saccharites, where the royal pair propose to dispense with sugar, to the
                    great horror of the family; A Connoisseur Examining a Cooper; Temperance
                    enjoying a Frugal Meal; Royal Affability; A Lesson in Apple Dumplings; and The
                    Pigs Possessed. Among his other political caricatures may be mentioned—Britannia
                    between Scylla and Charybdis, a picture in which Pitt, so often Gillray’s butt,
                    figures in a favourable light; The Bridal Night; The Apotheosis of Hoche, which
                    concentrates the excesses of the French Revolution in one view; The Nursery with
                    Britannia reposing in Peace; The First Kiss these Ten Years (1803), another
                    satire on the peace, which is said to have greatly amused Napoleon; The
                    Handwriting upon the Wall; The Confederated Coalition, a fling at the coalition
                    which superseded the Addington Ministry; Uncorking Old Sherry; The Plum-Pudding
                    in Danger; Making Decent, i.e., Broad-bottomites getting into the Grand Costume;
                    Comforts of a Bed of Roses; View of the Hustings in Covent Garden; Phaethon
                    Alarmed; and Pandora opening her Box. The miscellaneous series of caricatures,
                    although they have scarcely the historical importance of the political series,
                    are more readily intelligible, and are even more amusing. Among the finest
                    are—Shakespeare Sacrificed; Flemish Characters (two plates); Twopenny Whist; Oh!
                    that this too solid flesh would melt; Sandwich Carrots; The Gout; Comfort to the
                    Coms; Begone Dull Care; The Cow-Pock, which gives humorous expression to the
                    popular dread of vaccination; Dilletanti Theatricals; and Harmony before
                    Matrimony and Matrimonial Harmonics —two exceedingly good sketches in violent
                    contrast to each other.</p>
                <p>A selection of Gillray’s works appeared in parts in 1818; but the first good
                    edition was Thomas M‘Lean’s, which was published with a key, in 1830. A somewhat
                    bitter attack, not only on Gillray’s character, but even on his genius, appeared
                    in the Athenaeum for October 1, 1831, which was successfully refuted by J.
                    Landseer in the Athenaeum a fortnight later. In 1851 Henry G. Bohn put out an
                    edition, from the original plates, in a handsome folio, the coarser sketches
                    being published in a separate volume. For this edition Thomas Wright and R. H.
                    Evans wrote a valuable commentary, which is a ^ood history of the times embraced
                    by the caricatures. The next edition, entitled The Works of Janies Gillray, the
                    Caricaturist: with the Story of his Life and Times <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0618-0601"/> (Chatto and Windus, 1874), was the work of Thomas
                    Wright, and, by its popular exposition and narrative, introduced Gillray to a
                    very large circle formerly ignorant of him. This edition, which is complete in
                    one volume, contains two portraits of Gillray, and upwards of 400 illustrations.
                    Mr J. J. Cartwright, in a letter to the Academy (Feb. 28, 1874), drew attention
                    to the existence of a MS. volume, in the British Museum, containing letters to
                    and from Gillray, and other illustrative documents. The extracts he gave were
                    used in a valuable article in the Quarterly Review for April 1874. See also the
                    Academy for Feb. 21 and May 16, 1874.</p>

                    Bryan's Dictionary of Painters. There is a good account of him in w∏ght's
                    History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art, 186-5. See also the
