                    <hi rend="italic">Gevennf),</hi> a city and canton of Switzerland,—the canton
                    being, with one exception, the smallest, and the city, without exception, the
                    largest within the limits of the confederation.</p>
                <p>The canton of Geneva has an area of 279 ’ 4 square kilometres, or 107 ’ 8 square
                    miles, considerably less than that of Rutland, the smallest of the English
                    counties, and this includes 11⅛ square miles of water-surface belonging to the
                    lake. The greater part of its frontier is conterminous with France, the
                    department of Haute-Savoie lying to the south, and that of Ain to the west and
                    north; while it is connected with the Swiss canton of Vaud (Waadt) along a line
                    of not more than 3∣ miles. The area belongs to the basin of the Rhone, which
                    flows for about 4 miles through the canton, and then for nearly 2 miles forms
                    the boundary towards France. With the exception of the Arve, the Rhone
                    tributaries are mere mountain streams, of which the largest is the London in the
                    extreme west. Market gardens, orchards, and vineyards occupy a large proportion
                    of the soil, whose apparent fertility, however, is due not so much to its
                    natural qualities as to the noble industry of the cultivators. Besides building
                    materials such as sandstone, slate, &amp;c., the only mineral to be 'found
                    within the canton is bituminous shale, the products of which can be used for
                    petroleum and asphalte (see <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Genève,</hi> Paris, 1877). While Geneva is, as has been stated, almost the
                    smallest of the Swiss cantons, the size of the city makes the density of its
                    population far greater than that of any other. In 1870 it had, inclusive of
                    strangers, 93,239 inhabitants, or 871 to the square mile; and this had increased
                    by 1876 to 99,352 inhabitants, or 921 to the square mile. At the earlier date,
                    43,639 were Protestants and 47,868 Roman Catholics,—the remaining fraction
                    comprising 961 Jews, and 771 of various Christian sects. The prevailing language
                    is French; but <pb break="no"

                    households, is on the increase.</p>
                <p>The city of Geneva is situated at the south-western extremity of the beautiful
                    lake of the same name, whence the noble current of the Rhone flows westward
                    under the five bridges by which the two halves of the town communicate with each
                    other. To the south lies the valley of the Arve, which unites with that of the
                    Rhone a little distance further down; and behind the Arve the grey and barren
                    rocks of the Lesser Salève rise like a wall, which in turn is overtopped by the
                    distant and ethereal snows of Mont Blanc. To the north-west the eye takes in the
                    long line of the Jura, with a pleasant stretch of country between it and the
                    lake. The actual site of the town, apart from</p>
                <p>In the strict sense of the words, Geneva is not a city of great buildings. It
                    possesses, indeed, a great many edifices, both public and private, which may
                    fittingly be described as handsome, elegant, or even beautiful, but it has
                    almost nothing to which the memory reverts as to a masterpiece of architectural
                    art. Being a favourite resort for wealthy foreigners from many lands, it has
                    been enriched with a countless variety of hotels and villas, many of which are
                    palatial in their dimensions, their construction, and their environment, and its
                    principal institutions have been installed in buildings not unworthy of a modern
                    capital; but none of these things compensate for the absence of the grander and
                    more characteristic legacies of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The
                    artistic blight of that Calvinism which was too sternly enamoured with the
                    beauty of holi-</p>
                <p>the river and the lake, is not so picturesque as that of many other places in
                    Switzerland. Though the central plateau, crowned as it is by the cathedral,
                    gives a certain relief to the general view from the water, a large proportion of
                    the town is built on the alluvial flats along the river. But what Geneva lacks
                    in picturesqueness it now makes up in an appearance of prosperity and
                    comfort,—presenting finequays, well-ordered pleasure grounds, good streets, and
                    substantial houses, and, in the number and extent of its modern suburbs, giving
                    evidence that its prosperity is not a thing of the past. Since the demolition of
                    the fortifications in 1848, it has pushed eastward to Eaux Vives, and westward
                    into Plainpalais, and an almost continuous succession of houses links it on the
                    south with the village of Carouge beyond the Arve.</p>
                <p>ness to be mindful of any other beauty has left indelible effects on the central
                    city of the creed; though it is probable that all the blame does not lie at the
                    door of Calvinism, which certainly did not find in the Genevese a people whose
                    aesthetic faculties had been too strongly developed in the previous periods of
                    their history. The cathedral itself is a second-rate building; and though, as Mr
                    Freeman remarks, “it is an excellent specimen of a small cathedral whose style
                    and plan are peculiarly its own, and which has undergone only very few
                    alterations,” its main interest is moral and historical. According to a
                    tradition, at least as likely to be true as false, it occupies the site of a
                    temple of Apollo; and the present building is the third church of St Peter which
                    has been erected on the spot. As a foundation the cathedral is said to date from
                    the middle of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0159-0148"/> the 10th century; but (even apart from documents
                    still extant which relate to the works) the transition from the Romauesque to
                    the Gothic style is sufficient evidence that it belongs architecturally to the
                    12th and the 13th. The most glaring alteration to which it has been subjected is
                    the substitution for the original façade (1749-1756) of a portico with
                    Corinthian pillars, copied after the Pantheon at Rome, which, while effective
                    and simple enough in itself, is altogether out of keeping with the rest of the
                    design. In its general plan the church is a Latin cross, having a width of about
                    65 feet and a length of 187. It is lighted by 86 windows,—those of the choir
                    still preserving painted glass of the 15th century, and some of the others being
                    filled with modern work in commemoration of the jubilee of 1835. Of the internal
                    decorations, the little that has been left comprises portions of the carved
                    stalls, and a few sepulchral monuments—most of them removed from their original
                    sites—Agrippa d’Aubigné’s, Michel Roset’s, Theodore de Beza’s, the duke and
                    duchess of Rohan’s, &amp;c. Among the older secular buildings in Geneva are the
                    Hôtel de Ville, the court-house, and the arsenal. The first, which is popularly
                    called the Maison de Ville, or Town House, is situated to the west of St
                    Peter’s. It is first mentioned in 1448, but most of the structure dates from the
                    16th and 17th centuries. There is nothing remarkable, except their plainness,
                    about the several halls or chambers—the hall of the lost footsteps, the chamber
                    of the great council, &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">Salle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des</hi><hi rend="italic">Festins</hi> is now known as the Alabama Chamber, in
                    memory of the arbitration decided within its walls in 1872. To the historian the
                    building is interesting, not only for its associations, but for the magnificent
                    scries of archives which it contains. It was in front of the house that the
                    works of Rousseau were publicly burned in 1762. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouv.</hi><hi rend="italic">Descr. du Hotel de Ville,</hi> 1877.) The
                    court-house was formerly a hospital, and has been appropriated to its present
                    purpose only since 1858. As a building it dates from 1709, and is a good
                    specimen of the Mansard style in vogue at the time. Among the structures of
                    modern date the most noteworthy are the academic or university buildings, the
                    Athénée, the Rath museum, the conservatori urn, the electoral palace, the new
                    theatre, the hall of the reformation, and the Russian church. The first .stone
                    of the academic buildings was laid i¼ 1868. They consist of three blocks forming
                    three sides of a square, and occupy an excellent position near the botanic
                    gardens in the Promenade of the Bastions. The Athénée, a highly ornamental
                    building, λvas founded for the accommodation of the old society of the arts by
                    the wealthy Genevese, J. G. Eynard (1775-1863), well known for his generous
                    devotion to the cause of Greek independence. It was in 1824 and 1826 that, in
                    accordance with his wishes, the sisters of the deceased Simon Rath (1766-1819),
                    a general in the Russian service, devoted a large part of their fortune to the
                    erection of the museum which preserves the name of the family. The building is
                    in the Greek style, with a Corinthian portico and a flight of steps, and it
                    contains a collection of copies of the cardinal masterpieces of ancient art and
                    valuable works of the modern Swis3 school The conservatorium, whose foundation
                    was due to Bartholony, a Genevese financier, owes its reputation as a musical
                    school to Bovy Lysberg (1821-1873). The Fol museum, famous for its Greek and
                    Etruscan vases, occupies the old Academy buildings in the Grand’ Rue.</p>
                <p>Among the larger benevolent institutions are the civic hospital, with an
                    endowment of 3⅛ million francs, a lunatic asylum, a deaf and dumb institute, and
                    an orphanage; and upwards of 200 distinct societies for philanthropic purposes
                    are at work in the state.</p>
                <p>From a comparatively early date the Genevese have given considerable attention to
                    education. Ini 429 François Versonnex endowed and restored the “great school,”
                    which continued to flourish till the Reformation, and was attended by numerous
                    foreign pupils. An academy and college were established by Calvin and Beza in
                    1558, anCt soon became famous. Since 1875 the academy has ranked as a
                    university, having five faculties,—a scientific, a literary, a legal, a
                    theological, and a medical. Though medical teaching was long practised in Geneva
                    by its more eminent physicians, according as circumstances suggested, there was
                    no regular provision for this department till 1874, when a staff of 13
                    professors and 10 privat-docents was instituted. An anatomical theatre has been
                    erected by the cantonal hospital, and a maternity hospital <hi rend="italic"
                    >αηά</hi><hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi><hi rend="italic">policlinique</hi> or
                    dispensary are supported by the property of the suppressed religious
                    corporations. In the winter session of 1876-7 the university had 142 regularly
                    enrolled students and 182 unattached auditors; and in the summer session the
                    students numbered 155 and the auditors 147. Of the 297 regular students, no
                    fewer than 126 were foreigners, and only 106 were Genevese proper, while among
                    the auditors the proportion of foreigners was still greater, or 187 as compared
                    with 95. The canton of Geneva has no normal school, but there are two colleges
                    (one in the town and one at Carouge), a gymnasium, and a high school for girls,
                    and in those institutions the training of teachers is an object of attention.
                    The Genevese college had 1134 pupils in 1876-7,—309 being foreigners, and of
                    these 139 French. In all the primary schools, with the exception of those of
                    Carouge, Plainpalais, and Eaux Vives, the mixed system is in vogue. Nearly all
                    the communes, from Laney in 1848 to Plainpalais in 1877, have been provided with
                    educational libraries, the total number of the books in 1867 being upwards of
                    20,000. The “public library,” formerly located in the Rue Ardaine and now in the
                    university buildings, is an admirable institution, thoroughly deserving the
                    title of public, as its books, without any needless formality, are at the
                    service of even the casual reader. The first nucleus of the collection, which
                    now numbers about 75,000 volumes, was Bonivard ’ s bequest in 1568.</p>
                <p>As early as the 14th century, Geneva was the seat of a flourishing silk trade,
                    and its woollen fabrics were largely exported. Four times a year the streets of
                    the town were filled with the traffic of its fairs, which were visited by the
                    merchants of Venice, Florence, and Genoa, of France and German Switzerland. In
                    the 16th century hats, ribbons, velvets, woollens, and gold and silver plate,
                    were among the principal products of Genevese industry; the guild of armourers
                    or <hi rend="italic">heαumicrs</hi> was a powerful corporation; and watchmaking
                    was already carried to a high degree of perfection, under the influence of
                    Charles Cusin, who had settled in the town in 1587. By 1685 there were 100
                    master watchmakers with 300 workmen, and 80 master jewellers with 200 workmen.
                    In the 17th eentuιy the silk trade made great progress, and towards its close
                    calico-printing was introduced by the Fazy family. During the 18th century the
                    number of wealthy immigrants from Italy gave an impetus to the various
                    architectural industries, but at the same time the political troubles tended to
                    scatter the industrial population. Voltaire introduced a number of Genevese
                    watchmakers to Ferney; the French sought to make Versoix a manufacturing centre;
                    and the Government of Savoy established a royal watch factory at Carouge. Since
                    the restoration of Genevese independence in 1813 the principal industries of the
                    city and canton have steadily developed. According to the census of 1860, there
                    were 515 master watchmakers and jewellers in the canton, and the number of
                    workers in the trade was 4876, of whom 4004 were men and 872 women. As early as
                    1827, about 240 persons were employed in the manufacture of musical boxes, and
                    this number had by 1873 increased to at least 1080 of both sexes, capable of
                    turning out 13,000 boxes in a year. Among the minor industries are wood and
                    ivory carving, the making of tools and scientific instruments, iron-smelting and
                    engineering, and the manufacture of tobacco, soda water, and various chemical
                    stuffs. Banking operations are conducted on a large scale, and printing and
                    publishing have long been of prime importance to the city. Printing was
                    introduced in 1478 by Steinschaben of Schweinfurth; and by 1563 there were 20
                    printing establishments in the city. Robert Stephen, having fled from Paris, was
                    received a citizen of Geneva in 1556; but his son Henry found that the
                    attentions of the consistory could be nearly as offensive and dangerous as those
                    of the Sorbonne, and the great printing establishment over which he presided
                    came to an untimely end. For details on the contribuions made by Genevese
                    inventors to the progress of the various arts, the reader may refer to

                <p>It would be hard to find a city of the same size as Geneva which could claim the
                    honour of being the birthplace of a greater number of eminent men; and still
                    harder perhaps to find one that had extended its hospitality to so many
                    foreigners of distinction. In the roll of its celebrities the first place is due
                    to Jean Jacques Rousseau, who, in spite of its treatment of him, retained

                    hardly more than local reputation. Rodolphe Toepffer, the humoristic novelist,
                    has attained a wider popularity, which may almost be called European. But the
                    really famous Genevese arc mostly men who have devoted themselves to the
                    sciences, or to the more utilitarian forms of literature. Among, the theologians
                    are Mestrezat, the opponent of the Jesuits; Diodati, the translator of the
                    Bible; the Tronchins, the Turrettines (Fr. and J. A.), Ed. Diodati, Felix Neff,
                    Caesar Malan, and Gaussen. Among the historical writers may be mentioned
                    Baulacre, Mallet (of Scandinavian celebrity), De Lolme, Grénus, Sismondi, Picot,
                    Cherbuliez, Sayous, Blavignac, and Galiffe; and among the philologists, Cramer,
                    Leclerc, Casaubon, and Spanheim. To the medical sciences belong the names of
                    Jean de Carro, Espine, and Charles de la Rive; and to the physical sciences
                    Bonnet, Huber, De Luc, De Saussure, De Candolle, and Pictet. Pradier, the
                    sculptor of the statue of Rousseau on the island in the Rhone, Chapponnière,

                <p>As far back as 1356 the town of Geneva is said to have contained 5800
                    inhabitants, and this by 1404 had increased to 6490, exclusive of the Bourg de
                    Four and St Gervais outside of the fortifications. In 1545 the number is given
                    as 12,500, but the plague and other causes had reduced it to 11,000 by 1572.
                    After the revocation of the edict of Nantes it rose to 16,934 in 1698, no fewer
                    than 3000 refugees having sought shelter within its walls. The 18th century was
                    marked by a steady increase: 18,500 in 1711, 24.712 in 1782, and 26,140 in 1789.
                    In 1850 the total was 31,238, of whom 5717 were from other parts of Switzerland,
                    and 6513 from other parts of the world. The census of 1870 gave 46,783, or
                    including the suburbs of Eaux Vives and Plainpalais, 61,486. The noteworthy fact
                    about this increase is that it is due solely to immigration, for the Genevese
                    families are far from prolific, and indeed have an indubitable tendency to die
                    out (Galiffe, <hi rend="italic">Geneve</hi><hi rend="italic">historique,</hi>

                <p>According to a well-known passage in Caesar’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries,</hi> he found Geneva the frontier town of the Allobroges, and
                    when he crossed the bridge which even then spanned the river, he was no longer
                    in the territory of the Allobroges but in that of the Helvetians. How long the
                    little <hi rend="italic">oppidum</hi> had been in existence before that time it
                    is impossible even to conjecture: that the spot had in far earlier days been
                    occupied by a cluster of crannogs may be accepted as rather more than a
                    conjecture, though the extensive formation of new land within the historic
                    period has completely buried whatever archaeological evidence might otherwise
                    have been available. There was a time clearly when the site of the present lower
                    town was entirely submerged, and the waters of the lake and river found their
                    shores along the edge of the rocky plateau of the upper town. The Allobroges
                    λvere, it would appear, a Celtic people, and the name Geneva, according to the
                    favourite etymology of modern investigators, has its explanation in the words
                    <hi rend="italic">gen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ev,</hi> the “issue” of the
                    “waters.” For several centuries of the Christian era the history of Geneva
                    remains a blank, but remains of substructions, aqueducts, canals, inscriptions,
                    statues, pottery, bronzes, arms, coins, &amp;c., show that during the Roman
                    period the town must have been a large and flourishing place, extending, if Μ.
                    Galiffe is right, over the plateau of the Tranchées. Christianity must have been
                    early introduced, the traditional apostles being Dionysius and Paracodus. In 456
                    the Celtic town passed under the dominion of the German Burgundians, and in 534
                    it was incorporated with the kingdom of the Franks. To Charles the Fat it was
                    indebted for the right, sanctioned by Pope John VIII., of electing its bishops
                    from among its own clergy. Optandus, the bishop whose election led to the
                    decision of this point, was a supporter of Eodolph I., founder of Transjuran
                    Burgundy; and it was at Geneva that Conrad the Salic caused himself to be
                    crowned king of Burgundy in 1033. This accession of Conrad proved in several
                    ways of moment to the town; for to him was due the first aggrandizement of the
                    house of Savoy, and from him was derived the temporal sovereignty of its
                    bishops. The counts of Genevois—a district to the south of the Genevan
                    territory, now included in the French department of Haute Savoie— were partly
                    reconciled to the loss of the authority they had previously had over the city
                    when in 1070 they saw Guy of Faucigny Genevois, a member of their own family,
                    elected to the episcopal see. The next bishop, however, Hubert or Humbert of
                    Grammont, laid claim to all the rights and possessions alienated by Guy; and at
                    length, in 1124, by the “Accord of Seyssel,” the count of Genevois recognized
                    the bishop as his superior under the emperor. Bishop Ardutius (1135-1185) had
                    again to oppose the encroachments of the counts; but the emperor Barbarossa, to
                    whom he appealed at the diet of Spires (1153), not only upheld his claims, but
                    made him prince of the empire. As the bishops could not always attend in person
                    to the civil concerns of his jurisdiction, a vidom or vidomne <hi rend="italic"
                    >{vice</hi><hi rend="italic">dominus)</hi> was appointed, who had to judge
                    according to the customs and usages of the city, and in difficult matters was
                    assisted by the advice of three or four citizens, two canons of Geneva, and two
                    nobles of the church. During the bishopric of Robert of Genevois (1277-1288),
                    the Genevese sought protection from the encroachments of his family at the hands
                    of the count of Savoy, Amadeus V.; and on Robert’s death a contest for
                    possession of the city took place between the count and the new bishop, William
                    of Conflans (1288-1294). In the resulting anarchy the citizens learned to act
                    for themselves, and in 1289 and 1291 λve find the bishop complaining of certain
                    procurators, syndics, or agents of the city who had acted as chief magistrates
                    in peace and war. In 1293, however, the syndicate was (for the time) abolished.
                    Between the count of Genevois, who held the castle at Bourg de Four, at the
                    corner of the city, and the count of Savoy, who by the peace of Asti in 1290 had
                    secured the office of vidomne, and now held the castle of the Island, both
                    citizens and bishop were hard bestead. In 1320 the castle of Bourg de Four was
                    demolished by Edward and Aymon, sons of the count of Savoy. When the emperor
                    Charles IV. visited Geneva on his way to Avignon (1365), Amadeus V., the “Green
                    Count,” obtained the rank of imperial vicar over the old kingdom of Burgundy and
                    over the city of Geneva; but William of Mar-cossay, who was bishop from 1366 to
                    1377, persuaded the emperor to abolish the vicariate by a bull at Frankfort
                    (1366), and by a second bull at Prague (1367) to cancel all rights granted to
                    the counts of Savoy over Geneva and its territory; and in 1371 Pope Gregory XI.
                    caused the count to withdraw from the city his castellan and judges. The year
                    1387 is a memorable ore in Genevese history, as the date of the publication by
                    Bishop Adhémar Fabri (1385-1388) of the franchises which served for centuries as
                    the Magna Charta of the city.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the countship of Genevois, Amadeus VIII. became possessor of all the country
                    round the city; and although he accepted investiture from the bishop and took
                    the oath of fealty, his ambition was simply biding its time. On the visit of
                    Sigismund in 1455, he was raised to be duke of Savoy; and when Pope Martin V.
                    shortly afterwards passed through the district, he sought to obtain complete
                    jurisdiction over tfie city. Jean de Pierrescise, however, appointed bishop at
                    the suggestion of the duke, who hoped to find in him an easy tool, was no sooner
                    occupant of the see than he appealed to the people, obtained their vote against
                    the alienation of the temporal rights of his predecessors, and swore in return
                    for their support to maintain their liberties. In 1420 a bull of the emperor
                    Sigismund formally declared that the city held directly of the empire. But by a
                    strange turn of events, the indefatigable Amadeus did ultimately become master
                    of Geneva,—not, indeed, by way of conquest or through the degradation of its
                    bishopric, but by himself succeeding to the bishop’s see. During the greater
                    part of his pontificate as Felix V. he resided in Geneva; and on his resignation
                    the council allowed him the administration of the bishoprics of Geneva and
                    Lausanne. In the latter part of the 15th century, amid the dissensions of the
                    house of Savoy, two facts deserve special notice for their effect on Geneva. The
                    duke Louis, irritated against the Genevese because they had admitted his
                    rebellious son Philip of Bresse within their walls, caused the king of France,
                    his son-in-law, to establish a fair at Lyons, which withdrew the greater part of
                    its traffic from the city of Lake Leman; and Bishop John Louis forming an
                    alliance with Charles the Bold, the Swiss (for Geneva was still the last town of
                    the Allobroges) inflicted a ransom of 20,000 crowns.</p>
                <p>The beginning of the 16th century brought the long contest between Savoy and
                    Geneva to a climax and a close. Into the struggle, interesting as it is, between
                    the Mamelukes (Mamelus) or ducal party and the Eidgnots (Eidgenossen) or
                    patriots, it is impossible to enter. The great heroes of the city are Philibert
                    Berthelier, Pierre Lévrier, François of Bonivard, the prior of St Victor, and
                    Besançon Hugues. To their patriotic devotion it owed its ultimate liberty, and
                    the alliances with Freiburg and Bern, which, first formed in 1519 and 1526, were
                    solemnly renewed in 1531. Meanwhile the Reformation was advancing in
                    Switzerland. In 1532 Farel entered the city, and in 1535 the reformed doctrine
                    was officially recognized as the religion of the state. In October 1536 a new
                    actor appeared on the scene— John Calvin, then about 25 years of age. By force
                    of intellect and strength of will he soon made himself the leader of the
                    Protestant party, and proceeded to work out his ideal of government and society.
                    While it rendered homage to many of the noblest elements of human nature, to
                    purity, to honesty, to industry, to benevolence, this ideal had grievous
                    defects; it forgot especially that all healthy moral action must be spontaneous,
                    and that in regard to deeds as well as men it is a dangerous thing to confound
                    the innocent with the guilty. The moral dictates of the sternest conscience of
                    the community were to be the binding laws of every citizen. Religious
                    observances were no longer to be the outcome of individual piety, but part of
                    the inevitable routine of daily life. The church became the state; breach of
                    ecclesiastical discipline was crime; innovation in dogma was treason. The
                    Genevese as a people appear to have been naturally religious: in the old
                    pre-Reformation times they had been distinguished for their liberality and
                    kindness to the clergy, their appreciation of a good preacher, the abundance of
                    their contributions for masses and prayers. Under the guidance of Calvin, this
                    religiosity took a new and sterner cast. But a certain part of the citizens were
                    not so willing to relinquish their liberty, and, under the name <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n161/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0161-0150"/> of Libertins or Liberty men, they contended
                    earnestly against the estabhshment of the new régime. In 1538 they were so
                    powerful that the four syndics were chosen from their ranks; and they had the
                    satisfaction of seeing Calvin and Farel, on 23d April, expelled from the city by
                    order of the little council, confirmed by the council of the two hundred and the
                    council-general. But the Libertins did not know how to rule; anarchy and licence
                    got possession of the city; the Catholic party recovered ground. Calvin was
                    recalled, and, returning on 3d September 1541, at once re-established his system
                    in all its vigour. The Libertin party again revolted; sixty of their number were
                    condemned to death, and four who failed to make their escape were beheaded. In
                    1547 Jacques Gruet was executed as an utterer of threats against the dictator
                    and a possessor of impious books; and in 1553 Michel Servctus was burned alive.
                    To the historian of Geneva it is of comparatively little importance whether or
                    not the main guilt of this too famous crime fell directly and solely on Calvin
                    himself; it is condemnation enough that such a deed was possible within the
                    walls of a city where his fiat and his veto were equally supreme. And on the
                    other hand, it must never be forgotten that the very reason why the faggot fire
                    in which Servetus perished has become such a beacon to after times, while the
                    smouldering embers round a Dolet or a Vanini are only now and then stirred to a
                    fitful glare, is that Calvin had made Geneva a city set upon a hill, and that
                    the lurid smoke and flame showed doubly dark against the clear light of his
                    wonderful intellect and his noble life. In some respects Geneva was never
                    greater than under his dictatorship. 11 was at once the moral capital of the
                    half of Christendom and the great frontier fortress against the invasions of
                    Rome. Like every fortress city, it had to pay the penalty of its position, and
                    the penalty was none the less because its garrison fought with spiritual
                    weapons, and its martial law interfered with the liberties of the mind. In 1564,
                    after twenty-three years of such labours as few men could rival, Calvin died,
                    and his body was laid in the cemetery of Plainpalais; but his spirit continued
                    to live in the constitution he had founded. The milder character of his
                    successor, Theodore Beza, allowed free scope to the other members of the
                    Government, and the democratic element obtained greater prominence. About 1564
                    Geneva appeared for a time in danger from its Catholic neighbours, and
                    especially from the duke of Savoy; but though this prince recovered possession
                    of the Chablais, the Genevois, and the country of Gex, and appointed Francis of
                    Sales titular bishop of Geneva, no direct attempt was made against the
                    independence of the city. The year 1568 is of note for a revision of the
                    constitution, drawn up by Germain Colladon, which, while retaining in the main
                    the Calvinistic framework, practically placed political power in the hands of a
                    feλv principal families. The administration nominally consisted of the syndicate
                    and four councils—the council of the twenty-five, the council of the sixty, the
                    council of the two hundred, and the council general; but the couneil of the
                    twenty-five, usually called the “little” or “narrow council,” managed in the
                    long run to arrogate the direction of all public affairs. During the 16th
                    century, both before and after the Colladon revision, the variety of affairs
                    which were considered under its jurisdiction is sufficiently amusing. It was at
                    once the foreign office of the republic and the high court and the police court
                    combined; and it accordingly passed, as matter of course, from the consideration
                    of matters of state, in which the potentates of Europe were parties, to the
                    squabbles of market women, the use of bad eggs in cakes, or the length of a
                    minister’s sermon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    “Le Petit Conseil” in Etrennes genevoises, Geneva, 1877.</p></note> Its private
                    deliberations were kept strictly secret: in 1491 the betrayer of any of its
                    transactions was judged “infamous,” and in 1530 it was added that his tongue
                    should be pierced. Torture was still retained as a legal instrument of
                    investigation, and the penal enactments against heresy and witchcraft remained
                    unrepealed. In 1579 the city was taken under the protection of Bern and Soleure,
                    and in 1584 it formed an alliance with Zurich; but these agreements proved of
                    little advantage, and in the conflicts whichwere always being renewed with the
                    duke of Savoy, Geneva was left to her own resources, and the accidental
                    assistance of Elizabeth of England or Henry IV. of France.</p>
                <p>At length, in 1602, Charles Emmanuel of Savoy determined to seize the city by a
                    <hi rend="italic">coup de main,</hi> and on the night of the 11th and 12th
                    December (0. S. ) an army of 8000 men were despatched against it. As no
                    declaration of war had been made, the citizens were taken by surprise; and the
                    enemy had fixed their scaling ladders and were already mounting the walls before
                    the alarm was given. But once aroused, the Genevese were not long in turning
                    this success into discomfiture and rout, and when morning broke the city was
                    once more safe, and a joyous crowd heard the voice of the aged Beza in the
                    cathedral read out the grand old Psalm, “Now may Israel say, If the Lord had not
                    been with us.” Such is the famous “Escalade,” the Bannockburn of the Genevese,
                    which has since been celebrated with all possible forms of celebration.<note

                    Représentations graphiques de l'Escalade, Geneva, 1869; and the drama of

                    following year the duke of Savoy granted the Genevese freedom of trade, restored
                    the lands of St Victor and St Peter, and promised to build no fortress and
                    assemble no troops within four leagues of the city; but the ambitious prince
                    made one more attack before his death in 1620. During the rest of the 17th
                    century the history of Geneva consists mainly of dissensions between different
                    councils, and between the governing bodies and the people; but amid them all the
                    city advanced in prosperity, especially after the accession to its population
                    occasioned by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. The 18th century brought
                    the political contest to a head. In 1707 Fatio, advocate and member of the two
                    hundred, was appointed president of a commission charged to formulate the
                    grievances of the people. In the document which he drew up he maintained the
                    sovereignty of the people, the equality of all citizens, and the subordination
                    of the magistracy as mere executive functionaries; and at the same time demanded
                    that the council-general should meet at least once a year, and not only when the
                    syndics chose. The councils appeared to yield, but shortly afterwards, supported
                    by confederates from the oligarchical cities of Bern and Zurich, they crushed
                    the popular party, and caused Fatio to be shot. How sternly they were disposed
                    to resent interference was shown in 1731 by their sentence of perpetual
                    imprisonment passed on Micheli Du Crest for merely giving expression to the
                    popular opposition to the new system of fortifications carried out by the
                    councils. The party of which he was so far a spokesman—known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">représentants</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> at length, in 1734,
                    gained a decided victory in the general council of 1734. By the edict of 1738,
                    though the whole initiative in matters of legislation was left in the hands of
                    the lesser councils, the actual passing of laws and fixing of taxes were
                    entrusted to the general council, and thirty years later the people obtained the
                    right of naming the half of the council of the two hundred. There was an
                    important class of the inhabitants, however, who were still excluded from
                    pelitical rights—the so-called “natives” or descendants of the aliens who had
                    settled in the city; and this class continued to make known its discontent. At
                    length, in 1782, Bern, Sardinia, and France interfered in favour of the
                    aristocratic party, and by the Act of Pacification the most important reforms in
                    a liberal sense were again abolished. A few years later, and France was under a
                    different régime. The Revolution at Paris was followed by a revolution at
                    Geneva. A new constitution, accepted by the National Assembly in 1794, declared
                    the political equality of all the Genevese; but, by a curious inconsistency, the
                    national committee of finances divided them again into aristocrats, the <hi
                    rend="italic">englués,</hi> and the patriots, taxing the last class much less
                    heavily than the others. In March 1798 it was agreed that Geneva should become a
                    part of the French republic, and on 13th June the French authorities entered the
                    city. By the treaty of Paris its independence was restored, and it became one of
                    the cantons of the Swiss confederation. A new constitution declared all the
                    citizens equal, and placed the legislative power in the hands of a
                    representative council. As no one, however, could be an elector who paid less
                    than 20 Swiss livres, or about 23 shillings, of direct taxes, the democratic
                    character of the system was considerably modified. It was not till 1841 that any
                    great change was effected. In the early part of that year the “Third of March
                    Society” was formed to watch over the interests of the citizens, and in October
                    the Government was forced by a popular demonstration to summon a constituent
                    assembly.</p>
                <p>The legislative power for the canton was now placed in a grand council,
                    consisting of representatives elected in the ratio of 1 to every 333
                    inhabitants; and the executive power in a council of state consisting of 13
                    members chosen by and from the grand council. At the same time the city received
                    a communal council of 81 members, and an administrative council of at most 11
                    members. But the new constitution was not allowed to work long. The radical
                    party had been gathering strength, especially in St Gervais, and in 1846 the
                    Government, finding that the attempt to suppress its opponents by force of arms
                    was of doubtful result, gave in its resignation. A provisional Government, under
                    the leadership of the democrat James Fazy, drew up a constitution, which was
                    accepted by the people on 24th May 1847. The franchise was bestowed even on the
                    pauper class of prolétaires, and the election of the council of state was
                    entrusted to the council general or collective assembly of citizens. The old
                    Protestant church of Geneva was abolished, and a new and almost creedless church
                    established, the government of which was vested in a consistory elected by the
                    universal suffrage of Protestants in the canton. For nearly fifteen years the
                    radical party continued in power; and under its hands the physical condition of
                    Geneva was rapidly transformed, and, for good or evil, the city was brought as
                    much as possible into the general current of European progress. ‘ ‘ On voudrait
                    faire de Genève,” sighed the conservative De le Rive, “la plus petite des
                    grandes villes, et pour moi je préféré qu’elle reste la plus grande des petites
                    villes.” Unfortunately for its permanence the radical Government was lavish in
                    its expenditure, and the finances of the canton and city got into a dangerous
                    condition. In November 1861 Fazy was not returned to the council of state; in
                    1862 the conservative party obtained a majority in the great council; and in
                    1863, though all the other radical candidates for the council of state were
                    carried, Fazy himself was rej ected. The attempt <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0162-0151"/> to invalidate the election of his opponent
                    Chenevière led to a conflict between the parties, in which some blood was shed;
                    and the city was consequently occupied by federal forces, and the matter
                    submitted to the federal council. As the decree was in favour of Chenevière,
                    Fazy retired from public life. The ‘ ‘ independents,” as the opponents of the
                    radicals are called, came into power in 1865, and for a number of years they
                    fully maintained their position, in spite of the difficulties thrown in their
                    way by the Ultramontane party. Their principal antagonist was Mermillod, the
                    vicar of the bishop of Freiburg, who was dèclared bishop of Geneva by the pope,
                    and insisted on exercising his episcopal functions without regard to the
                    Government. In February 1873 Mermillod was banished by the federal council of
                    Switzerland, and in the same year the grand council of Geneva deprived all Roman
                    Catholic priests who refused to take the oath of allegiance to the state. Fazy’s
                    bill for the separation of church and state was rejected in June 1876; religious
                    corporations were abolished on 23d August, and, on the 26th of the same month,
                    all public ecclesiastical services outside of the churches were forbidden. The
                    cathedral of Geneva was handed over to the Old Catholics. On the 6th of November
                    1878 Fazy died, and two days after the “conservative-democrat” party gained a
                    victory in the elections for the great council. The expelled curés were now
                    allowed to return, and in December the council accepted the principle of the
                    separation of church and state.</p>
