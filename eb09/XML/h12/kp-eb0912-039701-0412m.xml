                    inland county of England, situated between 52° 9' and 52° 35' N. lat. and 0° 3'
                    E. and 0° 30' W. long., and bounded on the N. and W. by Northampton, S. by
                    Bedford, and E. by Cambridge. Its extreme breadth is at the middle, from which
                    it narrows gradually and irregularly towards its north and south ends. Its
                    extreme length from north to south is about 30 miles, and its extreme breadth
                    from east to west about 23 miles. The area extends to 229,575 imperial acres, or
                    358 square miles. Among English counties it is the smallest, with the exception
                    of Middlesex and Rutland; and Rutland is the only English county it surpasses in
                    population.</p>
                <p>The surface of the county is low, and, with the exception of the Fen district,
                    pleasantly undulating. For the most part it is bare of trees. A low ridge of
                    hills enters the county from the south near Potton, and runs in a northward
                    direction until it terminates in the Ouse valley near Huntingdon; and a branch
                    of the Cambridgeshire hills enters the south-east part of the county, and from
                    Huntingdon runs north-west to Wansford. The north-eastern part of the county,
                    comprising 50,000 acres, or one-fifth of its whole extent, belongs to the great
                    “Fen” district extending throughout the counties of Cambridge, Lincoln,
                    Northampton, Norfolk, and Suffolk. The principal rivers are the Ouse and Nen.
                    The Ouse from Bedfordshire skirts the borders of the county near St Neots, and
                    after flowing north to Huntingdon takes an easterly direction past St Ives into
                    Cambridgeshire on it⅛ way to the Wash. It is navigable for barges as far as
                    Bedford, and in the fen district constitutes a means of transport for the
                    agricultural produce of the county. The Nen, which is also navigable, skirts the
                    northern border, and quitting it at Peterborough enters the Wash below Wisbeach,
                    in Cambridgeshire. Various cuts and drains which join the Nen and Ouse are also
                    made use of for navigation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology, Soil, and Agriculture.—</hi> Geologically
                    Huntingdonshire belongs to what is known as the Oolite system. The low round
                    hills in the south-eastern part of the county are composed of ironsand. They
                    contain a band of coprolites, and there is a strip of greensand on the
                    south-eastern border. The central and larger part of the county displays the
                    Oxford clay, which lies between the middle and lower Oolite. It reaches a depth
                    of nearly 100 feet, and passes under the Fens. The Fens are composed of fine
                    mud, deposited formerly by the sea, intermixed with beds of peat, in which are
                    frequently found the remains of animals, frequenters of the old forest, such as
                    the elk, the red-deer, the bear, the beaver, and the wolf. The hills on the
                    border of Northampton are of the stonebrash or forest marble. The Oolite
                    formation is very fossiliferous. Large masses of fossil wood converted into jet
                    or iron pyrites are found in the Oxford clay. Glacier or boulder clay containing
                    chalk and flint deposits is met with in nearly every part of the county. The
                    soil is generally fertile, and cultivation is of an advanced kind. In the fen
                    district the soil is of a blue peaty nature, resting on a subsoil of white marly
                    clay. After being drained and mixed with clay it is very productive, but much
                    damage is often done to the crops by the prevalence of frost and fogs. In the
                    fen districts a four-years’ system of cropping—green-crops, barley,
                    seed-clovers, and wheat—is the most common. The “Meres” of Whittlesea, Ramsey,
                    and Ugg, at one time much resorted to by sportsmen for their wildfowl and fish,
                    have now been drained, and, notwithstanding the expensiveness of the process,
                    such is the fertility of their beds that the outlay was speedily more than
                    repaid. The Oxford clay, which extends to an area of 120,000 acres, is of very
                    various soils according as the Oolite rocks crop to the surface. The greater
                    part is under cultivation, and much improvement has lately been effected by
                    drainage; on account of the tenacity of the clay the drains often require to be
                    placed very close.. Much of the soil is, however, undrained and uncultivated,
                    and, though partly used for pasturage, must on the whole be regarded as mere
                    waste land. On the drained pasturage a large number of cattle are fed. In this
                    district the system of cropping varies considerably, but a modification of the
                    four-course shift is the most common—fallow sown sometimes with winter tares,
                    turnips, mangold, or mustard; barley; beans where tares were sown on the fallow,
                    and clover where green crops were sown; wheat. A six-years’ course of fallow,
                    barley, seed-clovers, wheat, beans, and wheat is, however, not uncommon,
                    especially on the best soils. The third district, comprising the gravel of the
                    Ouse valley, embraces an area of 50,000 acres. On the banks of the Ouse it
                    consists of fine black loam deposited by the overflow of the river, and its
                    meadows form very rich pasture grounds. The upland district is under arable
                    culture, and is generally cultivated on a four-course system of wheat, green
                    crops, barley, and seed-clover. Market-gardening is prosecuted; and willows are
                    largely grown in the fen district. The farms vary in size from 200 to 500 acres,
                    ranging chiefly between 200 and 300. The farm-houses are generally of an
                    inferior kind, and the farm-buildings are often quite inadequate for the shelter
                    and accommodation of the stock. The labourers generally live in villages and
                    hamlets, in cottages of the most miserable description, having mostly mud walls;
                    but many cottages of a better class have been built within the last few years.
                    The county is well supplied with turnpike roads; and the parish and occupation
                    roads, formerly in a bad state of repair, have been lately much improved. The
                    most modern improvements in farm implements are in general use.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1879 the total area of arable land was
                    209,610 acres, of which 96,533 were under corn crop, 21,931 under green crop,
                    17,121 under rotation grasses, 60,484 permanent pasture, and 13,531 fallow. The
                    area under woods was 20,714 acres. Wheat, which in 1879 cropped 43,129 acres, is
                    much more largely grown than any other grain, and occurs twice in the six-years’
                    shift system in use on the better lands. Barley (27,118 acres) is the more
                    frequent corn crop in the four-years’ shift system,—only 10,247 acres being
                    under oats. The quality of barley on many soils is lean and inferior, and
                    unsuitable for malting purposes. Beans and pease occupied 8948 and 6929
                    respectively. Mangold (3430 acres) and cabbage and similar green crops (2863
                    acres) are chiefly used for the feeding of sheep. Under turnips there were only
                    3778 acres, and under potatoes 3083. The number of cattle in 1879 was 27,358, or
                    an average of 13 to every 100 acres under cultivation, as compared with 16 9 for
                    England and 21Ό for the United Kingdom. Of these the number of cows and heifers
                    in milk or in calf was 7536. Though Stilton in Huntingdon gives its name to a
                    celebrated cheese, that variety is now made exclusively in the counties of
                    Lincoln and Leicester; and dairy farming is not now much followed. The milk is
                    now chiefly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0413-0398"/> used for rearing calves. Large numbers of cattle
                    are fattened in the field or the fold-yard, and are sold when rising three years
                    old. They are mostly of the shorthorn breed, large numbers of Irish shorthorns
                    being wintered in the fens. Where there are no upland pastures the farmer
                    usually purchases cattle in the autumn and sells them in the spring. The number
                    of horses in 1879 was 11,057, or an average of 4 ’ 2 to every 100 acres under
                    cultivation, as compared with 4’5 for England and 4Ί for the United Kingdom. Of
                    these the number used solely for agricultural purposes was 7583. Most of the
                    farmers breed cart horses, and the large farmers often rear weight-carrying
                    hunters. The number of sheep in 1879 was 157,790, or an average of 75 ’ 3 to
                    every 100 acres under cultivation, as compared with the same average for England
                    and 68Ό for the United Kingdom. Great improvement in the breed has lately taken
                    place, Leicesters and Lincolns being most common; they usually attain great
                    weights at an early age. Lambs are occasionally sold at weaning time, but more
                    frequently they are kept through the winter on the grass lands, being fed also
                    on mangolds and other roots, with an addition of cake and corn. The number of
                    pigs in 1879 was 19,990, or an average of 9’5 to every 100 acres under
                    cultivation, as compared with 7’2 for England and 6’7 for the United Kingdom.
                    They include Berkshire, Suffolk, and Neapolitan breeds, and a number of crosses.
                    Many after having gleaned the stubbles are fattened on whey and various
                    preparations of inferior barley; but breeding is also extensively practised.</p>
                <p>According to the owners of lands return for 1873 the land was divided among 3903
                    proprietors, holding land the gross annual value of which was &lt;£444,890. Of
                    the owners 45f∙ per cent, possessed less than 1 acre, and the average value all
                    over was £1, 19s. 4∣d. per acre. There were 13 proprietors holding upwards of
                    3000 acres, viz., Edward Fellowes, 15,629; Duke of Manchester, 13,835; William
                    Wells, 5792; Marquis of Huntly, 5711; Hon. G. W. Fitzwilliam, 5202; Lord
                    Chesham, 3787; Earl of Carysfort, 3654; Ecclesiastical Commissioners, 3559;
                    Colonel Duncombe, 3407; W. Duberley, 3224; Earl of Sandwich, 3219; G. D. Newton,
                    3209; Richard H. Hussey, 3135.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> Agriculture is the principal
                    industry, and none of the manufactures are extensive, the chief being paper and
                    parchment. Madder is obtained in considerable quantities, and in nearly every
                    part of the shire lime burning is carried on. Lace-making is practised by the
                    female peasantry; and the other industries, which are not prosecuted beyond what
                    is necessary to meet local wants, are printing, iron-founding, tanning,
                    currying, brick and tile making, malting, and brewing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The middle of the county is traversed from
                    south to north by the Great Northern, which enters it at St Neots and passes by
                    Huntingdon to Peterborough. A branch from the Midland enters the middle of the
                    county from Northampton, and passes by Graffham to Huntingdon, where it is
                    joined by a branch which passes by St Ives to the Great Eastern in
                    Cambridgeshire. From St Ives there is a branch to Wisbeach in Cambridgeshire,
                    and another has been constructed to Stilton. On the Great Northern there is a
                    branch from Holme to Ramsey.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Huntingdonshire comprises four
                    “hundreds.” For parliamentary purposes it is an undivided constituency returning
                    two members; and it contains one parliamentary borough, that of Huntingdon,
                    formed of Huntingdon (4243) and Godmanchester (2363), and returning one member.
                    Part of the represented city of Peterborough is also in the county. The
                    principal other towns are Ramsey (2378), St Ives (3291), St Neots (3200), and
                    Kimbolton (1509). The county has one court of quarter sessions. It is included
                    in the south-eastern circuit, and circuit courts are held at Huntingdon. It
                    forms part of the shrievalty of Cambridge, and ecclesiastically is in the
                    diocese of Ely.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population in 1841 amounted to 58,549, in
                    1851 to 64,183, in 1861 to 64,250, and in 1871 to 63,708 (31,381 males and
                    32,327 females). The increase in thirty years from 1841 has been 8’8 per cent.,
                    and since 1801 it has been 69 ’ 5 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Previous to the Roman invasion
                    Huntingdonshire, like the other Fen counties, was inhabited by the British tribe
                    the Iceni, originally of Celtic origin, but considerably intermixed from
                    Teutonic sources, although the Belgae in all probability did not subdue the
                    country as far north as Huntingdon. During the Roman occupation it was included
                    in the Roman province of <hi rend="italic">Flavia Caesariensis.</hi> Two Roman
                    stations are supposed to have been situated in the county, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Durolipons</hi> (Godmanchester) and <hi rend="italic">Durobrivoe</hi> at Water
                    Newton on the Nen. The Roman road <hi rend="italic">Via Devana</hi> from
                    Cambridge joined Ermine Street at Godmanchester, Ermine Street passing
                    north-west by Water Newton into Northampton. Under the name of Huntandunscyre,
                    Huntingdon formed part of the kingdom of East Anglia, afterwards joined to
                    Mercia. Shortly before the Conquest the earldom of Huntingdon was held by Swend,
                    who, on receiving the earldom of Northampton, granted it to his son Waltheof,
                    who married a niece of William the Conqueror; and, on Waltheofs execution for
                    high treason, it passed to a Norman soldier, Simon de St Liz, who married a
                    daughter of Waltheof. On the death of St Liz, David, afterwards king of
                    Scotland, married his widow, and inherited the earldom in her right, but on
                    account of the subsequent feuds between the English and Scottish monarchs the
                    earldom frequently exchanged hands between the heirs of St Liz and the heirs of
                    David. It is at present borne by a branch of the Hastings family. A great part
                    of the county was held by the monks, who erected two great abbeys at Ramsey and
                    at Sawtry St Judith,and priories at Huntingdon,St Ives, St Neots, and
                    Hinchingbrook. Of these buildings all that now remains is the richly decorated
                    ruined gateway of the abbey of Ramsey, and a dovehouse, a barn, and a few
                    unimportant fragments at St Ives. There were two ancient castles at Huntingdon
                    and Kimbolton; the one at the latter place, now the seat of the Montagues, dukes
                    of Manchester, was the residence of Catherine of Aragon after her divorce from
                    Henry VIII. Another mansion of interest is Hinchingbrook House, the ancient seat
                    of the Cromwell family. Among the old churches may be mentioned Alwalton,
                    Conington, Hartford, Leighton Bromswold, and Ramsey, which contain remains of
                    Roman architecture; Buckden, Elton, Godmanchester, and St Neots, which contain
                    good specimens of the Perpendicular; Chesterton, Holywell, Sawtry, Upton, and
                    Wooton, which are partly Early English. The only events of historical importance
                    connected with the shire are the capture of the castle of Huntingdon by the
                    Royalists under Charles I. in 1645, and the rout at St Neots of one hundred
                    horse under the command of the duke of Buckingham and the earl of Holland by the
                    Parliamentary soldiers, who took the earl of Holland prisoner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Huntingdon,</hi> a municipal and parliamentary borough of
                    England, capital of the above county, is situated on the left bank of the Ouse,
                    and on three railway lines, 58 miles north of London, 15 miles north-west of
                    Cambridge, and 19 miles south of Peterborough. It consists principally of one
                    street about a mile in length, from which small streets branch off at various
                    points. By a fine bridge erected in the 13th century it is connected with the
                    municipal borough of Godmanchester, which, consisting principally of cottages,
                    forms practically one of its suburbs, and is included in the parliamentary
                    borough of Huntingdon. In Huntingdon there are two old churches—All Saints,
                    probably dating originally from the time of the Normans, but re-erected in the
                    time of Henry VIII., and St Mary’s, probably occupying the site of the old
                    priory, but rebuilt in the Gothic style after the fall of the old building in
                    1608, and restored in 1876. The church of Godmanchester, of the date 1625, is
                    also a fine structure in the late Perpendicular, with a tower and spire. At the
                    grammar school of Huntingdon, founded in 1200 by David,king of Scotland, but
                    pulled down in 1877 for the erection of a new building, Oliver Cromwell received
                    his education. Among the other schools are Walden’s school for 64 boys, and a
                    national school. There are also in Godmanchester a grammar school <pb break="no"

                    buildings of Huntingdon are the county jail, completed in 1827; the militia
                    barracks, erected in 1852; the town and county hospital, erected in 1853; the
                    com exchange; the townhall, whose ground floor is used for the courts of
                    justice; and the rooms of the literary and scientific institution. The house in
                    which Oliver Cromwell was born is still standing. Of the three old monastic
                    foundations formerly belonging to the town there are now no remains. The
                    industries of Huntingdon and Godmanchester are very much alike. They possess
                    iron-foundries, breweries, tileworks, and oil and flour mills. The area of the
                    parliamentary borough of Huntingdon is 6086 acres, the municipal boroughs of
                    Godmanchester and Huntingdon occupying 4970 acres and 1116 acres respectively.
                    In 1871 the population of the parliamentary borough was 6606, that of the
                    municipal boroughs of Godmanchester and Huntingdon being respectively 2363 and
                    4243.</p>
                <p>Huntingdon existed in the time of the Saxons under the name of Huntantun, and in
                    the Norman survey it is mentioned as Hunters-dune. The castle erected at it by
                    Edward the Elder in 919, and afterwards enlarged by David, king of Scotland, was
                    demolished by the orders of Henry II. In 1645 the town was plundered by the
                    Royalists under Charles I. The origin of the town was doubtless closely
                    connected with that of Godmanchester, which occupied the site of the Roman
                    station <hi rend="italic">Durolipons,</hi> and at which a castle is said to have
                    been founded by Gormund (hence the name of the town, formerly Gormunchester), a
                    Danish chief in the reign of Alfred the Great. Huntingdon was first incorporated
                    in 1206 and Godmanchester in 1605. From an early period Huntingdon returned two
                    members to parliament; but the Reform Act of 1867 reduced the representation to
                    one member.</p>
