                <p><label type="entry">HYDROMETER</label>. The object of the hydrometer is the
                    determination of the density of bodies, generally of fluids, but some forms of
                    the instrument are adapted to the determination of the density of solids.</p>
                <p>It is shown in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydromechanics</hi> that, when a
                    body floats in a fluid under the action of gravity, the weight of the body is
                    equal to that of the fluid which it displaces. It is upon this principle that
                    the hydrometer is constructed, and it obviously admits of two modes of
                    application in the case of fluids: either we may compare the weights of floating
                    bodies which are capable of displacing the same volume of different fluids, or
                    we may compare the volumes of the different fluids which are displaced by the
                    same weight. In the latter case, the densities of the fluids will be
                    inversely-proportional to the volumes thus displaced.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the simplest method of experimentally determining the densities of
                    different liquids is afforded by the series of areometrical glass beads, or
                    hollow balls, first proposed by Dr Wilson, professor of astronomy in the
                    university of Glasgow. As subsequently improved by Mrs Lovi, these beads were
                    constructed in sets, each bead in the set differing in density from its
                    predecessor by Ό02 (of the density of water). Each bead is numbered according to
                    its density, and in order to determine the specific gravity of a liquid it is
                    only necessary to throw into it the set of beads, or so many of them as are
                    known to include between their extremes the density of the liquid, when all the
                    beads whose densities exceed that of the liquid will sink, while those whose
                    densities are less than that of the liquid will float. If there is a bead of
                    exactly the same density as the liquid, it will rest in any position, provided
                    it is completely immersed. Failing this, all that is immediately apparent is
                    that the density is intermediate between that of the lightest bead that sinks
                    and that of the heaviest that floats. For example, if all the beads numbered 1 ’
                    466 and upwards sink, while those below 1 ’ 466 float, it is obvious that the
                    density of the liquid is intermediate between 1 ’ 464 and 1∙466. In the case of
                    most fluids the intervals may be divided approximately by slightly warming the
                    liquid. Thus, if on heating the liquid 6° C. it is found that the bead 1’466
                    begins to sink, and on heating it still farther through 12° C. <hi rend="italic"
                        >(i.e.,</hi> through 18° C. altogether) the bead 1 ’ 468 begins to sink,
                    then the density of the liquid is approximately 1 465.</p>

                    appears to have been neglected until it was reinvented by Robert Boyle, whose
                    “New Essay Instrument,” as described in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trane,</hi>
                    for June 1675, differs in no essential particular from Nicholson’s hydrometer.
                    This instrument was devised for the purpose of detecting counterfeit coin,
                    especially guineas and half-guineas. In the first section of the paper <hi
                        rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> No. 115, p. 329) the author refers to a
                    glass instrument exhibited by himself many years before, and “consisting of a
                    bubble furnished with a long and slender stem, which was to be put into several
                    liquors, to compare and estimate their specific gravities.” This seems to be the
                    first reference to the hydrometer in modern times.</p>
                <p>In fig. 1 C represents the instrument used for guineas, the circular plates A
                    representing plates of lead, which are used as ballast when lighter coins than
                    guineas are examined. B represents “a small glass instrument for estimating the
                    specific gravities of liquors,” an account of which was promised by Boyle in the
                    following number of the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> but did not
                    appear.</p>
                <p>The instrument represented at B (fig. 1), which is copied from Robert Boyle’s
                    sketch in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> for 1675, is generally known
                    as the common hydrometer. It is usually made of glass, the lower bulb being
                    loaded with mercury or small shot which serves as bal last, causing the
                    instrument to float with the stem vertical. The quantity of mercury or shot
                    inserted depends upon the density of the liquids for which the hydrometer is to
                    be employed, it being essential that the whole of the bulb should be immersed in
                    the heaviest liquid for which the instrument is used, while the length and
                    diameter of the stem must be such that the hydrometer will float in the lightest
                    liquid for which it is required. The stem is usually divided into a number of
                    equal parts, the divisions of the scale being varied in different instruments,
                    according to the purposes for which they are employed.</p>
                <p>Let V denote the volume of the instrument immersed (i.e., of liquid displaced)
                    when the surface,of the liquid in which the hydrometer floats coincides with the
                    lowest division of the scale, A the area of the transverse section of the stem,

                    inversely as the respective volumes of the instrument immersed in them; and,
                    since the divisions of the scale correspond to equal increments of
                    volume-immersed, it follows that the densities of the several liquids in which
                    the instrument sinks to the successive divisions form a harmonic series.</p>

                    the stem and of volume V, the indications of the instrument will be in no
                    respect altered, and the bottom of the bar will be at a distance of N
                    scaledivisions below the zero of the scale.</p>

                <p>If we wish the successive divisions of the scale to correspond to equal

                    series in harmonical progression, the lengths of the divisions increasing as we
                    go up the stem.</p>
                <p>The greatest density of the liquid for which the instnιment described above can

                <p>the extreme divisions of the scale. Now, by increasing <hi rend="italic">v,</hi>
                    leaving W and V unchanged, we may increase the range of the instrument
                    indefinitely. But it is clear that if we increase Λ, the sectional area of the
                    stem, we shall diminish <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> the length of a scale-division
                    corresponding to a given variation of density, and thereby proportionately
                    diminish the sensibility of the instrument, while diminishing the section A will
                    .increase <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and proportionately increase the sensibility,
                    but will diminish the range over which the instrument can be employed, unless we
                    increase the length of the stem in the inverse ratio of the sectional area.
                    Hence, to obtain great sensibility along with a considerable range, we require
                    very long slender stems, and to these two objections apply in addition to the
                    question of portability; for, in the first place, an instrument with a very long
                    stem requires a very deep vessel of liquid for its complete immersion, and, in
                    the second place, when most of the stem is above the plane of flotation, this
                    diminishes or may destroy the stability of the instrument when floating. The
                    various devices which have been adopted to overcome this difficulty will be
                    described in the account given of the several hydrometers which have been
                    hitherto generally employed.</p>
                <p>The plan commonly adopted to obviate the necessity of inconveniently long stems
                    is to construct a number of hydrometers as nearly alike as may be, but to load
                    them differently, so that the scaledivisions at the bottom of the stem of one
                    hydrometer just overlap those at the top of the stem of the preceding. By this
                    means a set of six hydrometers, each having a stem rather more than five inches
                    long, will be equivalent to a single hydrometer with a stem of thirty inches.
                    But, instead of employing a number of instruments differing only in the weights
                    with which they are loaded, we may employ the same instrument, and alter its
                    weight either by adding mercury or shot to the interior (if it can be opened) or
                    by attaching weights to the exterior. These two operations are not quite
                    equivalent, since a weight added to the interior does not affect the volume of
                    liquid displaced when the instrument is immersed up to a given division of the
                    scale, while the addition of weights to the exterior increases the displacement.
                    This difficulty may be met, as in Keene’s hydrometer, by having all the weights
                    of precisely the same volume but of different masses, and never using the
                    instrument except with one of these weights attached.</p>
                <p>The first hydrometer intended for the determination of the densities of liquids,
                    and furnished with a set of weights to be attached when necessary, was that
                    constructed by Mr Clarke, and described by Dresaguliers in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for March and April 1730, No. 413, p. 278.
                    The following is Desaguliers’s account of the instrument (fig. 2) :—</p>
                <p>“After having made several fruitless trials with ivory, because it imbibes
                    spirituous liquors, and thereby alters its gravity, he (Mr Clarke) at last made
                    a copper hydrometer, represented in fig. 2, having a brass wire of about 1 inch
                    thick going through, and soldered into the copper ball BA The upper part of this
                    wire is filed flat on one side, for the stem of the hydrometer, with a mark at
                        <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> to which it sinks exactly in proof spirits. There
                    are two other marks, A and B, at top and bottom of the stem, to show whether the
                    liquor be <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛th above proof (as when it sinks to A),
                    or ,⅛th under proof (as when it emerges to B), when a brass weight such as C has
                    been screwed on to the bottom at c. There are a great many such weights, of
                    different sizes, and marked to be screwed on instead of C, for liquors that
                    differ more than <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th from proof, so as to serve for
                    the specific gravities in all such proportions as relate to the mixture of
                    spirituous liquors, in all the variety made use of in trade. There are also
                    other balls for showing the specific gravities quite to common water, which make
                    the instrument perfect in its kind.”</p>
                <p>Clarke’s hydrometer, as afterwards constructed for the purposes of the excise,
                    was provided with thirty-two weights to adapt it to spirits of different
                    specific gravities, and eleven smaller weights, or “weather weights” as they
                    were called, which were attached to the instrument in order to correct for
                    variations of temperature. The weights were adjusted for successive intervals of
                    5° Fahr., but for degrees intermediate between these no additional correction
                    was applied. The correction for temperature thus afforded was not sufficiently
                    accurate for excise purposes, and Mr Speer in his essay on the hydrometer
                    (Tilloch’s <hi rend="italic">Phil. May.,</hi> vol. xiv.) mentions cases in which
                    this imperfect compensation led to the extra duty payable upon spirits which
                    were more than 10 per cent, over proof being demanded on spirits which were
                    purposely diluted to below 10 per cent, over proof in order to avoid the
                    charge.</p>
                <p>Desaguliers himself constructed a hydrometer of the ordinary type for comparing
                    the specific gravities of different kinds of water (Desaguliers’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Experimental Philosophy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 234). In order to
                    give great sensibility to the instrument, the large glass ball was made nearly 3
                    inches in diameter, while the stand consisted of a wire 10 inches in length and
                    only <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ inch in diameter. The instrument weighed
                    4000 grains, and the addition of a grain caused it to sink through an inch. By
                    altering the quantity of shot in the small balls the instrument could be adapted
                    for liquids other than water.</p>
                <p>To an instrument constructed for the same purpose, but on a still larger scale
                    than that of Desaguliers, M. De· parcieux added a small dish on the top of the
                    stem for the reception of the weights necessary to sink the instrument to a
                    convenient depth. The effect of weights placed in such a dish or pan is of
                    course the same as if they were placed within the bulb of the instrument, since
                    they do not alter the volume of that part which is immersed.</p>
                <p>The first important improvement in the hydrometer after its reinvention by Boyle
                    was introduced by Fahrenheit, who adopted the second mode of construction above
                    referred to, arranging his instrument so as always to displace the same volume
                    of liquid, its weight being varied accordingly. Instead of a scale, only a
                    single mark is placed upon the stem, which is very slender, and bears at the top
                    a small scale pan into which weights are placed until the instrument sinks to
                    the mark upon its stem. The volume of the displaced liquid being then always the
                    same, its density will be proportional to the whole weight supported, that is,
                    to the weight of the instrument together with the weights required to be placed
                    in the scale pan.</p>
                <p>Nicholson’s hydrometer (fig. 3) combines the characteristics of Fahrenheit’s
                    hydrometer and of Boyle’s essay instrument. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The

                <p>In comparing the densities of different liquids, it is clear that this instrument
                    is precisely equivalent to that of Fahrenheit, and must be employed in the same
                    manner, weights being placed in the top scale only until the hydrometer sinks to
                    the mark on the wire, when the specific gravity of the liquid will be
                    proportional to the weight of the instrument together with the weights in the
                    scale.</p>

                <p>Nicholson explains how the instrument may be employed as a thermometer, since,
                    fluids generally expanding more than the solids of which the instrument is
                    constructed, the instrument will sink as the temperature rises.</p>
                <p>To determine the density of solids heavier than water with this instrument, let
                    the solid be placed in the upper scale pan, and let the weight now required to
                    cause the instrument to sink in distilled water at standard temperature to the
                    mark B be denoted by <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> while W denotes the weight
                    required when the solid is not present. Then W <hi rend="italic">-w</hi> is the
                    weight of the solid. Now let the solid be placed in the lower pan, care being
                    taken that no bubbles of air remain attached to it, and let <hi rend="italic"
                        >w</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> be the weight now required in the
                    scale pan. This weight will exceed <hi rend="italic">w</hi> in consequence of
                    the water displaced by the solid, and the weight of the water thus displaced
                    will be <hi rend="italic">w</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">- w,</hi> which is therefore the weight of a volume of water
                    equal to that of the solid. Hence, since the weight of the</p>

                <p>The above example illustrates how Nicholson’s or Fahrenheit’s hydrometer may be
                    employed as a weighing machine for small weights.</p>
                <p>In all hydrometers in which a part only of the instrument is immersed, there is a
                    liability to error in consequence of the surface tension, or capillary action,
                    as it is frequently called, along the line of contact of the instrument and the
                    surface of the liquid (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Capillary Action).</hi> This
                    error diminishes as the diameter of the stem in reduced, but is sensible in the
                    case of Hie thinnest stem which can be employed, and is the chief source of
                    error in the employment of Nicholson’s hydrometer, which otherwise would be an
                    instrument of extreme delicacy and precision. The following is Nicholson’s
                    statement on this point:—</p>
                <p>“One of the greatest difficulties which attends hydrostatical experiments arises
                    from the attraction or repulsion that obtains at the surface of the water. After
                    trying many experiments to obviate the irregularities arising from this cause, I
                    find reason to prefer the simple one of carefully wiping the whole instrument,
                    and especially the stem, with a clean cloth. The weights in the dish must not be
                    esteemed accurate while there is either a cumulus or a cavity in the water round
                    the stem.”</p>
                <p>It is possible by applying a little oil to the upper part of the bulb of a common
                    or of a Sikes’s hydrometer, and carefully placing it in pure water, to cause it
                    to float with the upper part of the bulb and the whole of the stem emerging as
                    indicated in fig. 4, when it ought properly to sink almost to the top of the
                    stem, the surface tension of the water around the circumference of the circle of
                    contact, AA', providing the additional support required.</p>
                <p>The universal hydrometer of Mr G. Atkins, described in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phil. Mag.</hi> for 1808, vol. xxxi. p. 254, is merely Nicholson’s
                    hydrometer with the screw at C projecting through the collar into which it is
                    screwed, and terminating in a sharp point above the cup G. To this point soft
                    bodies lighter than water (which would float if placed in the cup) could be
                    attached, and thus completely immersed. Atkins’s instrument was constructed so
                    as to weigh 700 grains, and when immersed to the mark on the stem in distilled
                    water at 60° F., it carried 300 grains in the upper dish. The hydrometer
                    therefore displaced 1000 grains of distilled water at 60° F., and hence the
                    specific gravity of any other liquid was at once indicated by adding 700 to the
                    number of grains in the pan required to make the instrument sink to the mark on
                    the stem. The small divisions •on the scale corresponded to differences of <hi
                        rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of a grain in the weight of the instrument.</p>
                <p>The “Gravimeter,” constructed by Citizen Guyton and described in <hi
                        rend="italic">Nicholson's Journal,</hi> 4to, vol. i. p. 110, differs from
                    Nicholson’s instrument in being constructed of glass, and having a cylindrical
                    bulb about 21 centimetres in length and 22 millimetres in diameter. Its weight
                    is so adjusted that an additional weight of 5 grammes must be placed in the
                    upper pan to cause the instrument to sink to the mark on the stem in distilled
                    water at the standard temperature. The instrument is provided with an additional
                    piece, or “plongeur,” whose weight exceeds 5 grammes by the weight of water
                    which it displaces; that is to say, it is so constructed as to weigh 5 grammes
                    in water, and consists of a glass envelope filled with mercury. It is clear that
                    the effect of this “plongeur,” when placed in the lower pan, is exactly the same
                    as that of the 5 gramme weight in the upper pan. Without the extra 5 grammes the
                    instrument weighs about 20 grammes, and therefore floats in a liquid of specific
                    gravity ’ 8. Thus deprived of its additional weight it may be used for spirits.
                    To use the instrument for liquids of much greater density than water additional
                    weights must be placed in the upper pan, and the “plongeur” is then placed in
                    the lower pan for the purpose of giving to the instrument the requisite
                    stability.</p>
                <p>Charles’s balance areometer is similar to Nicholson’s hydrometer, except that the
                    lower basin admits of inversion, thus enabling the instrument to be employed for
                    solids lighter than water, the inverted basin serving the same purpose as the
                    pointed screw in Atkins’s modification of the instrument.</p>
                <p>Adie’s sliding hydrometer is of the ordinarj <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> form,
                    but can be adjusted for liquids of widely differing specific gravities by
                    drawing out a sliding tube, thus changing the volume of the hydrometer while its
                    weight remains constant.</p>
                <p>Adie’s statical hydrometer is really a specific gravity balance, one of the arms
                    of which is 2⅜ inches in length, and the other 8 inches. A brass ball, whose
                    volume is Ό1 gallon, is suspended from the shorter arm, and immersed in the
                    liquid whose density is to be determined. The ball is balanced by means of a
                    weight which slides along the beam, and a smaller weight which also slides along
                    the beam serves to make the necessary correction for temperature.</p>
                <p>The hydrometer of Beaumé, which has been extensively used in France, consists of
                    a common hydrometer graduated in the following manner. Certain fixed points were
                    first determined upon the stem of the instrument. The first of these was found
                    by immersing the hydrometer in pure water, and marking the stem at the level of
                    the surface. This formed the zero of the scale. Fifteen standard solutions of
                    pure common salt in water were then prepared, containing respectively 1, 2, 3, .
                    . . . 15 per cent, (by weight) of dry salt. The hydrometer was plunged in these
                    solutions in order, and the stem having been marked at the several surfaces, the
                    degrees so obtained were numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . . 15. These degrees were, when
                    necessary, repeated along the stem by the employment of a pair of compasses till
                    80 degrees were marked off. The instrument thus adapted to the determination of
                    densities exceeding that of water was called the hydrometer for salts.</p>
                <p>The hydrometer intended for densities less than that of water, or the hydrometer
                    for spirits, is constructed on a similar principle. The instrument is so
                    arranged that it floats in pure water with most of the stem above the surface. A
                    solution containing 10 per cent, of pure salt is used to indicate the zero of
                    the scale, and the point at which the instrument floats when immersed in
                    distilled water at 10° R. (54⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> F.) is numbered
                    10. Equal divisions are then marked off upwards along the stem as far as the
                    50th degree.</p>
                <p>The densities corresponding to the several degrees of Beaume’s hydrometer are

                <p>Cartier’s hydrometer was very similar to that of Beaumé, Cartier <pb break="no"

                    construct his instruments for the French revenue. The point at which the
                    instrument floated in distilled water was marked 10° by Cartier, and 30“ on
                    Cartier’s scale corresponded to 32° on Beaumé’s.</p>
                <p>Though constructed upon a very different principle from ordinary hydrometers, we
                    may briefly refer here to Brewster’s capillary hydrometer or staktometer, which
                    is based upon the difference in the surface tension and density of pure water,
                    and of mixtures of alcohol and water in varying proportions. If a small piece of
                    paper be bent into such a shape as this, _/\_, it maybe made to rest upon the
                    surface of water without being immersed. If now a drop of alcohol be placed on
                    one corner of the paper, it will rush violently away and generally spin round,
                    somewhat resembling the action of pieces of camphor, indicating that the surface
                    tension of the water is diminished by the presence of alcohol. If the water be
                    very pure it is sufficient to bring a drop of alcohol on the extremity of a
                    pipette near to the paper, without touching either it or the water, and the
                    vapour absorbed will produce the same effect. For other proofs of the same
                    action see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Capillary Action. Now,</hi> if a
                    drop of water be allowed to form at the extremity of a fine tube, it will go on
                    increasing until its weight overcomes the surface tension by which it clings to
                    the tube, and then it will fall. Hence any impurity which diminishes the surface
                    tension of the water will diminish the size of the drop (unless the density is
                    proportionately diminished). Now, according to Quincke, the surface tension of
                    pure water in contact with air at 20° C. is 81 dynes per linear centimetre,
                    while that of alcohol is only 25’5 dynes. Also, a small percentage of alcohol
                    produces much more than a proportional decrease in the surface tension when
                    added to pure water. The capillary hydrometer consists simply of a small pipette
                    with a bulb in the middle of the stem, the pipette terminating in a veryfine
                    capillary point. The instrument being filled with distilled water, the number of
                    drops required to empty the bulb and portions of the stem between two marks <hi
                        rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> (fig. 5) on the latter is
                    carefully counted, and the experiments repeated at different temperatures. The
                    pipette having been carefully dried, the process is repeated with pure alcohol
                    or with proof spirits, and the strength of any admixture of water and spirits is
                    determined from the Corresponding number of drops, but the formula generally
                    given is not based upon sound data. Sir David Brewster found with one of these
                    instruments that the number of drops of pure water was 734, while of proof
                    spirit, sp. gr. 920, the number of drops required was 2117.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the main object for which hydrometers have been constructed is the
                    determination of the value of spirituous liquors, chiefly for revenue purposes.
                    To this end an immense variety of hydrometers have been constructed, differing
                    mainly in the character of their scales.</p>
                <p>In Speer’s hydrometer the stem has the form of an octagonal prism, and upon each
                    of the eight faces a scale is engraved, indicating the percentage strength of
                    the spirit corresponding to the several divisions, of the scale, the eight
                    scales being adapted respectively to the temperatures 35°, 40°, 45’, 50°, 55°,
                    60°, 65°, and 70’ F. Four small pins, which can be inserted into the
                    counterpoise of the instrument, serve to adapt the instrument to the
                    temperatures intermediate between those for which the scales are constructed.
                    William Speer was supervisor and chief assayer of spirits in the port of Dublin.
                    For a more complete account of this instrument see Tilloch’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phil. Mag.,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 151.</p>
                <p>The hydrometer constructed by Mr Jones of Holborn, consists of a spheroidal bulb
                    with a rectangular stem (fig. 6). Between the bulb and counterpoise is placed a
                    thermometer, which serves to indicate the temperature of the liquid, and the
                    instrument is provided with three weights which can be attached to the top of
                    the stem. On the four sides of the stem AD are engraved four scales
                    corresponding respectively to the unloaded instrument, and to the instrument
                    loaded with the respective weights. The instrument when unloaded serves for the
                    range from 74 to 47 above proof; when loaded with the first weight it indicates
                    from 46 to 13 over proof, with the second weight from 13 over proof to 29 under
                    proof, and with the third from 29 under proof to pure water, the graduation
                    corresponding to which is marked W at the bottom of the fourth scale. One side
                    of the stem AD is shown in fig. 6, the other three in fig. 7. The thermometer is
                    also provided with four scales corresponding to the scales above mentioned. Each
                    scale has its zero in the middle corresponding to 60° F. If the mercury in the
                    thermometer stand above this zero the spirit must be reckoned weaker than the
                    hydrometer indicates by the number on the thermometer scale level with the top
                    of the mercury, while if the thermometer indicate a tem-</p>

                <p>with the ten divisions on the stem, form a scale from 0 to 370. The employment of
                    so many weights renders the instrument ill-adapted for practical work where
                    speed is an object. It was adopted for the United States revenue by Act of
                    Congress, August 10, 1790.</p>
                <p>Quin’s universal hydrometer is described in the <hi rend="italic"

                    p. 98. It is provided with a sliding rule to adapt it to different temperatures,
                    and has four scales, one of which is graduated for spirits and the other three
                    serve to show the strengths of worts. The peculiarity of the instrument consists
                    in the pyramidal form given to the stem, which renders the scale-divisions more
                    nearly equal in length than they would be on a prismatic stem.</p>
                <p>Atkins’s hydrometer, as originally constructed, is described in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nicholson s J</hi><hi rend="italic">ournal,</hi> 8vo, vol. ii. p. 276. It
                    is made of brass, and is provided with a spheroidal bulb whose axis is 2 inches
                    in length, the conjugate diameter being 1⅛ inches. The whole length of the
                    instrument is 8 inches, the stem square of about I inch side, and the weight
                    about 400 grains. It is provided with four weights, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and
                    weighing respectively 20, 40, 61, and 84 grains, which can be attached to the
                    shank of the instrument at C (fig. 8), and retained there by the fixed weight B.
                    The scale engraved upon one face of the stem contains fifty-five divisions, the
                    top and bottom being marked 0 or zero, and the alternate intermediate divisions
                    (of which there are twenty-six) being marked with the letters of the alphabet in
                    order. The four weights are so adjusted that, if the instrument floats with the
                    stem emerging as far as the lower division 0 with one of the weights attached,
                    then replacing the weight by the next heavier causes the instrument to sink
                    through the whole length of the scale to the upper division 0, and the first
                    weight produces the same effect when applied to the naked instrument. The stem
                    is thus virtually extended to five times its length, and the number of divisions
                    increased practically to 272. When no weight is attached the instrument
                    indicates densities from ’ 806 to ’ 843; with No. 1 it registers from ’ 843 to
                        <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 880, with No. 2 from '880 to '918, with No. 3
                    from ∙918 to ’ 958, and with No. 4 from 958 to 1Ό00, the temperature being 55’F.
                    It will thus be seen that the whole length of the stem corresponds to a
                    difference ot density of about ’ 04, and one division to about •00074,
                    indicating a difference of little more than ⅜ per cent in the strength of any
                    sample of spirits.</p>
                <p>The instrument is provided with a sliding rule, with scales corresponding to the
                    several weights, which indicate the specific gravity corresponding to the
                    several divisions of the hydrometer scale compared with water at 55° F. The
                    slider upon the nιle serves to adjust the scale for different temperatures, and
                    then indicates the strength of the spirit in percentages over or under proof.
                    The slider is also provided with scales, marked respectively Dicas and Clarke,
                    which serve to show the readings which would have been obtained had the
                    instruments of those makers been employed. The line on the scale marked
                    “concentration” indicates the diminution in volume consequent upon reducing the
                    sample to proof strength (if it is O. P.) or upon reducing proof spirit to the
                    strength of the sample (if <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n555/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0555-0540"/> it is U. P.). By applying the several weights
                    in succession in addition to No. 4, the instrument can be employed for liquids
                    heavier than water; and graduations on the other three sides of the stem,
                    together with an additional slide rule, adapt the instrument for the
                    determination of the strength of worts.</p>
                <p>Mr Atkins subsequently modified the instrument <hi rend="italic">{Nicholson's
                        Journal,</hi> 8vo, vol. iii. p. 50) by constructing the different weights of
                    different shapes, viz., circular, square, triangular, and pentagonal, instead of
                    numbering them 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, a figure of the weight being stamped
                    on the sliding rule opposite to every letter in the series to which it belongs,
                    thus diminishing the probability of mistakes. He also replaced the letters on
                    the stem by the corresponding specific gravities referred to water as unity.
                    Further information concerning these instruments and the state of hydrometry in
                    1803 will be found in Mr Atkins’s pamphlet <hi rend="italic">On the Relation
                        between the Specific Gravities and the Strength of Spirituous Liquors,</hi>

                <p>In Gay Lussac’s alcoholometer the scale is divided into 100 parts corresponding
                    to the presence of 1, 2, . . . per cent, by volume of alcohol at 15°C., the
                    highest division of the scale corresponding to the purest alcohol he could
                    obtain (density <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7947) and the lowest division
                    corresponding to pure water. A table provides the necessary corrections for
                    other temperatures.</p>

                <p>In Beck’s hydrometer the zero of the scale corresponds to density 1000 and the
                    division 30 to density ’ 850, and equal divisions on the scale are continued as
                    far as is required in both directions. The following table serves to indicate
                    the relation between the degrees and the corresponding densities :—</p>

                <p>In the centesimal hydrometer of Μ. Francoeur the volume of the stem between
                    successive divisions of the scale is always <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅞- <hi
                        rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of the whole volume immersed when the instrument
                    floats in water at 4° C. In order to graduate the stem the instrument is first
                    weighed, then immersed in distilled water at 4° C., and the line of flotation
                    marked zero. The first degree is then found by placing on the top of the stem a
                    weight equal to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th
                    of the weight of the instrument, which increases the volume immersed by τ⅛ <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 3</hi> th of the original volume. The addition to the top
                    of the stem of successive weights, each ι⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th of
                    the weight of the instrument itself, serves to determine the successive degrees.
                    The length of 100 divisions of the scale, or the length of the uniform stem the
                    volume of which would be equal to that of the hydrometer up to the zero
                    graduation, Francoeur called the “modulus” of the hydrometer. He constructed his
                    instruments of glass, using different instruments for different portions of the
                    scale (Francoeur, <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >d'areometrie,</hi> Paris, 1842).</p>
                <p>Dr Boriés of Montpellier constructed an hydrometer which was based upon the
                    results of his experiments on mixtures of alcohol and water. The interval
                    between the points corresponding to pure alcohol and to pure water Boriés
                    divided into 100 equal parts, though the stem was prolonged so as to contain
                    only 10 of these divisions, the other 90 being provided for by the addition of 9
                    weights to the bottom of the instrument as in Clarke’s hydrometer.</p>
                <p>Sikes’s hydrometer, on account of its similarity to that of Boriés, appears to
                    have been borrowed from that instrument. It is made of brass, and consists of a
                    spherical ball A (fig. 9), 1 <hi rend="italic">5</hi> inches in diameter, below
                    which is a weight B connected with the ball by a short conical stem C. The stem
                    D is rectangular in section, and about 3⅜ inches in length. This is divided into
                    ten equal parts, each of which is subdivided into five. As in Boriés’s
                    instrument, a series of 9 weights, each of the form shown at E, serves to extend
                    the scale to 100 principal divisions. In the centre of each weight is a hole
                    capable of admitting the lowest and thickest end of the conical stem C, and a
                    slot is cut into it just wide enough to allow the upper part of the cone to
                    pass. Each weight can thus be dropped on to the lower stem so as to rest on the
                    counterpoise B. The weights are marked 10, 20, . . . .90; and in using the
                    instrument that weight must be selected which will allow it to float in the
                    liquid with a portion only of the stern submerged. Then the reading of the scale
                    at the line of flotation, added to the number on the weight, gives the reading
                    required. A small supernumerary weight F is added, which can be placed upon the
                    top of the stem. F is so adjusted that when the 60 wèight is placed on the lower
                    stem the instrument sinks to the same point in distilled water when F is
                    attached as in proof spirit when F is removed.</p>

                <p>In the above table for Sikes’s hydrometer two densities are given corresponding
                    to each of the degrees 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90, indicating that the
                    successive weights belonging to the particular instrument for which the table
                    has been calculated do not quite agree. The discrepancy, however, does not
                    produce any sensible error in the strength of the corresponding spirit.</p>
                <p>A table which indicates the weight per gallon of spirituous liquors for every
                    degree of Sikes’s hydrometer is printed in 23 and 24 Vict. c. 114, schedule B.
                    This table differs slightly from that given above, which has been abridged from
                    the table given in Keene’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook of Hydrometry,</hi>
                    apparently from the equal divisions on Sikes’s scale having been taken as
                    corresponding to equal increments of density.</p>
                <p>Sikes’s hydrometer was established for the purpose of collecting the revenue of
                    the United Kingdom by Act of Parliament, 56 Geo. III. c. 140, by which it was
                    enacted that “all spirits shall be deemed and taken to be of the degree of
                    strength which the said hydrometers called Sikes’s hydrometers shall, upon trial
                    by any officer or officers of the customs or excise, denote such spirits to be.”
                    This Act came into force on January 5,1817, and was to have remained in force
                    until August 1, 1818, but was repealed by 58 Geo. III. c. 28, which established
                    Sikes’s hydrometer on a permanent footing. By 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 52, § 123, it
                    was further enacted that the same instruments and methods should be employed in
                    determining the duty upon imported spirits as should in virtue of any Act of
                    Parliament be employed in the determination of the duty upon spirits distilled
                    at home. It is the practice of the officers of the inland revenue to adjust
                    Sikes’s hydrometer at 62° F., that being the temperature at which the imperial
                    gallon is defined as containing 10 ft avoirdupois of distilled water. The
                    specific gravity of any sample of spirits thus determined, when multiplied by
                    ten, gives the weight in pounds per imperial gallon, and the weight of any bulk
                    of spirits divided by this number gives its volume at once in imperial
                    gallons.</p>
                <p>Mr J. B. Keene of the Hydrometer Office, London, has constructed an instrument
                    after the model of Sikes’s, but provided with twelve weights of different masses
                    but equal volumes, and the instrument is never used without having one of these
                    attached. When loaded with either of the lightest two weights the instrument is
                    specifically lighter than Sikes’s hydrometer when unloaded, and it may thus be
                    used for specific gravities as low as that of absolute alcohol. The volume of
                    each weight being the same, the whole volume immersed is always the same when it
                    floats at the same mark whatever weight may be attached.</p>
                <p>Besides the above, many hydrometers have been employed for special purposes.
                    TwaddelΓs hydrometer is adapted for densities greater than that of water. The
                    scale is so arranged that the reading multiplied by 5 and added to 1000 gives
                    the specific gravity with reference to water as 1000. To avoid an inconveniently
                    long stem, different instruments are employed for different parts of the scale
                    as mentioned above.</p>
                <p>The lactometer constructed by Dicas of Liverpool is adapted for the determination
                    of the quality of milk. It resembles Sikes’s hydrometer in other respects, but
                    is provided with eight weights. It is also provided with a thermometer and slide
                    rule, to reduce the readings to the standard temperature of 55° F.</p>
                <p>The marine hydrometers, as supplied by the British Government to the royal navy
                    and the merchant marine, are glass instruments with slender stems, and generally
                    serve to indicate specific gravities from 1 ’000 to 1Ό40. Before being issued
                    they are compared with a standard instrument, and their errors determined. They
                    are employed for taking observations of the density of sea-water.</p>
                <p>The salinometer is a hydrometer intended to indicate the strength of the brine in
                    marine boilers in which sea-water is employed. Saunders’s salinometer consists
                    of an hydrometer which floats in a chamber through which the water from the
                    boiler is allowed to flow in a gentle stream, at a temperature of 200° F. The
                    peculiarity of the instrument consists in the stream of water, as it enters the
                    hydrometer chamber, being made to impinge against a disk of metal, by which it
                    is broken into drops, thus liberating the steam, which would otherwise disturb
                    the instrument.</p>
                <p>Say’s stereometer is an instrument for the determination of the volumes, and
                    hence of the densities, of bodies which cannot be conveniently measured by the
                    ordinary hydrometer, as, for example, soluble and porous bodies, powders,
                    &amp;c. The instrument consists of a glass tube PC (fig. 10), of uniform bore,
                    terminating in a cup PE, the mouth of which can be rendered air-tight by the
                    plate of glass E. The substance whose volume is to be determined is placed in
                    the cup PE, and the tube PC is immersed in the vessel of mercury D, until the
                    mercury reaches the mark P. The plate E is then placed on the cup, and the tube
                    PC raised until the surface of the mercury in the tube stands at M, that in the
                    vessel D being at C, and the height MC is measured. Let ⅞ denote this height,
                    and let PM be denoted by <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> Let <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    represent the volume of air in the cup before the body was inserted, <hi

                    height of the mercurial barometer. Then, by Boyle’s law,</p>
                <p>(u - <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic">+ al){h</hi>- ⅛) = (u - <hi

                <p>The volume u may be determined by repeating the experiment when only air is in
                    the cup. In this case <hi rend="italic">υ≈0,</hi> and the equation becomes <hi
