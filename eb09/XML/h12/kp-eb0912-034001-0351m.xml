                <p><label type="entry">HULL, or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kingston-upon-Hull</hi></label>, a municipal and parliamentary borough, and one
                    of the principal seaport towns of England, is, though a county in itself,
                    locally within the East Riding of Yorkshire, situated in 53° 44' N. lat. and 0°
                    10'W. long., on the west side of the Hull, where it discharges into the estuary
                    of the Humber, 20 miles from the German Ocean at Spurn Head. By rail it is 41⅜
                    miles east-south-east of York. Branch lines of the NorthEastern Railway connect
                    it with the principal towns in the East Riding; and by means of the steam ferry
                    across the Humber to New Holland it has communication with the Great Northern
                    and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railways. The town stands on a
                    level plain so low as to render embankments necessary to protect it from
                    inundation, and the flatness of the surrounding country as far as the eye can
                    reach is unbroken by anything that can be properly termed an elevation. The
                    older portion of the town, which is completely enclosed between the docks on the
                    north and west and the Hull and Humber on the east and south, was originally
                    very densely inhabited, and its streets were narrow and irregular, but in this
                    respect it has lately undergone great improvements. The streets in the modern
                    quarter are spacious and regular, and the villas of the wealthier classes occupy
                    the suburbs. A pier fronting the Humber affords a pleasant promenade. To the
                    north of the town there is a public park presented in 1860 by Z. C. Pearson,
                    then mayor of Hull. It is 27 acres in extent, is tastefully laid out, and
                    contains full-sized marble statues of her Majesty the Queen and of the late
                    Prince Consort. A botanic garden about 40 acres in extent was opened in 1880.
                    There is a large public cemetery, which possesses separate chapels for churchmen
                    and dissenters. The town is supplied with water from springs about 4 miles
                    distant, two condensing engines of 60 horse power each being employed in pumping
                    it.</p>
                <p>The principal public buildings are the town-hall in Lowgate, completed in 1866 in
                    the Italian Renaissance style, having a very richly adorned façade, with a
                    central dome 135 feet in height resting on eight arches, and containing a clock
                    and bell; the exchange in the same street, completed also in 1866, in a less
                    ornate form of the Italian style, containing a hall 70 feet long by 40 feet
                    wide, and the offices of the Hull chamber of commerce and the Hull guardian
                    society for the protection of trade; the corn exchange in High Street, a plain
                    building with a great hall 157 feet long by 36 feet wide; the custom-house in
                    Whitefriargate; Trinity House, a handsome brick building in the Tuscan style,
                    erected in 1753 by the guild of Trinity House, originally established in 1369;
                    Charterhouse, rebuilt in 1645, belonging to a foundation for the support “of the
                    feeble and old,” which was established by Sir Michael de la Pole in 1384; the
                    dock offices, an elaborate building in the Italian style; the royal institution,
                    a large and beautiful edifice in the Roman Corinthian style, opened by Prince
                    Albert in 1854, possessing a museum, a library of 40,000 volumes, and
                    accommodation for the meetings of the literary and philosophical society; the
                    new general post office, in the modern Italian style, opened in 1877; the
                    prison, constructed on the new model principle, opened in 1869; the music-hall,
                    in the Renaissance style; the theatre royal, opened in 1873, a stuccoed
                    structure with a handsome Corinthian front; the public baths and washhouses, in
                    the Tudor style, completed in 1850 at a cost of'£12,000. The only church of
                    special interest or architectural merit is that of Holy Trinity, on the west
                    side of the market-place, a cruciform edifice in the floral Gothic style,
                    originally founded at the end of the 13th century, but of various dates, and
                    lately completely restored at a cost of over £30,000, having an extreme length
                    of 272 feet, the breadth of the nave being 72 feet and that of the chancel 70
                    feet. It possesses a very fine west window, filled with stained glass in 1862 at
                    a cost of £1000, and is surmounted at the intersection of the nave and transept
                    by a noble tower, with finely decorated pinnacles, rising from the point of
                    intersection to the height of 140 feet. St Mary’s church in Lowgate, in the
                    Perpendicular style, was originally founded in the beginning of the 14th
                    century, but has been nearly all rebuilt since that period, the tower being
                    erected in 1696, and the whole building restored in 1863-65 at a cost of
                    £10,000. The principal educational establishments are the grammar school,
                    founded in 1486; the Hull and East Riding college, a proprietary school for sons
                    of gentlemen; the Trinity House marine school, founded in 1716; Cogan’s charity
                    school for girls, founded in 1763; national, British, Catholic, Wesleyan, and
                    school board schools; a ragged and industrial school; and the Humber industrial
                    school ship “Southampton.” Among the other institutions for ministering to the
                    intellectual wants of the community are the school of science and art, the
                    literary and philosophical society, the royal institution, the mechanics’
                    institution, the Hull church institute and library, the young people’s Christian
                    and literary institute, the Catholic institute, the Lyceum library and
                    reading-room, and the literary club. The charities and benevolent foundations
                    are numerous, and, in addition to Charterhouse and Trinity House, already
                    mentioned, include the infirmary, founded in 1782, and extended by the addition
                    of two wings in 1840, and of detached fever wards in 1874; the Hull and
                    Sculcoates dispensary, founded in 1814; the <pb break="no"

                    Sculcoates union woιkhouse , the seamen’s and general orphan asylum; the
                    sailors’ home, opened in 1860; the sailors’ orphan home and school, erected in
                    1863; Gregg's hospital, founded in 1416, Lister’s in 1641, and Crowle’s in
                    1661.</p>
                <p>Hull ranks as the third port of the United Kingdom, being surpassed in the value
                    of its exports and imports by London and Liverpool only. The original harbour
                    occupied that part of the river Hull which faced the old town, but in 1774 an
                    Act was passed for forming a dock on the site of the old fortifications, having
                    its entrance at the upper end of the old harbour. This dock, known for some time
                    as the Old dock, is 1703 feet long and 254 feet broad, and its area is 10 acres.
                    In 1809 the Humber dock at the south end of the town was opened; it is 914 feet
                    long and 342 feet broad, and its area is 7 acres. These two docks were connected
                    by a third, opened in 1829, at first named the Junction dock, its length being
                    645 feet and a breadth of 238 feet; its area is 6 acres. After a visit paid to
                    Hull by the Queen and Prince Albert in 1854, the name of the Old dock was
                    changed to the Queen’s dock, and that of the Junction dock to the Prince’s dock.
                    The Railway dock, opened in 1846, extends to 3 acres. In 1850 the Victoria dock
                    was opened, on the east side of the river Hull, with entrances from it and
                    the</p>
                <p>Humber, and occupied an area of about 12 J acres. In 1863 this dock was extended
                    7∣ acres eastward. In connexion with this dock was a timber pond of 9∣ acres,
                    subsequently enlarged to 14 acres, and a new one of 11 acres was about the same
                    date constructed near it. The Albert dock, opened by the prince of Wales in July
                    1869, occupies an area of 24∣ acres, and has a length of 3370 feet, with a
                    breadth at the eastern end of 480 feet, and at the western end of 200 feet. To
                    the west of it an additional dock of 6 acres was opened in May 1880. A capacious
                    graving dock, 460 feet long, which is entered from the last-mentioned dock is
                    now (1880) in course of construction. Another dock of 24 acres, to the west of
                    the new West dock, has been commenced. Rails in connexion with the North-Eastern
                    Rail way are laid along the quays of the docks. In 1880 an Act was obtained for
                    a railway from Hull to Barnsley, and a dock in connexion with it. The shipping
                    trade of Hull is chiefly with the Baltic ports, Denmark, Norway, Germany, and
                    Holland; but it has also regular steam communication with the other principal
                    ports of Europe, as well as with the United States, the Black Sea, Egypt,
                    &amp;c. In 1878 the number of ships that entered was 4996, with a tonnage of
                    1,750,977, and the number that cleared 4802, with a tonnage of 1,788,214. For
                    the five years ending 1878 the average number of ships that entered was 4987,
                    with a tonnage of 1,742,120, while 4857 cleared, with a tonnage of
                    1,726,151.</p>
                <p>The value of imports of foreign and colonial merchandise in 1878 was
                    &lt;£17,849,197, and the average value for the five years 1874-78 was
                    £18,038,263. The value of exports of produce of the United Kingdom in 1878 was
                    £19,109,797, and the average value for the five years was £21,267,391. Hull is
                    one of the principal shipping ports for the manufactures of Yorkshire and
                    Lancashire, and imports large quantities of grain from Russia, Prussia, America,
                    and the British colonies, and of timber from Norway and Sweden. The import of
                    cattle is very large, and a commodious cattle depot has been constructed. The
                    deep-sea fishing is <pb break="no"

                    several small steamers, employs about 450 boats, with 2500 hands. Whale-fishing,
                    once an important industry, is now discontinued.</p>
                <p>The staple industry of Hull is seed-crushing for oil and cake making. It
                    possesses extensive engineering works and foundries, large iron shipbuilding
                    yards, rope-yards, sail-lofts, tanneries, breweries, flax and cotton mills,
                    chemical works, and manufactures of blue and black lead, paints, colours, and
                    varnishes, Portland and Roman cement, phosphate of lime, tobacco, starch, paper,
                    soap, furniture, and organs.</p>
                <p>The population of the parliamentary borough, which was 84,690 in 1851, had in
                    1871 reached 123,408. The population of the municipal borough in 1861 was
                    97,661, and in 1871 it had increased to 121,892. The area of the municipal
                    borough is 3635 acres, and of the parliamentary 4447 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Hull originated in the two nearly contiguous
                    villages of Myton and Wyke, the latter of which was a considerable port not long
                    after the Norman Conquest. For some period the united village was known as
                    Myt.on-Wyke, but even before the reign of Edward I. it is also occasionally
                    mentioned as Hull. In 1298 Edward I., on returning from the battle of Dunbar,
                    happened to pay it a visit, when, struck with its advantages as a commercial
                    port, he purchased it from the abbot of Meaux, with the purpose of fortifying
                    it. He created the town a manor of itself, bestowed upon it the name of
                    Kingston-upon-Hull, and issued a proclamation offering to all who settled in it
                    special advantages. In 1299 it received a royal charter constituting it a free
                    borough. About the same time the improvements on its harbour were completed, and
                    from this period its increase in prosperity was rapid and uninterrupted. In 1316
                    a regular ferry was established between Hull and Barton in Lincolnshire, and a
                    few years later the town was fortified with walls and ditches. Much of the early
                    prosperity of the town was due to the enterprise of the famous merchants, the De
                    la Poles, who were high in favour with successive monarchs, and the head of
                    which house was in 1385 created earl of Suffolk. Such was the importance of the
                    town in the reign of Edward III. that in 1359 it supplied for the armament
                    against France 16 ships and 466 seamen, the quota of London being 25 ships and
                    662 seamen, and that of Newcastle 17 ships and 314 seamen. In the reign of
                    Richard II. the fortresses were repaired and a strong castle was erected on the
                    east side of the river Hull. By Henry VI. additional charters were granted,
                    erecting the town and liberties into a county in itself, under the designation
                    of “The Town and County of the Town of Kingston-upon-Hull,” constituting it a
                    corporate town, and appointing, instead of a mayor and bailiffs, for its
                    government a mayor, sheriff, and aidermen. In the Wars of the Roses it
                    strenuously maintained the cause of Lancaster; and so zealous was it in its
                    loyalty that after the borough funds were exhausted additional money was raised
                    by the sale of the materials of the market cross. In the 15th, 16th, and 17th
                    centuries it suffered greatly from the plague, and in 1527 and 1549 much damage
                    was caused by inundations. During the insurrection in 1536 called the Pilgrimage
                    of Grace, originated by the dissolution of the monasteries, Hull was seized by
                    the insurgents, but, after the dispersion of the main body at Doncaster, the
                    ringleaders in the town were seized by the magistrates and executed. During the
                    second rebellion in Yorkshire in 1537 the town was taken possession of by the
                    insurgents headed by Sir Robert Constable, and held for a month, but the loyal
                    inhabitants, surprising them in the middle of the night, compelled them to
                    surrender; many of them were executed, and the body of Sir Robert Constable was
                    hung in chains over the Beverley gate. In 1540 Hull was visited by Henry VII I.,
                    who, after a careful survey of the town and neighbourhood, gave directions for
                    the erection of a castle and other fortifications, for the cutting of a canal
                    from Newland to Hull in order to provide “additions of fresh water,” and for the
                    improvement of Suffolk palace, originally erected by the De la Poles, but since
                    then acquired by the crown. During the parliamentary war the possession of Hull
                    was an object of ambition to both parties on account of its importance as a
                    dépôt for armsand military stores. In 1642 the governor, Sir John Hotham,
                    refused to admit Charles I. into the town. In 1643 and 1644 it sustained two
                    long sieges and many vigorous attacks by the royalists.</p>
                <p>In 1534 Hull was made the see of a suffragan bishop, but the office was abolished
                    on the death of Edward VI. By the 33d of Edward I. the town returned burgesses
                    to parliament. The privilege was afterwards for some time in abeyance till the
                    12th of Edward II., since which period it has returned two members.</p>
                <p>Among the eminent natives of Hull, besides the De la Poles, are Andrew Marvell,
