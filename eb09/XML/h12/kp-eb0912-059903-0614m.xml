                    perennial plant about 2 feet high, with slender, quadrangular, woody stems;
                    narrowly elliptical, pointed, entire, dotted leaves, about 1 inch long and ⅜
                    inch wide, growing in pairs on the stem; and long terminal, erect,
                    half-verticillate, leafy spikes of small violetblue flowers, which are in
                    blossom from June to September. Two varieties of the plant occur in gardens, one
                    having variegated leaves and the other reddish flowers. The <pb break="no"

                    are believed to owe their properties to a volatile oil which is present in the
                    proportion of ⅜ to ⅜ per cent. Hyssop is a native of the south of Europe, its
                    range extending eastward to Siberia; it was introduced into England by Gerard in
                    the year 1596. A strong tea made of the leaves, and sweetened with honey, was
                    formerly used in pulmonary and catarrhal affections, and externally as an
                    application to bruises and indolent swellings.</p>
                <p>The Hedge Hyssop <hi rend="italic">(Gratiola officinalis)</hi> belongs to the
                    natural order <hi rend="italic">Scrophulariaceoe,</hi> and is a native of marshy
                    lands in the south of Europe, whence it was introduced into Britain nearly 300
                    years ago. Like <hi rend="italic">Hyssopus officinalis,</hi> it has smooth
                    opposite entire leaves, but the stems are cylindrical, the leaves twice the
                    size, and the flowers solitary in the axils of the leaves and having a
                    yellowish-red veined tube and bluish-white limb,' while the capsules are oval
                    and many-seeded. The herb has a bitter, nauseous taste, but is almost odourless.
                    In small quantities it acts as a purgative, diuretic, and emetic when taken
                    internally. It was formerly official in the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia, being
                    esteemed as a remedy for dropsical and scrofulous affections. It has also been
                    given in the form of wine for hypochondriasis. It is said to have formed the
                    basis of a celebrated nostrum for gout, called <hi rend="italic">Hau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">médicinale,</hi> and in former times was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gratia Dei,</hi> on account of its medicinal properties. When growing in
                    abundance, as it does in some damp pastures in Switzerland, it becomes dangerous
                    to cattle. <hi rend="italic">G. peruviana</hi> is known to possess similar
                    properties.</p>
                <p>The hyssop (’ esoδ) of Scripture (Ex. xii. 22; Lev. xiv. 4, 6; Numb. xix. 6, 18;
                    1 Kings v. 13 (iv. 33); Ps. li. 9 (7); John xix. 29), a wall-growing plant
                    adapted for sprinkling purposes, has long been the subject of learned
                    disputation, the only point on which all have agreed being that it is not to be
                    identified with the <hi rend="italic">Hyssopus officinalis,</hi> which is not a
                    native of Palestine. No less than eighteen plants have been supposed by various
                    authors to answer the conditions, and Celsius has devoted more than forty pages
                    to the discussion of their several claims. By Tristram <hi rend="italic">{Oxford
                    Bible for Teachers,</hi> 1880) and others the caper plant <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Capparis</hi><hi rend="italic">spinosa)</hi> is supposed to be meant; but,
                    apart from other difficulties, this identification is open to the objection that
                    the caper seems to be, at least in one passage (Eccl. xii. 5), otherwise
                    designated <hi rend="italic">{'abiy-y6nah).</hi> Thenius (on 1 Kings v. 13)
                    suggests <hi rend="italic">Orthotrichum</hi><hi rend="italic">saxatile.</hi> The
                    most probable opinion would seem to be that found in Maimonides and many later
                    writers, according to which the Hebrew ’ <hi rend="italic">ezob</hi> is to be
                    identified with the Arabic <hi rend="italic">sdatar,</hi> now understood to be
                    <hi rend="italic">Satureja</hi><hi rend="italic">Thymus,</hi> a plant of very
                    frequent occurrence in Syria and Palestine, with which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thymus</hi><hi rend="italic">Serpyllum,</hi> or Wild Thyme, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Satureja Thymbra</hi> are closely allied. Its smell, taste, and
                    medicinal properties are similar to those of <hi rend="italic">H.
                    officinalis.</hi> In Morocco the <hi rend="italic">saatar</hi> of the Arabs is
                    <hi rend="italic">Origanum compactum,</hi> Ben th.; and it appears probable, as
                    suggested by Mr W. Carruthers, that several plants of the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Thymus, Origanum,</hi> and others nearly allied in form and habit,
                    and found in similar localities, were used under the name of hyssop.</p>
