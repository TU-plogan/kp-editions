                    rend="smallcaps">Heinrich Alexander, Baron von</hi> (1769-1859), a distinguished
                    naturalist and traveller, was born at Berlin, September 14, 1769. His father,
                    who was a major in the Prussian army, belonged to a Pomeranian family of
                    consideration, and was rewarded for his services during the Seven Years’ War
                    with the post of royal chamberlain. He married in 1766 Maria Elizabeth von
                    Colomb, widow of Baron von Hollwede, and had by her two sons, of whom the
                    younger is the subject of this notice. The childhood of Alexander von Humboldt
                    was not a promising one, as regards either health or intellect. His
                    characteristic tιstes, however, soon displayed themselves; and from his fancy
                    for collecting and labelling plants, shells, and insects he received the playful
                    title of “the little apothecary.” The care of his education, on the unexpected
                    death of his father in 1779, devolved upon his mother, who discharged the trust
                    with constancy and judgment. Destined for a political career, he studied finance
                    during six months at the university of Frankfort-on-the-Oder; and a year later,
                    April 25, 1789, he matriculated at Göttingen, then eminent for the lectures of
                    Heyne and Blumenbach. His vast and varied powers were by this time fully
                    developed; and during the vacation of 1789 he gave a fair earnest of his future
                    performances in a scientific excursion up the Rhine, and in the treatise thence
                    issuing, <hi rend="italic">Mineralogische Beobachtungen über einige Basalte am
                    lihein</hi> (Brunswick, 1790). His native passion for distant travel was
                    confirmed by the friendship formed by him at Göttingen with George Forster,
                    Heyne’s son-in-law, the distinguished companion of Cook’s second voyage.
                    Henceforth his studies, which his rare combination of parts enabled him to
                    render at once multifarious, rapid, and profound, were directed with
                    extraordinary insight and perseverance to the purpose of preparing himself for
                    his distinctive calling as a scientific explorer. With this view he studied
                    commerce and foreign languages at Hamburg, geology at Freiberg under Werner,
                    anatomy at Jena under Loder, astronomy and the use of scientific instruments
                    under Zach and Köhler. His researches into the vegetation of the mines of
                    Freiberg led to the publication in 1793 of his <hi rend="italic">Florae
                    Fribergensis Specimen·,</hi> and the results of a prolonged course of
                    experiments on the phenomena of muscular irritability, then recently discovered
                    by Galvani, were contained in his <hi rend="italic">Versuche über</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">gereizte Muskel-und Nervenfaser</hi>
                    (Berlin, 1797), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.</p>
                <p>In 1794 he was admitted to the intimacy of the famous Weimar coterie, and
                    contributed (June 1795) to Schiller’s new periodical, <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Horen,</hi> a philosophical allegory entitled <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lebenskraft, oder der</hi><hi rend="italic">rhodische Genius.</hi>
                    In the summer of 1790 he paid a flying visit to England in company with Forster.
                    In 1792 and 1797 he was in Vienna; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical
                    tour through Switzerland and Italy. He had obtained in the me intime official
                    employment, having been appointed assessor of mines at Berlin, February 29,
                    1792. Although the service of the state was consistently regarded by him but as
                    an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such
                    conspicuous ability that he not only rapidly rose to the highest post in his
                    department,but was besides entrusted with several important diplomatic missions.
                    The death of his mother, November 19, 1796, set him free to follow the bent of
                    his genius, and, finally severing his official connexions, he waited for an
                    opportunity of executing his long-cherished schemes of travel. On the
                    postponement of Captain Baudin’s proposed voyage of circumnavigation, which he
                    had been officially invited to accompany, he left Γaris for Marseilles with
                    Bonpland, the designated botanist of the frustrated expedition, hoping to join
                    Bonaparte in Egypt. The means of transport, however, were not forthcoming, and
                    the two travellers eventually found their way to Madrid, where the unexpected
                    patronage of the minister d’Urquijo determined them to make Spanish America the
                    scene of their explorations.</p>
                <p>Armed with powerful recommendations, they sailed in the “Pizarro” from Corunna,
                    June 5, 1799, stopped six days at Teneriffe for the ascent of the Peak, and
                    landed, July 16, at Cumana. There Humboldt observed, on the night of the 12-13th
                    of November, that remarkable meteorshower which forms the starting-point of our
                    acquaintance with the periodicity of the phenomenon; thence he proceeded with
                    Bonpland to Caracas; and in February 1800 he left the coast for the purpose of
                    exploring the course of the Orinoco. This trip, which lasted four months, and
                    covered 1725 miles of wild and uninhabited country, had the important result of
                    establishing the existence of a communication between the water-systems of the
                    Orinoco and Amazon, and of determining the exact position of the bifurcation. On
                    the 24th of November the two friends set sail for Cuba, and after a stay of some
                    months regained the mainland at Cartagena. Ascendingthe swollen stream of the
                    Magdalena, and crossing the frozen ridgesof the Cordilleras, they reached <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0355-0344"/> Quito after a tedious and difficult journey,
                    January 6,1802. Their stay there was signalized by the ascent of Pichincha and
                    Chimborazo, and terminated in an expedition to the sources of the Amazon <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">route</hi> for Lima. At Callao Humboldt
                    observed the transit of Mercury on November 9, and studied the fertilizing
                    properties of guano, the introduction of which into Europe was mainly due to his
                    writings. A tempestuous sea-voyage brought them to the shores of Mexico, and
                    after a year’s residence in that province, followed by a short visit to the
                    United States, they set sail for Europe from the mouth of the Delaware, and
                    landed at Bordeaux, August 3, 1804.</p>
                <p>Humboldt may justly be regarded as having in this memorable expedition laid the
                    foundation of the sciences of physical geography and meteorology in their larger
                    bearings. By his delineation (in 1817) of “isothermal lines,” he at once
                    suggested the idea and devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of
                    various countries. He first investigated the rate of decrease in mean
                    temperature with increase of elevation above the sea-level, and afforded, by his
                    investigations into the origin of tropical storms, the earliest clue to the
                    detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in
                    higher latitudes; while his essay on the geography of plants was based on the
                    then novel idea of studying the distribution of organic life as affected by
                    varying physical conditions. His discovery of the decrease in intensity of the
                    earth’s magnetic force from the poles to the equator was communicated to the
                    Paris Institute in a memoir read by him, December 7, 1804, and its importance
                    was attested by the speedy emergence of rival claims. His services to geology
                    were mainly based on his attentive study of the volcanoes of the New World. He
                    showed that they fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding
                    with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the igneous origin
                    of rocks hitherto held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the
                    spread of juster views than those then prevailing.</p>
                <p>The reduction into form and publication of the encyclopaedic mass of
                    materials—scientific, political, and archaeological—collected by him during his
                    absence from Europe was now Humboldt’s most urgent desire. After a short trip to
                    Italy with Gay-Lussac for the purpose of investigating the law of magnetic
                    declination, and a sojourn of two years and a half in his native city, he
                    finally, in the spring of 1808, settled in Paris with the view of securing the
                    scientific co-operation required for bringing his great work through the press.
                    This colossal task, which he at first hoped would have occupied but two years,
                    eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then remained incomplete. With the
                    exception of Napoleon Bonaparte, he was now the most famous man in Europe. A
                    chorus of applause greeted him from every side. Academies, both native and
                    foreign, were eager to enrol him among their members. Frederick William III. of
                    Prussia conferred upon him the honour, without exacting the duties, attached to
                    the post of royal chamberlain, together with a pension of 2500 thalers,
                    afterwards doubled. He refused the appointment of Prussian minister of public
                    instruction in 1810. In 1814 he accompanied the allied sovereigns to London.
                    Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the
                    congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same
                    monarch to the congress of Verona, proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome
                    and Naples, and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823.</p>
                <p>The French capital he had long regarded as his true home. There he found, not
                    only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy
                    mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">salons</hi> and as the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> of the
                    institute and the-observatory. Thus, when at last he received from his·
                    sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed indeed, but with deep
                    and lasting ’ regret. The provincialism of his native city was odious to him. He
                    never ceased to rail against the bigotry without religion, aesthe-ticism without
                    culture, and philosophy without common sense, which he found dominant on the
                    banks of the Spree. The unremitting benefits and sincere attachment of two
                    well-meaning princes secured indeed his gratitude, but could not appease his
                    discontent. At first he sought relief from the “nebulous atmosphere” of his new
                    abode by frequent visits to Paris; but as years advanced his excursions were
                    reduced to accompanying the monotonous “oscillations” of the court between
                    Potsdam and Berlin. On the 12th of May 1827 he settled permanently in
                    the-Prussian capital, where his first efforts were directed towards the
                    furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. For many years it had been
                    one of his favourite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at
                    distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of “magnetic
                    storms ”—a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of the
                    earth’s magnetism. The meeting at Berlin, September 18, 1828, of a newly-formed
                    scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the
                    opportunity of setting on foot an extensive-system of research in combination
                    with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian Government in
                    1829 led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations
                    across northern Asia; while his letter to the duke of Sussex, then (April 1836)
                    president of the Royal Society, secured for the undertaking the wide· basis of
                    the British dominions. Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one
                    of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first
                    successfully organized.</p>
                <p>In 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to
                    Humboldt, first by the Russian, and afterwards by the Prussian Government; but
                    on each occasion untoward circumstances interposed, and it was not until he had
                    entered upon his sixtieth year that he resumed his early <hi rend="italic"
                    >role</hi> of a traveller in the interests of science. Between May and November
                    1829 he, together with his chosen associates Gustav Rose and Ehrenberg,
                    traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the Neva to the Yenesei,
                    accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of 9614 miles. The journey,
                    however, though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate
                    patronage of the Russian Government, was too rapid to be profitable. Its most
                    important fruits were the correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of
                    the height of the Central-Asian plateau, and the discovery of diamonds in the
                    gold-washings of the Ural—a result which Humboldt’s Brazilian experiences
                    enabled him to predict, and by predicting to secure.</p>
                <p>Between 1830 and 1848 Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to
                    the court of Louis Philippe, with whom he always maintained the most cordial
                    personal relations. The death of his brother, Wilhelm von Humboldt, who expired
                    in his arms, April 8, 1836, saddened the later years of his life. In losing him,
                    Alexander lamented that he had “lost *half himself.” The accession of the crown
                    prince as Frederick William IV., on the death of his father, in June 1840, added
                    to rather than detracted from his court favour. Indeed, the new king’s craving
                    for his society became at times so importunate as to leave him only some hours
                    snatched from sleep for the prosecution of his literary labours.</p>
                <p>It is not often that a man postpones to his seventy-sixth year, and then
                    successfully executes, the crowning task of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n356/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0356-0345"/> his life. Yet this was Humboldt’s case. The first
                    two volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> were published, and in the main
                    composed, between the years 1845 and 1847. The idea of a work which should
                    convey, not only a graphic description, but an imaginative conception of the
                    physical world—which should support generalization by details, and dignify
                    details by generalization, had floated before his mind for upwards of half a
                    century. It first took definite shape in a set of lectures delivered by him
                    before the university of Berlin in the winter of 1827-28. These lectures formed,
                    as his latest biographer expresses it, “the cartoon for the great fresco of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kosmos.”</hi> The scope of this remarkable work may be briefly
                    described as the representation of the unity amid the complexity of nature. In
                    it the large and vague ideals of the 18th are sought to be combined with the
                    exact scientific requirements of the 19th century. And, in spite of inevitable
                    shortcomings, the attempt was in an eminent degree successful. Nevertheless, the
                    general effect of the book is rendered to some extent unsatisfactory by its
                    tendency to substitute the indefinite for the infinite, and thus to ignore,
                    while it does not deny, the existence of a power outside and beyond those of
                    nature. A certain heaviness of style, too, and laborious picturesqueness of
                    treatment make it more imposing than attractive to the general reader. Its
                    supreme and abiding value, however, consists in its faithful reflexion of the
                    mind of a great man. No higher eulogium can be passed on Alexander von Humboldt
                    than that, in attempting, and not unworthily attempting, to portray the
                    universe, he succeeded still more perfectly in portraying his own comprehensive
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>The last decade of his long life—his “improbable” years, as he was accustomed to
                    call them—was devoted to the continuation of this work, of which the third and
                    fourth volumes were published in 1850-58, and a fragment of a fifth appeared
                    posthumously in 1862. In these he sought to fill up what was wanting of detail
                    as to individual branches of science in the sweeping survey contained in the
                    first volume. Notwithstanding their high separate value, it must be admitted
                    that, from an artistic point of view, these additions were deformities. The
                    characteristic idea of the work, so far as such a gigantic idea admitted of
                    literary incorporation, was completely developed in its opening portions, and
                    the attempt to convert it into a scientific encyclopaedia was in truth to
                    nullify its generating motive. Humboldt’s remarkable industry and accuracy were
                    never more conspicuous than in the erection of this latest trophy to his genius.
                    Nor did he rely entirely on his own labours. He owed much of what he
                    accomplished to his rare power of assimilating the thoughts aud availing himself
                    of the co-operation of others. He was not more ready to incur than to
                    acknowledge obligations. The notes to <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> overflow
                    with laudatory citations, which were, indeed, the current coin in which he
                    discharged his intellectual debts.</p>
                <p>On the 24th of February 1857 Humboldt was attacked with a slight apoplectic
                    stroke, which, however, passed away without leaving any perceptible trace. It
                    was not until the winter of 1858-59 that his strength began to decline, and on
                    the ensuing 6th of May he tranquilly expired, wanting but six months of
                    completing his ninetieth year. The honours which had been showered on him during
                    life followed him after death. His remains, previously to being interred in the
                    family resting-place at Tegel, were conveyed in state through the streets of
                    Berlin, and received by the prince-regent with uncovered head at the door of the
                    cathedral. The first centenary of his birth was celebrated September 14, 1869,
                    with equal enthusiasm in the New as in the Old World; and the numerous monuments
                    erected in his honour, and newly-explored regions called by his name, bear
                    witness to the universal diffusion of his fame and popularity.</p>
                <p>Humboldt was never married, and seems to have been at all times more social than
                    domestic in his tastes. To bis brother’s family he was, however, much attached;
                    and in his later years the somewhat arbitrary sway of an old aud faithful
                    servant held him in more than matrimonial bondage. By a singular example of
                    weakness, he executed, four years before his death, a deed of gift transferring
                    to this man Seifert the absolute possession of his entire property. It is right
                    to add that no undue advantage appears to have been taken of this extraordinary
                    concession. Of the qualities of his heart it is less easy to speak than of those
                    of his head. The clue to his inner life might probably be found in a certain
                    egotism of self-culture which influenced his affections as well as regulated his
                    studies. His attachments, however, once formed, were sincere and lasting. He
                    made innumerable friends; and it does not stand on record that he ever lost one.
                    His benevolence was throughout his life active and disinterested. His early zeal
                    for the improvement of the condition of the miners in Galicia and Franconia, his
                    consistent detestation of slavery, his earnest patronage of rising men of
                    science, bear witness to the large humanity which formed the ground-work of his
                    character. The faults of his old age have been brought into undue prominence by
                    the injudicious publication of his letters to Varnhagen von Ense. The chief of
                    these was his habit of smooth speaking, almost amounting to flattery, which
                    formed a painful contrast with the caustic sarcasm of his confidential
                    utterances. His vanity, at all times conspicuous, was tempered by his sense of
                    humour, and was so frankly avowed as to invite sympathy rather than provoke
                    ridicule. After every deduction has been made, he yet stands before us as a
                    colossal figure, not unworthy to take his place beside Goethe as the
                    representative of the scientific side of the culture of his country.</p>
                <p>The best biography of Humboldt is that of Professor Karl Bruhns (3 vols., 8vo,
                    Leipsic, 1872), excellently translated into English by the Misses Lassell, with
                    the omission, however, of the exhaustive bibliographical notice and scientific
                    summary contained in the original. The <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi

                    Tübingen, 1808) went through three editions in his lifetime, and was translated
                    into nearly every European language. The results of his Asiatic journey were
                    published in <hi rend="italic">Fragments</hi><hi rend="italic">de géologie et de
                    climatologie asiatiques,</hi> (2 vols. 8vo, 1831), and in <hi rend="italic">Asie
                    centrale</hi> (3 vols. 8vo, 1843)—an enlargement of the earlier work. The
                    memoirs and papers read by him before scientific societies, or contributed by
                    him to scientific periodicals, are too numerous for specification.</p>
                <p>Since his death considerable portions of his correspondence have been made
                    public. The first of these, in order both of time and of importance, is his <hi

                    1860. This was followed in rapid succession by <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel
