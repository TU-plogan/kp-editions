                    8th of August 1694. His birthplace was probably the townland of Drumalig, in the
                    parish of Saintfield and county of Down, Ireland.<note anchored="true"

                    for August 1813.</p></note> Though the family had sprung from Ayrshire in
                    Scotland, both his father and grandfather were ministers of dissenting
                    congregations in the north of Ireland. Young Hutcheson was educated partly by
                    his grandfather, partly at au academy, where he is stated by his biographer, Dr
                    Leechman, to have been taught “the ordinary scholastic philosophy which was in
                    vogue in those days.” In the year 1710, at the age of sixteen, he entered the
                    university of Glasgow, where he spent the next six years of his life, at first
                    in the study of philosophy, classics, and general literature, and afterwards in
                    the study of theology. On quitting the university, he returned to the north of
                    Ireland, received a licence to preach, and was just on the point of settling
                    down as the minister of a small dissenting congregation, when it was suggested
                    to him by some gentlemen living in the neighbourhood of Dublin to start a
                    private academy in that city. At Dublin his literary accomplishments soon made
                    him generally known, and he appears to have rapidly formed the acquaintance of
                    the more notable persons, lay and ecclesiastical, who then resided in the
                    metropolis of Ireland. Among these is specially to be noted Archbishop King,
                    author of the well-known work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">Mali,</hi> who, to his great honour, steadily
                    resisted all attempts to prosecute Hutcheson in the archbishop’s court for
                    keeping a school without having previously subscribed to the ecclesiastical
                    canons and obtained the episcopal licence. Hutcheson’s relations with the clergy
                    of the Established Church, especially with the archbishops of Armagh and Dublin,
                    Boulter and King, seem to have been of the most cordial description; and “the
                    inclination of his friends to serve him, the schemes proposed to him for
                    obtaining promotion,” &amp;c., of which his biographer speaks, probably refer to
                    some offers of preferment, on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination.
                    These offers, however, of whatever nature they might be, were unavailing;
                    “neither the love of riches nor of the elegance and grandeur of human life
                    prevailed so far in his breast as to make him offer the least violence to his
                    inward sentiments.”</p>
                <p>While residing in Dublin, Hutcheson published anonymously the four essays by
                    which he still remains best known, namely, the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry
                    concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, Design,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi> in 1725, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrations upon the Moral Sense,</hi> in 1728. The original
                    title of the former work (which reached a second edition in the next year) was—
                    <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue
                    in two Treatises, in which the Principles of the late Earl of Shaftesbury are
                    explained and defended against the Author of the Fable of the Bees; and the
                    Ideas of Moral Good and Evil are established, according to the Sentiments of the
                    Ancient Moralists, with an attempt to introduce a Mathematical Calculation on
                    subjects of Morality.</hi> The alterations and additions made in the second
                    edition of these <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> were published in a separate form
                    in 1726. To the period of his Dublin residence are also to be referred the
                    “Thoughts on Laughter” (a criticism of Hobbes) and the “Observations on the
                    Fable of the Bees,” being in all six letters contributed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hibernicus</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> a periodical which appeared
                    in Dublin, 1725-27 (2d ed,, 1734). At the end of the same period occurred the
                    controversy in the columns of the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> with Mr
                    Gilbert Burnet (probably the second son of Dr Gilbert Burnet, bishop of
                    Salisbury), on the “True Foundation of Virtue or Moral Goodness.” All these
                    letters were collected in one volume, and published by Foulis, Glasgow,
                    1772.</p>
                <p>In 1729 Hutcheson was elected as the successor of his old master, Gerschom
                    Carmichael, to the chair of moral philosophy in the university of Glasgow. It is
                    curious that up to this time both his essays and letters had all been published
                    anonymously, though their authorship appears to have been perfectly well known.
                    In 1730 he entered on the duties of his office, delivering an inaugural lecture
                    (afterwards published), <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturali
                    Hominum Socialitate.</hi> The prospect of being delivered from the miscellaneous
                    drudgery of school work, and of securing increased leisure for the pursuit of
                    his favourite studies, occasions an almost boisterous outburst of joy
                    :—“laboriosissimis, mihi, atque molestissimis negotiis implicito, exigua admodum
                    erant ad bonas literas aut mentem colendam otia; non levi igitur laetitia
                    commovebar cum almam matrem Academiam me, suum olim alumnum, in libertatem
                    asseruisse audiveram.” And yet the works on which Hutcheson’s reputation was to
                    rest had already been published.</p>
                <p>The rest of Hutcheson’s life, down to his death in 1746, was mainly spent in the
                    assiduous performance of the duties of his professorship, including, of course,
                    the preparation of lectures for his classes. His reputation as a teacher
                    attracted many young men, belonging to dissenting families, from England and
                    Ireland, and he appears to have enjoyed a well-deserved popularity among both
                    his pupils and his colleagues. Though somewhat quick-tempered, he was remarkable
                    for his warm feelings and generous impulses. “He was all benevolence and
                    affection,” says Dr Leechman; “none who saw him could doubt of it; his air and
                    countenance bespoke it. It was to such a degree his prevailing temper that it
                    gave a tincture to his writings, which were perhaps as much dictated by his
                    heart as his head; and if there was any need of an apology for the stress that
                    in his scheme seems to be laid upon the friendly and public affections<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n424/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0424-0409"/>, the prevalance of them in his own temper would
                    at least form an amiable one.”</p>
                <p>In addition to the works already named, the following were published during
                    Hutcheson’s lifetime:—a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Considerations on
                    Patronage, addressed to the Gentlemen of Scotland,</hi> 1735 <hi rend="italic"

                    published anonymously.</p>
                <p>After his death, his son, Francis Hutcheson, M.D., published in two volumes,
                    quarto, what is much the longest, though by no means the most interesting, of
                    his works, <hi rend="italic">A System of Moral Philosophy, in Three Boohs,</hi>
                    London, 1755. To this is prefixed a life of the author, by Dr William Leechman,
                    professor of divinity in the university of Glasgow. The only remaining work that
                    we are able to assign to Hutcheson is a small treatise on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Logic,</hi> which, according to his biographer, was “not designed for the
                    public eye,” but which was published by Foulis at Glasgow in 1764. This
                    compendium, together with the <hi rend="italic">Compendium of Metaphysics,</hi>
                    was republished at Strasburg in 1772.</p>
                <p>Of all these works, however, those alone on which Hutcheson’s philosophical
                    reputation rests are the four essays, and perhaps the letters, all published
                    during his residence in Dublin. To the more distinctive features of his
                    philosophical system, so far as they may be gathered from these and his other
                    works, we now proceed to draw attention. In the publication of the first two
                    essays, Hutcheson acted quite rightly in connecting his name on the title-page
                    with that of Shaftesbury. There are no two names, perhaps, in the history of
                    English moral philosophy, which stand in a closer connexion. The analogy drawn
                    between beauty and virtue, the functions assigned to the moral sense, the
                    position that the benevolent feelings form an original and irreducible part of
                    our nature, and the unhesitating adoption of the principle that the test of
                    virtuous action is its tendency to promote the general welfare, or good of the
                    whole, are at once obvious and fundamental points of agreement between the two
                    authors.</p>
                <p>According to Hutcheson, man has a variety of senses, internal as well as
                    external, reflex as well as direct, the general definition of a sense being “any
                    determination of our minds to receive ideas independently on our will, and to
                    have perceptions of pleasure and pain” <hi rend="italic">{Essay οη∙the Nature
                    and Conduct of the Passions,</hi> sect. 1). He does not attempt to give an
                    exhaustive enumeration of these “senses,” but, in various parts of his works, he
                    specifies, besides the five external senses commonly recognized (which, he
                    rightly hints, might be added to),—(1) consciousness, by which each man has a
                    perception of himself and of all that is going on in his own mind (“Sensus
                    quidam internus, aut conscientia, cujus ope nota sunt ea omnia, quae in mente
                    gerantur; hac animi vi se novit quisque, suique sensum habet,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaph.</hi><hi rend="italic">Syn.,</hi> pars i. cap. 2); (2) the sense of
                    beauty (sometimes called specifically “an internal sense”); (3) a public sense,
                    or sensus communis, “a determination to be pleased with the happiness of others
                    and to be uneasy at their misery;” (4) the moral sense, or “moral sense of
                    beauty in actions and affections, by which we perceive virtue or vice, in
                    ourselves or others;” (5) a sense of honour, or praise and blame, “which makes
                    the approbation or gratitude of others the necessary occasion of pleasure, and
                    their dislike, condemnation, or resentment of injuries done by us the occasion
                    of that uneasy sensation called shame”; (6) a sense of the ridiculous. It is
                    plain, as the author confesses, that there may be “other perceptions, distinct
                    from all these classes,” and, in fact, there seems to be no limit to the number
                    of “senses” in which a psychological division of this kind might result.</p>
                <p>Of these “senses” that which plays the most important part in Hutcheson’s ethical
                    system is the “moral sense.” It is this which pronounces immediately on the
                    character of actions and affections, approving of those which are virtuous, and
                    disapproving of those which are vicious. “His principal design,” he says in the
                    preface to the two first treatises, “is to show that human nature was not left
                    quite indifferent in the affair of virtue, to form to itself observations
                    concerning the advantage or disadvantage of actions, and accordingly to regulate
                    its conduct. The weakness of ouι ’ reason, and the avocations arising from the
                    infirmity and necessities of our nature are so great that very few men could
                    ever have formed those long deductions of reason, which show some actions to be
                    in the whole advantageous to the agent, and their contraries pernicious. The
                    Author of nature has much better furnished us for a virtuous conduct than our
                    moralists seem to imagine, by almost as quick and powerful instructions as we
                    have for the preservation of our bodies. He has made virtue a lovely form, to
                    excite our pursuit of it, and has given us strong affections to be the springs
                    of each virtuous action.” Passing over the appeal to final, causes involved in
                    this and similar passages, as well as the assumption that the “moral sense” has
                    had no growth or history, but was “implanted” in man exactly in the condition in
                    which it is now to be found among the more civilized races, an assumption common
                    to the systems of both Hutcheson and Butler, it may be remarked that the
                    employment of the term “sense” to designate the approving or disapproving
                    faculty has a tendency to obscure the real nature of the process which, goes on
                    in an act -of moral approbation or disapprobation. For, as is so clearly
                    established by Hume, this act really consists of two parts :—one an act of
                    deliberation, more or less prolonged, resulting in an intellectual judgment; the
                    other a reflex feeling, probably instantaneous, of either satisfaction or
                    repugnance, —of satisfaction at actions of a certain class which we denominate
                    as good or virtuous, of dissatisfaction or repugnance at actions of another
                    class which we denominate as bad or vicious. By the intellectual part of this
                    process we refer the action or habit to a certain class, and invest it with
                    certain characteristics; but no sooner is the intellectual process completed
                    than there is excited in us a feeling similar to that which myriads of actions
                    and habits of the same class, or deemed to be of the same class, have excited in
                    us on former occasions. Now, supposing the latter part of this process to be
                    instantaneous, uniform, and exempt from error, the former certainly is not. All
                    mankind may, apart from their selfish interests, approve of that which is
                    virtuous or makes for the general good, but surely they entertain the most
                    widely divergent opinions, and, if left to their own judgment, would frequently
                    arrive at directly opposite conclusions as to the nature of the particular
                    actions and habits which fall under this class. This distinction is undoubtedly
                    recognized by Hutcheson, as it could hardly fail to be, in his analysis of the
                    mental process preceding moral action, nor does he invariably ignore it, even
                    when treating of the moral approbation or disapprobation which is subsequent on
                    action. Witness the following passages :—“Men have reason given them, to judge
                    of the tendencies of their actions, that they may not stupidly follow the first
                    appearance of public good; but it is still some appearance of good which they
                    pursue” <hi rend="italic">{Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi> sect.
                    4). “All exciting reasons presuppose instincts and affections; and the
                    justifying presuppose a moral sense” <hi rend="italic">{Illustrations upon the
                    Moral Sense,</hi> sect. 1). “When we say one is obliged to an action, we either
                    mean—(1) that the action is necessary to obtain happiness to the agent, or to
                    avoid misery; or (2) that every spectator, or he himself upon reflexion, must
                    approve his action, and disapprove his omitting it, if he considers fully all
                    its circumstances. The former meaning of the word obligation presupposes selfish
                    affections, and the sense of private happiness; the latter meaning includes the
                    moral sense” <hi rend="italic">{Ibid.}.</hi> Notwithstanding these passages,
                    however, it remains true that Hutcheson, both by the phrases which he employs to
                    designate the moral faculty, and by the language in which he ordinarily
                    describes the process of moral approbation, has done much to favour that loose
                    and popular view of morality which, ignoring the difficulties that often attend
                    our moral decisions, and the necessity of deliberation and reflexion, encourages
                    hasty resolves and unpremeditated judgments. The term “moral sense” (which, it
                    may be noticed, had already been employed by Shaftesbury, not only, as Dr
                    Whewell appears to intimate in the margin, but also in the text of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Enquiry'),</hi> if invariably coupled with the term “moral
                    judgment,” would be open to little objection; but, taken alone, as designating
                    the complex process of moral approbation, it is liable to lead not only to
                    serious misapprehension but to grave practical errors. For, if each man’s
                    decisions are solely the result of an immediate intuition of the moral sense,
                    why be at any pains to test, correct, or review them? Or why educate a faculty
                    whose decisions are infallible? The expression has, in fact, the fault of most
                    metaphorical terms; it leads to an exaggeration of the truth which it is
                    intended to suggest.</p>
                <p>But though Hutcheson usually describes the moral faculty as acting instinctively
                    and immediately, he does not, like Butler, confound the moral faculty with the
                    moral standard. The test or criterion of right action is with Hutcheson, as with
                    Shaftesbury, its tendency to promote the general welfare of mankind. “In
                    comparing the moral qualities of actions, in order to regulate our election
                    among various actions proposed, or to find which of them has the greatest moral
                    excellency, we are led by our moral sense of virtue to judge thus—that, in equal
                    degrees of happiness expected to proceed from the action, the virtue is in
                    proportion to the number of persons to whom the happiness shall extend (and here
                    the dignity or moral importance of persons may compensate numbers), and, in
                    equal numbers, the virtue is as the quantity of the happiness<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n425/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0425-0410"/> or natural good; or that the virtue is in a
                    compound ratio of the quantity of good and number of enjoyers. In the same
                    manner, the moral evil, or vice, is as the degree of misery and number of
                    sufferers; so that that action is best which procures the greatest happiness for
                    the greatest numbers, and that worst which, in like manner, occasions misery”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi> sect. 3). What
                    was subsequently called the utilitarian standard is here unhesitatingly adopted
                    by Hutcheson; and it is curious to notice that he actually employs the very
                    phrase which became so celebrated in the mouth of Bentham, though afterwards
                    reduced by that writer to the more simple expression “greatest happiness.”</p>
                <p>The adoption of an external standard, requiring much care and reflexion in its
                    application, ought to have led Hutcheson to see that the moral faculty, by which
                    the standard was to be applied, is by no means so simple and instinctive as he
                    imagined it to be, and that, consequently, these two parts of his system are in
                    reality inconsistent.</p>
                <p>As connected with Hutcheson’s virtual adoption of the utilitarian standard, may
                    be noticed a kind of moral algebra, proposed for the purpose of “computing the
                    morality of actions.” This calculus occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry
                    concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi> sect. 3.</p>
                <p>The most distinctive of Hutcheson’s ethical doctrines, still remaining to be
                    noticed, is what has been called the “benevolent theory” of morals. Hobbes had
                    maintained that all our actions, however disguised under apparent sympathy, have
                    their roots in self-love. Hutcheson not only maintains that benevolence is the
                    sole and direct source of many of our actions, but, by a not unnatural recoil
                    from the repellent doctrine of Hobbes, that it is the only source of those
                    actions of which, on reflexion, we approve. “If we examine all the actions which
                    are accounted amiable anywhere, and inquire into the grounds upon which they are
                    approved, we shall find that, in the opinion of the person who approves them,
                    they always appear as benevolent, or flowing from love of others and a study of
                    their happiness, whether the approver be one of the persons beloved or profited
                    or not; so that all those kind affections which incline us to make others happy,
                    and all actions supposed to flow from such affections, appear morally good, if,
                    while they are benevolent toward some persons, they be not pernicious to others.
                    Nor shall we find anything amiable in any action whatsoever, where there is no
                    benevolence imagined; nor in any disposition, or capacity, which is not supposed
                    applicable to and designed for benevolent purposes” <hi rend="italic">{Inquiry
                    concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi> sect. 3). Consistently with this position,
                    actions which flow from self-love only are pronounced to be morally indifferent:
                    “The actions which flow solely from self-love, and yet evidence no want of
                    benevolence, having no hurtful effects upon others, seem perfectly indifferent
                    in a moral sense, and neither raise the love or hatred of the observer” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ibid. ).</hi> But surely, by the common consent of civilized men,
                    prudence, temperance, cleanliness, industry, self-respect, and in general, the
                    “personal virtues,” as they are called, are regarded, and rightly regarded, as
                    fitting objects of moral approbation. This consideration could hardly escape any
                    author, however wedded to his own system, and Hutcheson attempts to extricate
                    himself from the difficulty by laying down the position that a man may justly
                    regard himself as a part of the rational system, and may thus “be, in part, an
                    object of his own benevolence” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.),—</hi> a curious abuse
                    of terms, which really concedes the question at issue. Moreover, he acknowledges
                    that, though self-love does not merit approbation, neither, except in its
                    èxtreme forms, does it merit condemnation. “We do not positively condemn those
                    as evil who will not sacrifice their private interest to the advancement of the
                    positive good of others, unless the private interest be very small, and the
                    public good very great” <hi rend="italic">{Illustrations upon the Moral
                    Sense,</hi> sect. 6). The satisfaction of the dictates of self-love, too, is one
                    of the very conditions of the preservation of society. “Self-love is really as
                    necessary to the good of the whole as benevolence,—as that attraction which
                    causes the cohesion of the parts is as necessary to the regular state of the
                    whole as gravitation” <hi rend="italic">(Inquiry concerning Moral Good and
                    Evil,</hi> sect. 17). To press home the inconsistencies involved in these
                    various statements would be a superfluous task.</p>
                <p>Hutcheson’s benevolent view of human nature is illustrated also by his denying
                    that malevolence is an original principle in the constitution of man. “Perhaps
                    our nature is not capable of desiring the misery of any being calmly, farther
                    than it may be necessary to the safety of the innocent; we may find, perhaps,
                    that there is no quality in any object which would excite in us pure
                    disinterested malice, or calm desire of misery for its own sake” <hi
                    rend="italic">(On the Natwe and Conduct of the Passions,</hi> sect. 3). Against
                    this position of Hutcheson, propounded also by Butler <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Serm.</hi> ix.), it might be objected that, even amongst very young children,
                    we often find a singular and precocious love of cruelty. This is, undoubtedly,
                    one of the most curious facts in moral psychology, but it may perhaps be
                    accounted for by supposing it to originate in a combination of morbid curiosity
                    with an equally morbid love of power.</p>
                <p>The vexed question of liberty and necessity appears to be carefully avoided in
                    Hutcheson’s professedly ethical works. But, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synopsis</hi><hi rend="italic">Metaphysicae,</hi> he touches on it in no less
                    than three places, briefly stating both sides of the question, but evidently
                    inclining to that which he designates as the opinion of the Stoics in opposition
                    to what he designates as the opinion of the Peripatetics. This is substantially
                    the same as the doctrine propounded by Hobbes and Locke (to the latter of whom
                    Hutcheson refers in a note), namely, that our will is determined by motives in
                    conjunction with our general character and habit of mind, and that the only true
                    liberty is the liberty of acting as we will, not the liberty of willing as we
                    will. Though, however, his leaning is clear, he carefully avoids dogmatizing,
                    and speaks of the difficulty as “ardua quaestio,” “quaestio vexatissima, quae
                    doctorum et piorum ingenia semper torserat, atque de qua utrinque frustra ad
                    sensum cujusque internum provocatur, earnestly deprecating the angry
                    controversies and bitter dissensions to which the speculations on this subject
                    had given rise.</p>
                <p>If our limits allowed us sufficient space, it would be easy to trace the
                    influence of Hutcheson’s ethical theories on the systems of Hume and Adam Smith.
                    The prominence given by these writers to the analysis of moral action and moral
                    approbation, with the attempt to discriminate the respective provinces of the
                    reason and the emotions in these processes, is undoubtedly due to the influence
                    of Hutcheson. To a study of the writings of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson we might,
                    probably, in large measure, attribute the unequivocal adoption of the
                    utilitarian standard by Hume, and, if this be the case, the name of Hutcheson
                    connects itself, through Hume, with the names of Priestley, Paley, and Bentham.
                    Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> appeared in 1726, the year after the
                    publication of Hutcheson’s two first essays, and the parallelism between the
                    “conscience” of the one writer and the “moral sense” of the other is, at least,
                    worthy of remark.</p>
                <p>In the sphere of mental philosophy and logic, Hutcheson’s contributions are by no
                    means so important or original as in that &lt; f moral philosophy. In the former
                    subject, the influence of Locke is apparent throughout. All the main outlines of
                    Locke’s philosophy seem, at first sight, to be accepted as a matter of course.
                    Thus, in stating his theory of the moral sense, Hutcheson is peculiarly careful
                    to repudiate the doctrine of innate ideas (see, for instance, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi> sect. 1 <hi rend="italic">ad
                    fin.</hi>, and sect. 4; and compare <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Metaphysicoe,</hi> pars i. cap. 2). At the same time, it may be
                    noticed that he shows more discrimination than does Locke in distinguishing
                    between the two uses of this expression, and between the legitimate and
                    illegitimate form of the doctrine <hi rend="italic">{Syn. Metaph.,</hi> pars i.
                    cap. 2). All our ideas are, as by Locke, referred to external or internal sense,
                    or, in other words, to sensation and reflexion (see, for instance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Syn. Metaph.,</hi> pars i. cap. 1; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Logicae</hi><hi rend="italic">Compend.,</hi> pars. i. cap. 1; <hi rend="italic"
                    >System of Moral Philosophy, kook</hi> i. ch. 1). It is, however, a most
                    important modification of Locke’s doctrine, and one which connects Hutcheson’s
                    mental philosophy with that of Reid, when he states that the ideas of extension,
                    figure, motion, and rest “are more properly ideas accompanying the sensations of
                    sight and touch than the sensations of either of these senses;” that the idea of
                    self accompanies every thought; and that the ideas of number, duration, and
                    existence accompany every other idea whatsoever (see <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    the Nature and Conduct of the Passions,</hi> sect. i. art. 1; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syn. Metaph.,</hi> pars i. cap. 1, pars ii. cap. 1; Hamilton on <hi
                    rend="italic">Reid,</hi> p. 124, note). Other important points in which
                    Hutcheson follows the lead of Locke are his depreciation of the importance of
                    the so-called laws of thought, his distinction between the primary and secondary
                    qualities of bodies, the position that we cannot know tLe inmost essences of
                    things (“intimae rerum naturae sive essentiae”), though they excite various
                    ideas in us, and the assumption that external things are known only through the
                    medium of ideas <hi rend="italic">(Syn. Metaph.,</hi> pars i. cap. 1), though,
                    at the same time, we are assured of the existence of an external world
                    corresponding to these ideas. Hutcheson attempts to account for our assurance of
                    the reality of an external world by referring it to a natural instinct (“Idearum
                    plurimas ad res externas, tanquam earundem imagines aut repraesentationes,
                    referre cogimur ab ipsa natura,” <hi rend="italic">Syn.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mctaph.,</hi> pars i. cap. 1). Of the correspondence or similitude between our
                    ideas of the primary qualities of things and the things themselves God alone can
                    be assigned as the cause. This similitude has been effected by Him through a law
                    of nature. “Haec prima qualitatum primariarum perceptio, sive mentis actio
                    quaedam sive passio dicatur; non alia similitudinis aut convenientiae inter
                    ejusmodi ideas et res ipsas causa assignari posse videtur, quam ipse Dens, qui
                    certa naturae lege hoc efficit, ut notiones, quae rebus praesentibus excitantur,
                    sint ipsis similes, aut saltem earum habitudines, si non veras quantitates,
                    depingant” (pars ii. cap. 1). Locke had repeatedly stated that “the primary
                    qualities of bodies are resemblances of them, and their patterns do really exist
                    in the bodies themselves” (see, for instance, <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> bk.
                    ii. ch. 8, sect. 15), and he also speaks of God “annexing” certain ideas to
                    certain motions of bodies <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.,</hi> sect. 13, and
                    elsewhere); but nowhere, we believe, does he propound a theory so precise and
                    definite as that here propounded by Hutcheson, which reminds us at least as much
                    of the speculations of Malebranche as of those of Locke.</p>
                <p>Amongst the more important points in which Hutcheson diverges <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n426/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0426-0411"/> from Locke is his account of the idea of personal
                    identity, which he appears to have regarded as made known to us directly by
                    consciousness. “Mentem suam eandem manere, sibi conscius est quisque, repetentia
                    illa, sive perceptione interna, certissima, ast ineffabili, qua novit suam
                    mentem a mente quavis alia omnino diversam esse” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(f&gt;yn.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mctaph.</hi>, pars. i. cap. 3). The distinction
                    between body and mind, “corpus” or “materia” and “res cogitans,” is more
                    emphatically accentuated by Hutcheson than by Locke. Generally, he speaks as if
                    we had a direct consciousness of mind as distinct from body (see, for instance,
                    <hi rend="italic">Syn. Metaρh.,</hi> pars ii. cap. 3), though, in the posthumous
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy,</hi> he expressly states that we
                    know mind as we know body “by qualities immediately perceived though the
                    substance of both be unknown” (bk. i. ch. 1). The distinction between perception
                    proper and sensation proper, which occurs by implication though it is not
                    explicitly worked out (see Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on
                    Metaphysics,</hi> Leet. 24; Hamilton’s edition of <hi rend="italic">Dugald
                    Stewart's Works,</hi> vol. v. p. 420), the imperfection of the ordinary division
                    of the external senses into five classes, the limitation of consciousness to a
                    special mental faculty (severely criticized in Sir W. Hamilton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Metaphysics,</hi> Leet, xii.), and the disposition to
                    refer on disputed questions of philosophy not so much to formal arguments as to
                    the testimony of consciousness and our natural instincts (“ad gravissima,
                    quaedam in philosophia dogmata amplectenda, non argumentis aut
                    ratiocinationibus, ex rerum perspecta natura petitis, sed potius sensu quodam
                    interno, usu, atque naturae impulsu quodam aut instinctu ducimur,” pars ii. cap.
                    3) are also amongst the points in which Hutcheson supplemented or departed from
                    the philosophy of Locke. The last point can hardly fail to suggest to our
                    readers the “common-sense philosophy” of Reid, and here it may be remarked that
                    the interest attaching to Hutcheson’s psychological and metaphysical views
                    consists very largely in the intermediate position which they occupy between the
                    system of Locke and that of Reid and the later Scottish school. If we confine
                    ourselves to merely enumerating detached questions, he perhaps stands nearer to
                    Locke, but in the general spirit of his philosophy he seems to approach more
                    closely to his Scottish successors.</p>
                <p>The short <hi rend="italic">Compendium of Logic,</hi> which is more original than
                    such works usually are, is chiefly remarkable for the large proportion of
                    psychological matter which it contains. In these parts of the book Hutcheson
                    mainly follows Locke. The technicalities of the subject are passed lightly over,
                    and the book is eminently readable. It may be specially noticed that he
                    distinguishes between the mental result ami its verbal expression [idea—term;
                    judgment— proposition], that he constantly employs the word “idea,” and that he
                    defines logical truth as “convenientia signorum cum rebus significatis” (or
                    “propositionis convenientia cum rebus ipsis,” <hi rend="italic">Syn.
                    Metaph.,</hi> pars i. cap. 3), thus implicitly repudiating a merely formal view
                    of logic.</p>
                <p>Hutcheson may claim to have been one of the earliest modern writers on
                    aesthetics. His speculations on this subject are contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, and Design,</hi> the
                    first of the two treatises published in 1725. He maintains that we are endowed
                    with a special sense by which we perceive beauty, harmony, and proportion. This
                    is a <hi rend="italic">reflex</hi> sense, because it presupposes the action of
                    the external senses of sight and hearing. It may be called an internal sense,
                    both in order to distinguish its perceptions from the mere perceptions of sight
                    and hearing, and because “in some other affairs, where our external senses are
                    not much concerned, we discern a sort of beauty, very like, in many respects, to
                    that observed in sensible objects, and accompanied with like pleasure” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Inquiry,</hi> &amp;c., sect. 1). The latter reason leads him to
                    call attention to the beauty perceived in universal truths, in the operations of
                    general causes, and in moral principles and actions. Thus, the analogy between
                    beauty and virtue, which was so favourite a topic with Shaftesbury, becomes also
                    prominent in the writings of Hutcheson. Scattered up and down the treatise,
                    there are many important and interesting observations which our limits prevent
                    us from noticing. But to the student of mental philosophy it may be specially
                    interesting to remark that Hutcheson both applies the principle of association
                    to explain our ideas of beauty and also sets limits to its application,
                    insisting on there being “a natural power of perception or sense of beauty in
                    objects, antecedent to all custom, education, or example” (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inquiry, b,c.,</hi> sects. 6, 7; Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on
                    Metaphysics,</hi> Leet. 44 <hi rend="italic">ad fin.).</hi></p>
                <p>Hutcheson’s writings gave rise, as they could hardly fail to do, to much
                    controversy among those who were interested in ethical speculations. To say
                    nothing of minor opponents, such as “Philaretus” (Mr Gilbert Burnet, already
                    alluded to), Dr John Balgny, author of two tracts on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Foundation of Moral Goodness,</hi> and Dr John Taylor of Norwich, a Presbyterian
                    minister of considerable reputation in his time, the essays appear to have
                    suggested, by antagonism, at least two works which hold a permanent place in the
                    literature of English ethics. One of these is Butler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation on the Nature of Virtue,</hi> which is, throughout, a criticism of
                    the main positions maintained by Hutcheson. The other is an answer of a far more
                    complete and systematic character, Dr Richard Price’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise
                    of Moral Good and Evil,</hi> which first appeared in 1757. In this work, the
                    author maintains, in opposition to Hutcheson, that actions are <hi rend="italic"
                    >in themselves</hi> right or wrong (an ambiguous expression, which he is not
                    sufficiently careful to explain), that right and wrong are simple ideas
                    incapable of analysis, and that these ideas are perceived immediately by the
                    understanding. Price’s work is remarkable for the close similarity between many
                    of the ideas and even expressions contained in it and those which subsequently
                    became so celebrated in the speculations of Kant. We thus see that, not only by
                    its direct but also by its indirect influence, through the replies which it
                    called forth, the system of Hutcheson, or at least the system of Hutcheson
                    combined with that of Shaftesbury, may be regarded as having contributed, in
                    very large measure, to the formation and development of some of the most
                    important of the modern schools of ethics.</p>
                <p>The original editions of Hutcheson’s various works have been already mentioned.
                    Several additions and alterations were made in the second edition (1726) of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the original of out Ideas of Beauty and
                    Virtue.</hi> This, as well as most of his other works, passed through various
                    editions. Of the <hi rend="italic">System of Moral Philosophy,</hi> however,
                    published after Hutcheson’s death, there is we believe, one edition only.
                    Notices of Hutcheson occur in most histories, both of general philosophy and of
                    moi al philosophy, as, for instance, in part vii. of Adam Smith's <hi
