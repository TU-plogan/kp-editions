                    of which several occur in the temperate northern hemisphere, North-West America
                    excepted, by far the larger number in trυpical Asia and America, and very few in
                    Africa and Australia. In Europe, where <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aquifolium</hi> is the sole surviving species, the genuy was
                    richly represented during the Miocene period by forms at first South American
                    and Asiatic, and later North American in type (Schimper, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paleont. Veget.,</hi> iii. 204,1874). Tho leaves are generally coriaceous and
                    evergreen, and are alternate and stalked; the flowers are commonly dioecious,
                    are in axillary cymes, fascicles, or umbellules, and have a persistent four-to
                    five-lobed or parted calyx, a white, rotate four-or rarely five-or six-cleft
                    corolla, with the four or five stamens adherent to its base in the male,
                    sometimes hypogynous in the female flowers, and a two-to twelve-celled ovary;
                    and the fruit is a globose, very seldom ovoid, and usually red drupe, containing
                    two to sixteen one-seeded stones.</p>

                    raised and cartilaginous below, or, as commonly on the upper branches of the
                    older trees, entire —a peculiarity alluded to by Southey in his poem <hi
                    rend="italic">The Holly Tree.</hi> The flowers, which appear in May, are
                    ordinarily dioecious, as in all the best of the cultivated varieties in

                    rend="italic">{Diff. Forms of Flow.,</hi> p. 297, 1877) says of the holly:
                    “During several years I have examined many plants, but have never found one that
                    was really hermaphrodite.” Shirley Hibberd, however <hi rend="italic">(Gard.
                    Chroη.,</hi> 1877, ii. 777), mentions the occurrence of “flowers bearing globose
                    anthers well furnished with pollen, and also perfect ovaries.” In his opinion,
                    <hi rend="italic">I.</hi><hi rend="italic">Aquifolium</hi> changes its sex from
                    male to female with age. In the female flowers the stamens are destitute of
                    pollen, though but slightly or not at all shorter than in the male flowers: the
                    latter are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"

                    ovary, and a larger corolla, to which the filaments adhere for a greater length.
                    The corolla in male plants falls off entire, whereas in fruit-bearers it is
                    broken into separate segments by the swelling of the young ovary (M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Nab). The holly occurs in Britain, north east
                    Scotland excepted, and in western and southern Europe, from as high as 62° N.
                    lat. in Norway to Turkey and the Caucasus, and in western Asia. It is found
                    generally in forest glades or in hedges, and does not flourish under the shade
                    of other trees. In England it is usually small, probably on account of its
                    destruction for timber, but it may attain to 60 or 70 feet in height, and Loudon
                    mentions one tree at Claremont, in Surrey, of 80 feet. Some of the trees on
                    Bleak Hill, Shropshire, are asserted to be 14 feet in girth at some distance
                    from the ground (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and
                    Q.,</hi> 5th ser., xii. 508). The holly is abundant in France, especially in
                    Britanny. Iζ will grow in almost any soil not absolutely wet, but flourishes
                    best in rather dry than moist sandy loam. Beckmann <hi rend="italic">{Hist. of
                    Invent.,</hi> i. 193, 1846) says that the plant which first induced J. di Castro
                    to search for alum in Italy was the holly, which is there still considered to
                    indicate that its habitat is aluminiferous. The holly is propagated by means of
                    the seeds, which do not normally germinate until their second year (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Arboriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 322), by whip-grafting and
                    budding, and by cuttings of the matured summer shoots, which, placed in sandy
                    soil and kept under cover of a hand-glass in sheltered situations, generally
                    strike root in spring. Transplantation should be performed in damp weather in
                    September and October, or, according to some writers, in spring or on mild days
                    in winter, and care should be taken that the roots are not dried by exposure to
                    the air. It is rarely injured by frosts in Britain, where its foliage and bright
                    red berries in winter render it a valuable ornamental tree. The yield of berries
                    has been noticed to be less when a warm spring, following on a wet winter
                    season, has promoted excess of growth. There are numerous varieties of the
                    holly. Some trees have yellow, and others white or even black fruit. In the
                    fruitless variety <hi rend="italic">laurifolia, “</hi> the most floriferous of
                    all hollies” (Hibberd), the flowers are highly fragrant; the form known as <hi
                    rend="italic">femina</hi> is, on the other hand, remarkable for the number of
                    its berries. The leaves in the unarmed varieties <hi rend="italic"
                    >aureo-marginata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">albo-rnαrgiηata</hi> are of great
                    beauty, and in <hi rend="italic">ferox</hi> they are studded with sharp
                    prickles. The holly is of importance as a hedge-plant (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arboriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 319), and is patient of clipping, which is best
                    performed by the knife. Evelyn’s holly hedge at Say’s Court, Deptford, was 400
                    feet long, 9 feet high, and 5 feet in breadth. To form fences, for which Evelyn
                    recommends the employment of seedlings from woods, the plants should be 9 to 12
                    inches in height, with plenty of small fibrous roots, and require to be set 1 to
                    1^ feet apart, in well-manured and weeded ground, and thoroughly watered.</p>
                <p>The wood of the holly is even-grained and hard, especially when from the
                    heartwood of large trees, and almost as white as ivory, except near the centre
                    of old trunks, where it is brownish. It is employed in inlaying and turning,
                    and, since it stains well, in the place of ebony, as for teapot handles. For
                    engraving it is inferior to box. When dry it weighs about 47⅜ ft per cubic foot.
                    From the bark of the holly bird-li me is manufactured. From the leaves are
                    obtainable a colouring matter named <hi rend="italic">ilixaηthiη, ilicic
                    acid,</hi> and a bitter principle, <hi rend="italic">ilicin,</hi> which has been
                    variously described by different analytical chemists. The leaves have been used
                    in rheumatism, and were at one time, on account of their taste, supposed to be
                    of value in intermittent fever. A. Lonicerus <hi rend="italic">{Kreuterb.,</hi>
                    Th. 1, p. xxxviii,, Frankf., 1582, fol.) speaks of their decoction as a remedy
                    for pain in the side. They are eaten by sheep and deer, and in parts of France
                    serve as a winter fodder for cattle. The berries provoke in man violent emesis
                    and catharsis, but are eaten with immunity by thrushes and other birds. The
                    larvae of the moths <hi rend="italic">Sphinx</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ligustri,</hi> L., and <hi rend="italic">Phoxopteryx</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naevana,</hi> Hb., have been met with on holly. The leaves are mined by the
                    larva of a fly, <hi rend="italic">Phylomyza</hi><hi rend="italic">ilicis,</hi>
                    and both on them and the tops of the young twigs occurs the plant louse <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphis</hi><hi rend="italic">ilicis,</hi> Kalt. (Kaltenbach, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pflanzenfeinde,</hi> p. 427, 1874). The custom of employing holly
                    and other plants for decorative purposes at Christmas is one of considerable
                    antiquity, and has been regarded as a survival of the usages of the Roman
                    Saturnalia, or of an old Teutonic practice of hanging the interior of dwellings
                    with evergreens as a refuge for sylvan spirits from the inclemency of winter. A
                    Border proverb defines an habitual story-teller as one that “lees never but when
                    the hollen is green.” Several popular superstitions exist with respect to holly.
                    In the county of Rutland it is deemed unlucky to introduce it into a house
                    before Christmas Eve. In some English rural districts the prickly and
                    non-prickly kinds are distinguished as “he” and “she” holly; and in Derbyshire
                    the tradition obtains that according as the holly brought at Christmas into a
                    house is smooth or rough, the wife or the husband will be master. Holly that has
                    adorned churches at that season are in Worcestershire and Herefordshire much
                    esteemed and cherished, the possession of a small branch with berries being
                    supposed to bring a lucky year; and Lonicerus <hi rend="italic">{op. cit.)</hi>
                    mentions a notion in his time vulgarly prevalent in Germany that consecrated
                    twigs of the plant hung over a door are a protection against thunder.</p>
                <p>Among the North American species of <hi rend="italic">Ilex</hi> are <hi
                    rend="italic">I. οpαcα,</hi> Ait., which resembles the European tree, and the
