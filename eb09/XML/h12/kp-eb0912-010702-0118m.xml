                    renouncing his profession, he finally devoted himself exclusively to the natural
                    sciences. Having travelled in Italy, France, and England, and profited by the
                    instructions of the anatomist Graaf in Holland, he took the degree of doctor of
                    medicine at Wittemberg; and, after visiting Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, and
                    Sweden, he in 1685 settled in Rome, where he practised physic with great
                    success. At Paris, whither he repaired in 1691, he was elected a member of the
                    Academy of Sciences, and became (1702) teacher of physics and (1705) private
                    physician to the duke of Orleans. He died at Paris, September 24, 1715. In 1702
                    Homberg discovered boracic acid, termed at first the <hi rend="italic"

                    true nature of which was ascertained by Bergman in 1775. What is known as
                    “Romberg’s phosphorus” is a mixture of calcium chloride and lime, which, after
                    heating in a sealed tube and exposure to sunlight, phosphoresces in the
                    dark.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">HOMBURG-vor-der-Höhe,</hi> chief town of the circle of
                    Obertaunus in the Wiesbaden government district of the Prussian province of
                    Hesse-Nassau, is prettily situated on a small stream at the foot of a spur of
                    the Taunus mountains, about 11 miles north of Frankfort-on-the-Main, with which
                    it is connected by rail. Homburg consists of an old and a new town, the latter,
                    founded by the landgrave Frederick II., being regular and well-built. Besides
                    the palatial edifices erected in connexion with the mineral water-cure, the most
                    important buildings are the theatre, the synagogue, and the various churches,
                    schools, and benevolent institutions. On a neighbouring hill stands the castle
                    of the former landgraves, built in 1680, and subsequently enlarged and improved.
                    The White Tower, 183 feet in height, is said to date from Roman times, and
                    certainly existed under the lords of Eppstein, who held the district in the 12th
                    century. The castle is surrounded by extensive grounds, laid out in the manner
                    of an English park. The woollen and linen manufactures of Homburg are
                    unimportant, the prosperity of the town being almost entirely due to the annual
                    influx of visitors, which in the season lasting from May to October inclusive
                    averages 9000 or 10,000. The five mineral springs which form the chief
                    attraction to strangers are very salipe, and contain a considerable proportion
                    of carbonate of lime. Their use is beneficial for diseases of the stomach and
                    intestines, and externally for diseases of the skin and rheumatism. The
                    population of the town in 1875, including the garrison, was 8294.</p>
                <p>Homburg first came into repute as a watering-place in 1834, and owing to its
                    gambling-tables, which were set up soon after, it rapidly became one of the
                    favourite and most fashionable health-resorts of the Continent. In 1849 the town
                    was occupied by Austrian troops for the purpose of enforcing the imperial decree
                    against gambling establishments, but immediately on their withdrawal the bank
                    was again opened, and play continued unchecked till 1872, when the Prussian
                    Government refused to renew the lease for gambling purposes which then expired.
                    As the capital of thy former landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg the town shared the
                    vicissitudes of that state.</p>
