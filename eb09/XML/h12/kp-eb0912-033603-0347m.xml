                    dependent cell, Hugh was attracted from that position by the holy reputation of
                    the monks of the Grande Chartreuse, whose house he finally entered despite an
                    oath to the contrary which he had given his superior. There he remained about
                    ten years, receiving priest’s orders, and rising to the important office of
                    procurator, which brought him into contact with the outer world. The wide
                    reputation for energy and tact which Hugh speedily attained penetrated to the
                    ears of Henry II. of England, and induced that monarch to request the
                    procurator’s assistance in establishing at Witham in Somersetshire the first
                    English Carthusian monastery. Hugh reluctantly consented to go to England, where
                    in a short time he succeeded in overcoming every obstacle, and in erecting and
                    organizing the convent, of which he was appointed first prior. He speedily
                    became prime favourite with Henry, who in 1186 procured his election to the see
                    of Lincoln. Forced sorely against his will to accept this responsible post, Hugh
                    nevertheless set himself actively and piously to discharge its important
                    functions, although at least once a year he retired to live for a short period
                    as a simple monk at Witham. He took little to do with political matters,
                    maintaining as one of his chief principles that a churchman should hold no
                    secular office. A sturdy upholder of what he believed to be right, he let
                    neither royal nor ecclesiastical influence interfere with his conduct, but
                    fearlessly resisted whatever seemed to <pb break="no"

                    or diocese. But with all his bluff firmness Hugh had a calm judgment and a ready
                    tact, which almost invariably left him a better friend than before of those whom
                    he opposed; and the astute Henry, the impetuous Richard, and the cunning John,
                    so different in other points, agreed in respecting the bishop of Lincoln. St
                    Hugh’s manners were a little apt to be boisterous at times, and his early
                    monastic discipline had left him rigid and harsh; but, though an ascetic to
                    himself, “so that his whole life was a continued martyrdom,” he was
                    distinguished by a broad kindliness to others, so that even the Jews of Lincoln
                    wept at his funeral. He had great skill in taming birds, and for some years had
                    a pet swan, which occupies a prominent place in all histories and
                    representations of the saint. In 1200 Bishop Hugh revisited his native country
                    and his first convents, and on the return journey was seized with an illness, of
                    which he died at London, on November 16, 1200. Twenty years later he was
                    canonized.</p>
