                <p><label type="entry">HUMMING-BIRD</label>, a name in use for more than two
                    centuries, and possibly ever since English explorers first knew of the beautiful
                    little animals to which, from the sound occasionally made by the rapid
                    vibrations of their wings, it is applied. Among books that are ordinarily in
                    naturalists’ hands, the name seems to be first found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musoeum</hi><hi rend="italic">Tradescantianum,</hi> published in 1656, but it
                    therein occurs (p.. 3) so as to suggest its having already been accepted and
                    commonly understood; and its earliest use, as yet discovered, is said to be by
                    Thomas Morton in the <hi rend="italic">New English Canaan,</hi> printed in
                    1632—a rare work reproduced by Peter Force in his <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Tracts</hi> (vol. ii., Washington, 1838). Thevet, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Singularitez de la France</hi><hi rend="italic">antarctique</hi> (Antwerp,
                    1558, fol. 92), has been more than once cited as the earliest author to mention
                    Humming-birds, which he did under the name of <hi rend="italic">Gouambuclr,</hi>
                    but it is quite certain that Oviedo, whose <hi rend="italic">Hystoria general de
                    las lndias</hi> was published at Toledo in 1525, preceded him by more than
                    thirty years, with an account of the “<hi rend="italic">paxaro mosquito</hi>” of
                    Hispaniola, of which island “the first chronicler of the Indies” was
                    governor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the edition
                    of Oviedo’s work, published at Salamanca in 1547, the earliest the present
                    writer has been able to see, the account (lib. xiv. cap. 4) runs thus:—“Ay assi
                    mismo enesta ysla vnos paxaricos tan negros como vn terciopelo negro muy bueno
                    &amp; son tan pequenos que ningunos he yo visto en Indias menores∕ excepto el
                    que aca se llama paxaro mosquito. El quai es tan pequefto que el bulto del es
                    menor harto o assaz que le cabeça del dedo pulgar de la mano. Este no le he
                    visto enesta Ysla pero dizen me que aqui los ay: &amp; por esso dexo de hablar

                    träte.” A modern Spanish version of this passage will be found in the beautiful
                    edition of Oviedo’s works published by the Academy of Madrid in 1851 (i. p.
                    444).</p></note> This name, though now apparently disused in Spanish, must have
                    been current about that time, for we find Gesner in 1555 <hi rend="italic">(De
                    avium</hi><hi rend="italic">natura,</hi> iii. p. 629) translating it literally
                    into Latin as <hi rend="italic">Passer muscatus,</hi> owing, as he says, his
                    knowledge of the bird to Cardan, the celebrated mathematician, astrologer, and
                    physician, from whom we learn <hi rend="italic">(Comment.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    that, on his return to Milan from professionally attending Archbishop Hamilton
                    at Edinburgh, he visited Gesner at Zurich, about the end of the year 1552.<note

                    name still survives in the French <hi rend="italic">Oiseau-mouche</hi>; but the
                    ordinary Spanish appellation is, and long has been, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tominejo,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">tomin,</hi> signifying a weight equal to
                    the third part of an <hi rend="italic">adarme</hi> or drachm, and used
                    metaphorically for anything very small. Humming-birds, however, are called by a
                    variety of other names, many of them derived from American languages, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Guainumbi, Ourissia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Colibri,</hi>
                    to say nothing of others bestowed upon them (chiefly from some peculiarity of
                    habit) by Europeans, like <hi rend="italic">Picaflores, Chuparosa,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Froufrou.</hi> Barrere, in 1745, conceiving that Hummingbirds were

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Under this name Pliny perpetuated <hi

                    confusion that had doubtless arisen before his time of two very distinct birds.
                    As Sundevall remarks <hi rend="italic">{Tentamen,</hi> p. 87, note), <hi
                    rend="italic">τροχίλος</hi> was evidently the name commonly given by the ancient
                    Greeks to the smaller Plovers, and was not improperly applied by Herodotus (ii.
                    68) to the species that feeds in the open mouth of the Crocodile—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pluυianus</hi><hi rend="italic">oegyptius</hi> of modern
                    ornithologists—in which sense Aristotle <hi rend="italic">{Hist.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Animalium,</hi> ix. 6) also uses it. But the received text of
                    Aristotle has two other passages (ix. 1 and 11) wherein the word appears in a
                    who(ly different connexion, and can there be only taken to mean the Wren—the
                    usual Greek name of which would seem to be <hi rend="italic">opχιλos</hi>
                    (Sundevall, <hi rend="italic">Om Aristotl. Djurarter,</hi> No. 54). Though none
                    of his editors or commentators have suggested the possibility of such a thing,
                    one can hardly help suspecting that in these passages some early copyist has
                    substituted <hi rend="italic">τροχίλος</hi><hi rend="italic">tor
                    l&gt;pχιλos,</hi> and so laid the foundation of a curious error. It may be here
                    remarked that the Crocodile of St Domingo is said to have the like office done
                    for it by some kind of bird, which is called by Descourtilz (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyage,</hi> iii. p. 26), a <hi rend="italic">“Todier,"</hi> but, as Geoffr. St
                    Hilaire observes <hi rend="italic">{Descr.</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l'Egypte,</hi> ed. 2, xxiv. p. 440), is more probably a Plover. Unfortunately
                    the fauna of Hispaniola is not much better known now than in Oviedo’s
                    days.</p></note> in part, of Pliny, applied that name in a generic sense <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ornith. Spec, novum,</hi> pp. 47, 48) to both. Taking the hint
                    thus afforded, Linnaeus very soon after went further, and, excluding the Wrens,
                    founded his genus <hi rend="italic">Trochilus</hi><hi rend="italic">for</hi> the
                    reception of such Humming-birds as were known to him. The unfortunate act of the
                    great nomenclator cannot be set aside; and, since his time, ornithologists with
                    but few exceptions have followed his example, so that now-a-days Humming-birds
                    are universally recognized as forming the Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trochilidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The relations of the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidae</hi> to other birds were for a
                    long while very imperfectly understood. Nitzsch first drew attention to their
                    agreement in many essential characters with the Swifts, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypselidae,</hi> and placed the two Families in one group, which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">Macrochires,</hi> from the great length of their manual bones, or
                    those forming the extremity of the wing. The name was perhaps not very happily
                    chosen, for it is not the distal portion that is so much out of ordinary
                    proportion to the size of the bird, but the proximal and median portions, that
                    in both Families are curiously dwarfed. Still the <hi rend="italic">manus,</hi>
                    in comparison with the other parts of the wing, is so long that the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Macrochires</hi> is not wholly inaccurate. The affinity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trochi-</hi><hi rend="italic">lidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypselidae,</hi> once pointed out, became obvious to every careful and
                    unprejudiced investigator, and there are probably few systematists now living
                    who refuse to admit its validity. More than this, it is confirmed by an
                    examination of other osteological characters. The “lines,” as a boat-builder
                    would say, upon which the skeleton of each form is constructed are precisely
                    similar, only that whereas the bill is very short and the head wide in the
                    Swifts, in the Humming birds the head is narrow and the bill long— the latter
                    developed to an extraordinary degree in some of the <hi rend="italic"

                    portion of the Humming-bird’s skeleton is the <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi>
                    which in proportion to the size of the bird is enormously developed both
                    longitudinally and vertically, its deep keel and posterior protraction affording
                    abundant space for the powerful muscles which drive the wings in their rapid
                    vibrations as the little creature poises itself over the flowers where it finds
                    its food.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                    especially the case with the smaller species of the group, for the larger,
                    though shooting with equal celerity from place to place, seem to flap their
                    wings with comparatively slow but not less powerful strokes. The difference was
                    especially observed with respect to the largest of all Humming-birds, <hi

                <p>So far as is known, all Humming-birds possess a protrusible tongue, in

                    it is seated being greatly elongated, passing round and over the back part of
                    the head, near the top of which they meet, and thence proceed forward, lodged in
                    a broad and deep groove, till they terminate in front of the eyes. But, unlike
                    the tongue of the Woodpeckers, that of the Humming-birds consists of two
                    cylindrical tubes, tapering towards the point, and forming two sheaths which
                    contain the extensile portion, and are capable of separation, thereby
                    facilitating the extraction of honey from the nectaries of flowers, and with it,
                    what is of far greater importance for the bird’s sustenance, the small insects
                    that have been attracted to feed upon the honey.<note anchored="true"

                    correlated therewith, will be found subject to several and perhaps considerable
                    modifications, as is the case in various members of the <hi rend="italic"

                    not save Edwards and Latham from the charge of careless misstatement, when they
                    declare that they had received such a bird from that island. Next to their

                    forms, in which respect they are surpassed by no other birds, and are only
                    equalled by a few, as, for instance, by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nectariniidoe,</hi> or Sunbirds of the tropical parts of the Old World, in
                    popular estimation so often confounded with them, and even by some mistaken
                    naturalists thought to be their allies.</p>
                <p>The number of species of Humming-birds now known to exist considerably exceeds
                    400; and, though none depart very widely from what a morphologist would deem the
                    typical structure, of the Family, the amount of modification, within certain
                    limits, presented by the various forms is surprising and even bewildering to the
                    uninitiated. But the features that are ordinarily chosen by systematic
                    ornithologists in drawing up their schemes of classification are found by the
                    “trochilidists,” or special students of the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe,</hi>
                    insufficient for the purpose of arranging these birds in groups, and characters
                    on which genera can be founded have to be sought in the style and coloration of
                    plumage, as well as in the form and proportions of those parts which are most
                    generally deemed sufficient to furnish them. Looking to the large number of
                    species to be taken into account, convenience has demanded what science would
                    withhold, and the genera established by the ornithologists of a preceding
                    generation have been broken up by their successors into multitudinous
                    sections—the more adventurous making from 150 to 180 of such groups, the modest
                    being content with 120 or thereabouts, but the last dignifying each of them by
                    the title of genus. It is of course obvious that these small divisions cannot be
                    here considered in detail, nor would much advantage accrue by giving statistics
                    from the works of the latest trochilidists, Messrs Gould<note anchored="true"

                    expedient to notice the fact that some of the authors of the last century<note

                    now know as the Family <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> into two groups, the
                    distinction between which was that in the one the bill was arched and in the
                    other straight, since that difference has been insisted on in many works. This
                    was especially the view taken by Brisson and Buffon, who termed the birds having
                    the arched bill <hi rend="italic">“Colibris,"</hi> and those having it straight
                    “<hi rend="italic">Oiseaux-mouches."</hi> The distinction wholly breaks down,
                    not merely because there are <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> which possess
                    almost every gradation of decurvation of the bill, but some which have the bill
                    upturned after the manner of that strange bird the Avocet,<note anchored="true"

                    by those authorities among the “<hi rend="italic">Colibris</hi>” are not
                    Humming-birds at all.</p>
                <p>The extraordinarily brilliant plumage which most of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trochilidoe</hi> exhibit has been already mentioned, and in describing it
                    ornithologists have been compelled to adopt the vocabulary of the jeweller in
                    order to give an idea of the indescribable radiance that so often breaks forth
                    from some part or other of the investments of these feathered gems. In all save
                    a few of other birds, the most imaginative writer sees gleams which he may
                    adequately designate metallic, from their resemblance to burnished gold, bronze,
                    copper, or steel, but such similitudes wholly fail when he has to do with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe,</hi> and there is hardly a precious stone—ruby,
                    amethyst, sapphire, emerald, or topaz—the name of which may not fitly, and
                    without any exaggeration, be employed in regard to Humming-birds. In some cases
                    this radiance beams from the brow, in some it glows from the throat, in others
                    it shines from the tail-coverts, in others it sparkles from the tip only of
                    elongated feathers that crest the head or surround the neck as with a frill,
                    while again in others it may appear as a luminous streak across the cheek or
                    auriculars. The feathers that cover the upper parts of the body very frequently
                    have a metallic lustre of golden-green, which in other birds would be thought
                    sufficiently beautiful, but in the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidoe</hi> its sheen
                    is overpowered by the almost dazzling splendour that radiates from the spots
                    where Nature’s lapidary has set her jewels. The flight feathers are almost
                    invariably dusky—the rapidity of their movement would, perhaps, render any
                    display of colour ineffective; while, on the contrary, the feathers of the tail,
                    which, as the bird hovers over its foodbearing flowers, is almost always
                    expanded, and is therefore comparatively motionless, often exhibit arich
                    translucency, as of stainedglass, but iridescent in a manner that no stained
                    glass ever is—cinnamon merging into crimson, crimson changing to purple, purple
                    to violet, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0370-0359"/> and so to indigo and bottle-green. But this part
                    of the Hummingbird is subject to quite as much modification in form as in
                    colour, though always consisting of ten <hi rend="italic">rectrices.</hi> It may
                    be nearly square, or at least but slightly rounded, or wedge-shaped with the
                    middle quills prolonged beyond the rest; or, again, it may be deeply forked,
                    sometimes by the overgrowth of one or more of the intermediate pairs, but most
                    generally by the development of the outer pair. In the last case the lateral
                    feathers may be either broadly webbed to their tip, or acuminate, or again, in
                    some forms, may lessen to the filiform shaft, and suddenly enlarge into a
                    terminal spatulation as in the forms known as “Racquet-tails.” The wings do not
                    offer so much variation; still there are a few groups in which diversities occur
                    that require notice. The primaries are invariably ten in number, the outermost
                    being the longest, except in the single instance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aithurus,</hi> where it is shorter than the next. The group known as
                    "Sabre-wings,” comprising the genera <hi rend="italic">Campylopterus,
                    Eupetomena,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sphenoproctus,</hi> present a most
                    curious sexual peculiarity, for while the female has nothing remarkable in the
                    form of the wing, in the male the shaft of two or three of the outer primaries
                    is dilated proximally, and bowed near the middle in a manner almost unique among
                    birds. The feet again, diminutive as they are, are very diversified in form. In
                    most the tarsus is bare, but in some groups, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eriocnemis,</hi> it is clothed with tufts of the most delicate down, sometimes
                    black, sometimes buff, but more often of a snowy whiteness. In some the toes are
                    weak, nearly equal in length, and furnished with small rounded nails; in others
                    they are largely developed, and armed with long and sharp claws.</p>
                <p>Apart from the well-known brilliancy of plumage, of which enough has been here
                    said, many Humming-birds display a large amount of ornamentation in the addition
                    to their attire of crests of various shape and size, elongated ear-tufts,
                    projecting, neck-frills, and pendant beards—forked or forming a single point.
                    But it would be impossible here to dwell on a tenth of these beautiful
                    modifications, each of which as it comes to our knowledge excites fresh surprise
                    and exemplifies the ancient adage— <hi rend="italic">maxime miranda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in minimis</hi><hi rend="italic">Natura.</hi> It must be remarked,
                    however, that there are certain forms which possess little or no brilliant
                    colouring at all, but, as most tropical birds go, are very soberly clad. These
                    are known to trochilidists as “Hermits,” and by Mr Gould have been separated as
                    a Subfamily under the name of <hi rend="italic">Phaethornithinoe,</hi> though Mr
                    Elliot says he cannot find any characters to distinguish it from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trochilidae</hi> proper. But sight is not the only sense that is
                    affected by Humming-birds. The large species known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptero-phanes temmincki</hi> has a strong musky odour, very similar to that
                    given off by the Petrels, though, so far as appears to be known, that is the
                    only one of them that possesses this property.<note anchored="true"

                <p>All well-informed people are aware that the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidae</hi>
                    are a Family peculiar to America and its islands, but one of the commonest of
                    common errors is the belief that Humming-birds are found in Africa and India—to
                    say nothing even of England. In the first two cases the mistake arises from
                    confounding them with some of the brightly-coloured Sun-birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nectariniidae),</hi> to which British colonists or residents are apt to apply
                    the better-known name; but in the last it can be only due to the want of
                    perception which disables the observer from distinguishing between a bird and an
                    insect —the object seen being a Hawk-Moth <hi rend="italic">(Macroglossa),</hi>
                    whose mode of feeding and rapid flight certainly bears some resemblance to that
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidae,</hi> and hence one of the species <hi
                    rend="italic">{M.</hi><hi rend="italic">stellarum)</hi> is very generally called
                    the "Humming-bird Hawk-Moth.” But though confined to the New World the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trochilidae</hi> pervade almost every part of it. In the south <hi
                    rend="italic">Eustephanus</hi><hi rend="italic">galeritus</hi> has been seen
                    flitting about the fuchsias of Tierra del Fuego in a snow-storm, and in the

                    summer visits the ribes-blossoms of Sitka, while in the north-east <hi
                    rend="italic">Trochilus colubris</hi> charms the vision of Canadians as it
                    poises itself over the althaea-bushes in their gardens, and extends its range at
                    least so far as lat. 57° N. Nor is the distribution of Humming-birds limited to
                    a horizontal direction only, it rises also vertically. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oreotrochilus chimborazo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">0. pichincha</hi> live on
                    the lofty mountains whence each takes its trivial name, but just beneath the
                    line of perpetual snow, at an elevation of some 16,000 feet, dwelling in a world
                    of almost constant hail, sleet, and rain, and feeding on the insects which
                    resort to the indigenous flowering plants, while other peaks, only inferior to
                    these in height, are no less frequented by one or more species. Peru and Bolivia
                    produce some of the most splendid of the Family—the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cometes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Diphlogoena,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thaumastura,</hi> whose very names indicate the glories of their bearers. The
                    comparatively gigantic <hi rend="italic">Patagona</hi> inhabits the west coast
                    of South America, while the isolated rocks of Juan Fernandez not only afford a
                    home to the <hi rend="italic">Eustephanus</hi> before mentioned, but also to two
                    other species of the same genus which are not found elsewhere (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 745). The slopes of the Northern Andes
                    and the hill country of Colombia furnish perhaps the greatest number of forms,
                    and some of the most beautiful, but leaving that great range, we part company
                    with the largest and most gorgeously arrayed species, and their number dwindles
                    as we approach the eastern coast. Still there are many brilliant Humming-birds
                    common enough in the Brazils, Guiana, and Venezuela. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysolampis mosquitus</hi> is perhaps the most plentiful. Thousands of its
                    skins are annually sent to Europe to be used in the manufacture of ornaments,
                    its rich ruby-and-topaz glow rendering it one of the most beautiful objects
                    imaginable. In the darkest depths of the Brazilian forests dwell the
                    russet-clothed brotherhood of the genus <hi rend="italic">Phaethornis—</hi> the
                    " Hermits but the great wooded basin of the Amazons seems to be particularly
                    unfavourable to the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidae,</hi> and from Para to Ega
                    there are scarcely a dozen species to be met with. There is no island of the
                    Antilles but is inhabited by one or more Humming-birds, and there are some very
                    remarkable singularities of geographical distribution to be found (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 749). Northwards from Panama, the
                    highlands present many genera, whose names it would be useless here to insert,
                    few or none of which are found in South America—though that must unquestionably
                    be deemed the metropolis of the Family, and advancing towards Mexico the numbers
                    gradually fall off. Eleven species have been enrolled among the fauna of the
                    United States, but some on slender evidence, while others only just cross the
                    frontier line.</p>
                <p>But little room is left to speak of the habits of Humming-birds, which is perhaps
                    of the less consequence since the subject, as regards most of the species which
                    in life have come under the observation of ornithologists, has been so ably
                    treated by writers like Waterton, Wilson, and Audubon, to say nothing of Mr
                    Gosse, Mr Wallace, Mr Bates, and some others, while, whatever novelty further
                    investigation may supply, it is certain that at present we lack information that
                    will explain the origin or the function of the many modifications of external
                    structure of which mention has been made. But there is no one appreciative of
                    the beauties of nature who will not recall to memory with delight the time when
                    a live Humming-bird first met his gaze. The suddenness of the apparition, even
                    when expected, and its brief duration, are alone enough to fix the fluttering
                    vision on the mind’s eye. The wings of the bird, if flying, are only visible as
                    a thin grey film, bounded above and below by fine black threads, in form of a St
                    Andrew’s cross,—the effect on the observer s retina of the instantaneous
                    reversal of the motion of the wing at each beat—the strokes being so rapid as to
                    leave no more distinct image. Consequently an adequate representation of the
                    bird on the wing cannot be produced by the draughtsman. Humming-birds show to
                    the greatestad van tage when engagedin contest with another, for rival cocks
                    fight fiercely, and, as may be expected, it is then that their plumage flashes
                    with the most glowing tints. But these are quite invisible to the ordinary
                    spectator except when very near at hand, though doubtless efficient enough for
                    their object, whether that be to inflame their mate or to irritate or daunt
                    their opponent, or something that we cannot compass. Humming-birds, however,
                    will also often sit still for a while, chiefly in an exposed position, on a dead
                    twig, occasionally darting into the air, either to eatch a passing insect or to

                    times bigger than themselves, without, as would seem, any provocation.</p>
                <p>The food of Humming-birds consists mainly of insects, mostly gathered in the
                    manner already described from the flowers they visit; but, according to Mr
                    Wallace, there are many species which he has never seen so occupied, and the
                    “Hermits” especially seem to live almost entirely upon the insects which are
                    found on the lower surface of leaves, over which they will closely pass their
                    bill, balancing themselves the while vertically in the air. The same excellent
                    observer also remarks that even among the common flower-frequenting species he
                    has found the alimentary canal entirely filled with insects, and very rarely a
                    trace of honey. It is this fact doubtless that has hindered almost all attempts
                    at keeping them in confinement for any length of time—nearly every one making
                    the experiment having fed his captives only with syrup, which is wholly
                    insufficient as sustenance, and seeing therefore the wretched creatures
                    gradually sink into inanition and die of hunger.</p>
                <p>The beautiful nests of Humming-birds, than which the work of fairies could not be
                    conceived more delicate, are to be seen in most museums, and will be found on
                    examination to be very solidly and tenaciously built, though the materials are
                    generally of the slightest —cotton-wool or some vegetable down and spiders’
                    webs. They vary greatly in form and ornamentation—for it would seem that the
                    portions of lichen which frequently bestud them are affixed to their exterior
                    with that object, though probably concealment was the original intention. They
                    are mostly cup-shaped, and the singular fact is on record <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Zool. Journal,</hi> v. p. 1) that in one instance as the young grew in size
                    the walls were heightened by the parents, until at last the nest was more than
                    twice as big as when the eggs were laid and hatched. Some species, however,
                    suspend their nests from the stem or tendril of a climbing plant, and more than
                    one case has been known in which it has been attached to a hanging rope. These
                    pensile nests are said to have been found loaded on one side with a small stone
                    or bits of earth to ensure their safe balance, though how the compensatory
                    process is applied no one can say. Other species, and especially those belonging
                    to the “Hermit” group, weave a frail structure round the side of a drooping
                    palm-leaf. The eggs are nevermore than two in number, quite white, and having
                    both ends nearly equal. The solicitude for her offspring displayed by the mother
                    is not exceeded by that of any other birds, but it seems doubtful whether the
                    male takes any interest in the brood. (A. N.)</p>
