                <p><label type="entry">HONTHORST, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gerard van</hi></label> (born
                    at Utrecht 1590, died at Utrecht 1656), was brought up as a painter at the
                    school of Bloemart, who exchanged the style of the Franckens for that of the
                    pseudo-Italians at the beginning of the 16th century. Infected thus early with a
                    mania which came to be very general in Holland, Honthorst went to Italy, where
                    he copied the naturalism and eccentricities of Michelangelo da Caravaggio. Home
                    again about 1614, after acquiring a considerable practice in Rome, he set up a
                    school at Utrecht which flourished exceedingly; and he soon became so
                    fashionable that Sir Dudley Carleton, then English envoy at the Hague,
                    recommended his works to the earl of Arundel and Lord Dorchester. At the same
                    time the queen of Bohemia, sister of Charles I. and electress palatine, being an
                    exile in Holland, gave him her countenance and asked him to teach her children
                    drawing; and Honthorst, thus approved and courted, became known to Charles I.,
                    who invited him to England. There he painted several portraits, and a vast
                    allegory, now at Hampton Court, of Charles and his queen as Diana and Apollo in
                    the clouds receiving the duke of Buckingham as Mercury and guardian of the king
                    of Bohemia’s children. Charles I., whose taste was flattered alike by the energy
                    of Rubens and the elegance of Van Dyck, was thus first captivated by the
                    fanciful mediocrity of Honthorst, who though a poor executant had luckily for
                    himself caught, as Lord Arundel said, “much of the manner of Caravaggio’s
                    colouring, then so much esteemed at Rome.” It was his habit to transmute every
                    subject into a night scene, from the Nativity, for which there was warrant in
                    the example of Correggio, to the penitence of the Magdalen, for which there was
                    no warrant at all. But unhappily this caprice, though “sublime in Allegri and
                    Rembrandt,” was but a phantasm in the hands of Honthorst, whose prosaic pencil
                    was not capable of more than vulgar utterances, and art gained little from the
                    repetition of these quaint vagaries. Sandrart gave the measure of Honthorst’s
                    popularity at this period when he says that he had as many as twenty apprentices
                    at one time, each of whom paid him a fee of 100 florins a year. In 1623 he was
                    president of his guild at Utrecht. After that he went to England as above
                    stated, returning to settle anew at Utrecht, where he married. His position
                    amongst artists was acknowledged to be important, and in 1626 he received a
                    visit from Rubens, whom he painted as the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0155-0144"/> honest man sought for and found by Diogenes
                    Honthorst. In his home at Utrecht Honthorst succeeded in preserving the support
                    of the English monarch, for whom he finished in 1631 a large picture of the king
                    and queen of Bohemia “and all their children.” For Lord Dorchester about the
                    same period he completed some illustrations of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Odyssey,</hi> one of which survives in the Weld-Blundell collection at
                    Ince; for the king of Denmark he composed incidents of Danish history, of which
                    one example remains in the gallery of Copenhagen. In the course of a large
                    practice he had painted many likenesses—Charles I. and his queen, the duke of
                    Buckingham, and the king and queen of Bohemia. He now became court painter to
                    the princess of Orange, settled (1637) at the Hague, and painted in succession
                    at the Castle of Ryswick and the House in the Wood. The time not consumed in
                    producing pictures was devoted to portraits. Even now his works are very
                    numerous, and amply represented in English and Continental galleries. His most
                    attractive pieces are those in which he cultivates the style of Caravaggio,
                    those, namely which represent taverns, with players, singers, and eaters. He
                    shows great skill in reproducing scenes illuminated by a single candle. But he
                    seems to have studied too much in dark rooms, where the subtleties of flesh
                    colour are lost in the dusky smoothness and uniform redness of tints procurable
                    from farthing dips. Of great interest still, though rather sharp in outline and
                    hard in modelling, are his portraits of the Duke of Buckingham and Family
                    (Hampton Court), the King and Queen of Bohemia (Hanover and Combe Abbey), Mary
                    de Medici (Amsterdam town-hall, 1628), the Stadt-hυlders and their Wives
                    (Amsterdam and Hague), Charles Louis and Rupert, Charles I.’s nephews (Louvre,
                    St Petersburg, Combe Abbey, and Willin), and Lord Craven (National Portrait
                    Gallery). His early form may be judged by a Lute-player (1614) at the Louvre,
                    the Martyrdom of St John in S. M. della Scala at Rome, or the Liberation of
                    Peter in the Berlin Museum; his latest style is that of the House in the Wood
                    (1648), where he appears to disadvantage by the side of Jordaens and others.
                    Honthorst was succeeded by his brother William, born at Utrecht in 1604, who
                    died it is said in 1666. He lived chiefly in his native place, temporarily at
                    Berlin. But he has left little behind except a portrait at Amsterdam, and
                    likenesses in the Berlin Museum of William and Mary of England.</p>
