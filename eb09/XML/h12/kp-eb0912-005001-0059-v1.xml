                <p><label type="entry">HOGG, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1770-1835), a
                    Scottish poet, best known by his title of the “Ettrick Shepherd,” was born on
                    the banks of the Ettrick in Selkirkshire in 1770. His ancestors had been
                    shepherds for centuries. He received hardly any school training, and seems to
                    have had difficulty in getting books to read. After spending his early years
                    under different masters, first as cow-herd and afterwards as shepherd, he was
                    engaged in the latter capacity by Mr Laidlaw, tenant of Blackhouse, in the
                    parish of Yarrow, from 1790 till 1799. He was treated with great kindness, and
                    had access to a large collection of books, which he soon exhausted, and then
                    subscribed to a circulating library in Peebles. While attending to his flock, he
                    spent a great deal of time in reading. His first printed piece was “The Mistakes
                    of a Night,” which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi> for
                    October 1794, and was succeeded by <hi rend="italic">Scots Pastorals</hi> in
                    1801. A year or two after this publication Hogg became acquainted with Sir
                    Walter Scott—a connexion which had a powerful influence for good on the peasant
                    poet. He again appeared before the public in 1807 as the author of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mountain Bard,</hi> to which Scott wrote an introductory
                    notice. By this work, and by a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Diseases of
                        Sheep,</hi> Hogg realized about £300. With this money he unfortunately
                    embarked in farming in Dumfriesshire, and in three years was utterly ruined, and
                    had to abandon all his effects to his creditors. He returned to Ettrick, and
                    there found only cold and estranged looks. He could not even obtain employment
                    as a shepherd; so he set off in February 1810 to push his fortune in Edinburgh
                    as a literary adventurer. In the same year he published a collection of songs,
                    which, being dedicated to the countess of Dalkeith, and recommended to her
                    notice by Scott, was rewarded with a present of 100 guineas. He then commenced a
                    weekly periodical, <hi rend="italic">The Spy,</hi> which he continued from
                    September 1810 till August 1811. The appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s
                        Wake</hi> in 1813 established Hogg’s reputation as a poet; it was followed
                    by <hi rend="italic">Mador</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Moor, The Pilgrims of
                        the Sun,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Poetic Mirror.</hi> The duchess of
                    Bucci euch, on her death-bed in 1814, had asked the duke to do something for the
                    Ettrick bard; and the duke gave him a lease for life of the farm of Altrive in
                    Yarrow, consisting of about 70 acres of moorland, on which the poet built a
                    house and spent the last years of his life. He took possession of it in 1817;
                    but his literary exertions were never relaxed. Before 1820 he had written <hi
                        rend="italic">The Brownie of Bodsbeck,</hi> and two volumes of <hi
                        rend="italic">Winter Evening Tales,</hi> besides collecting, editing, and
                    writing part of two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Jacobite Relics,</hi> and
                    contributing largely to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine.</hi> In 1820 he
                    married Miss Margaret Phillips, a lady of a good Annandale family, and found
                    himself possessed of about £1000, a good house, and a well-stocked farm. Hogg’s
                    connexion with <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine</hi> kept him continually
                    before the public. The wit and mischief of some of his literary friends made
                    free with his name, and represented him in ludicrous and grotesque aspects; but
                    the effect of the whole was favourable to his popularity. He visited London in
                    1831, and was feasted by the nobility, literati, and public men of the
                    metropolis. On his return a public dinner was given to him in Peebles,—Professor
                    Wilson in the chair,—and he acknowledged that he had at last “found fame.” His
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0060-0051"/> health, however, was seriously impaired. With
                    his pen in his hand to the last, Hogg in 1834 published a volume of <hi
                        rend="italic">Lay Sermons,</hi> and in 1835 two volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Montrose Tales.</hi> His illness ultimately assumed the form of dropsy, and
                    after a short confinement he died November 21, 1835, having nearly completed his
                    sixty-fifth year. He was buried in the churchyard of his native parish Ettrick.
                    His fame had seemed to fill the whole district, and was brightest at its close;
                    his presence was associated with all the Border sports and festivities; and as a
                    man James Hogg was ever frank, joyous, and charitable.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar</hi> is the best of Hogg’s prose works;
                    but it is mainly as a great peasant poet that he lives in literature. Nothing
                    can be more exquisite than some of his lyrics and minor poems—his “Skylark,”
                    “When the Kye comes Hame,” his verses on the “Comet” and “Evening Star,” and his
                    “Address to Lady Ann Scott.” The <hi rend="italic">Queen's Wake</hi> unites his
                    characteristic excellences—his command of the old romantic ballad style, his
                    graceful fairy mythology, and his aerial flights of imagination. The story of
                    Kilmeny stands at the head of all our fairy tales, and is inimitable for its
                    scenes of visionary splendour, purity, and bliss, linked to the fairest objects
                    of earthly interest and affection. In such compositions Hogg seems completely
                    transformed; he is absorbed in the ideal and supernatural, and might have
                    claimed over all his contemporaries the Delphic laurel for direct and immediate
                    inspiration.</p>
