                <p><label type="entry">HOMICIDE</label>, in law, is the act of killing a human
                    being, whether such act be criminal or not. Blackstone distinguishes three kinds
                    of homicide—(1) justifiable, (2) excusable, and (3) felonious.</p>
                <p>The most important case of justifiable homicide is the execution of a criminal in
                    due course of public justice. This condition is most stringently interpreted.
                    “To kill the greatest of malefactors deliberately, uncompelled, and
                    extra-judicially is murder. . . . And further, if judgment of death be given by
                    a judge not authorized by lawful commission, and execution is done accordingly,
                    the judge is guilty of murder” (Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi>
                    book vi. c. iv.). The execution must be carried out by the proper officer or his
                    deputy: any person executing the sentence without such authority, were it the
                    judge himself, would be guilty of murder. And the sentence must be strictly
                    pursued: to execute a criminal by a kind of death other than that to which he
                    has been judicially condemned is murder.</p>
                <p>Homicide committed by an officer of justice in the course of carrying out his
                    duty, as such, is also justifiable; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> where a person
                    resists a legal arrest and is killed in the struggle; where officers in
                    dispersing a riotous assemblage kill any of the mob, &amp;c. In these cases the
                    homicide must be shown to have been absolutely necessary. Again, homicide
                    committed for the prevention of forcible and heinous crime, such as violent
                    robbery, or murder, or housebreaking during the night, is justifiable.</p>
                <p>Excusable homicide is homicide committed either by misadventure or in
                    self-defence. In the former case, where a man in the course of doing some lawful
                    work, accidentally and without intention kills another, the homicide is excused;
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> shooting at a mark and undesignedly hitting and
                    killing a man. Tlιe act must be strictly lawful, and death by misadventure in
                    unlawful sports is not a case of excusable homicide. Homicide in self-defence is
                    excusable when the slayer is himself in immediate danger of death, and has done
                    all he could to avoid the assault. Accordingly, if he strikes and kills his
                    assailant after the assault is over, this is not excusable homicide. And if the
                    assault has been premeditated, as in the case of a duel, the death of either
                    antagonist is murder, and not excusable homicide. The excuse of <hi
                        rend="italic">se defendendo</hi> covers the case in which a person in
                    defence of others whom it is his duty to protect—children, wife, master,
                    &amp;c.—kills an assailant. It has been considered doubtful whether the plea of
                    self-defence is available to one who has himself provoked a fray, in the course
                    of which he is so pressed by his antagonist that his only resource is to kill
                    him.</p>
                <p>The distinction between excusable and justifiable homicides refers back to a
                    period in the history of the law when the former were considered to carry with
                    them some taint of guilt, and to require some kind of punishment or expiation.
                    In early law homicide, however innocent, subjects the slayer to the lawful
                    vengeance of the kindred of the dead man. We have a good example of this feeling
                    in the Jewish institution of cities of refuge, to which innocent manslayers
                    might flee from the avenger of blood. The case mentioned in Deut. xix. 5 is a
                    typical instance of what we should call excusable homicide :—“A man goeth into
                    the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the
                    axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0136-0125"/> from the helve, and lighteth upon his
                    neighbour, that he die.” In English law, the same feeling long remained.
                    Excusable homicide involved at least forfeiture of goods, which, however, might
                    be recovered as a matter of course by the innocent criminal obtaining a pardon
                    and writ of restitution. Afterwards judges appear to have been in the habit of
                    directing an acquittal in such cases. It is only by a statute so recent as 9
                    Geo. IV. c. 31 that the innocence of excusable homicide is expressly
                    declared.</p>
                <p>Felonious homicide includes <hi rend="smallcaps">Suicide, Manslaughter,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Murder</hi> —the law relating to which is discussed
                    under the different headings. These distinctions of the English law correspond
                    generally to those of other systems. The chief difficulty is the definition of
                    murder—the distinction between the highest and second degree of criminal
                    homicide. In English law the element of malice aforethought chiefly
                    distinguishes murder from manslaughter. In Scotland the term culpable homicide
                    is the equivalent of the manslaughter of English law.</p>
