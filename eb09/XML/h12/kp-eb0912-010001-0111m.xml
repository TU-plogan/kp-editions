                    bornât Prague on July 13, 1607, and died in Westminster, being buried at St
                    Margaret’s church on March 28, 1677. His family was ruined by the capture of
                    Prague in the Thirty Years’ War, and young Hollar, who had been destined for the
                    law, determined to become an artist. The earliest of his works that have come
                    down to us are dated 1625 and 1626; they are small plates, and one of them is a
                    copy of a Virgin and Child by Durer, whose influence upon Hollar’s work was
                    always <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0112-0101"/> great. In 1627 he was at Frankfort, working under
                    Matthew Merian, an etcher and engraver; thence he passed to Strasburg and
                    thence, in 1633, to Cologne. It was there that he attracted the notice of the
                    famous amateur Thomas, earl of Arundel, then on an embassy to the imperial
                    court; and with him Hollar travelled to Vienna and Prague, and finally came in
                    1637 to England, destined to be his home for many years. Though he lived in the
                    household of Lord Arundel, he seems to have worked not exclusively for him, but
                    to have begun that slavery to the publishers which was afterwards the normal
                    condition of his life. In his first year in England he made for Stent, the
                    printseller, the magnificent View of Greenwich, nearly a yard long, and received
                    thirty shillings for the plate,— perhaps a twentieth part of what would now be
                    paid for a single good impression. Afterwards we hear of his fixing the price of
                    his work at fourpence an hour, and measuring his time by a sandglass. The civil
                    war had its effect on his fortunes, but none on his industry. Lord Arundel left
                    England in 1642, and Hollar passed into the service of the duke of York, taking
                    with him a wife and two children. With other royalist artists, notably Inigo
                    Jones and Faithorne, he stood the long and eventful siege of Basing House; and
                    as we have some hundred plates from his hand dated during the years 1643 and
                    1644 he must have turned his enforced leisure to good purpose. Taken prisoner,
                    he escaped or was released, and joined Lord Arundel at Antwerp, and there he
                    remained eight years, the prime of his working life, when he produced his finest
                    plates of every kind, his noblest views, his miraculous “muffs” and “shells,”
                    and the superb portrait of the duke of York. In 1652 he returned to London, and
                    lived for a time with Faithorne the engraver near Temple Bar. During the
                    following years were published many books which he illustrated:—Ogilby’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Virgil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Homer,</hi> Stapylton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Juvenal,</hi> and Dugdale’s <hi rend="italic">Warwickshire, St
                    Panes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mon-αsticon</hi> (part i.). The booksellers
                    continued to impose on the simple-minded foreigner, pretending to decline his
                    work that he might still further reduce the wretched price he charged them. Nor
                    did the Restoration improve lιis position. The court did nothing for him, and in
                    the great plague he lost his young son, who, we are told, might have rivalled
                    his father as an artist. After the great fire he produced some of his famous
                    “Views of London”; and it may have been the success of these plates which
                    induced the king to send him, in 1668, to Tangier, to draw the town and forts.
                    During his return to England occurred the desperate and successful engagement
                    fought by his ship the “Mary Rose,” under Captain Kempthorne, against seven
                    Algerine men-of-war,—a brilliant affair which Hollar etched for Ogilby’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Africa.</hi> He lived eight years after his return, still working
                    for the booksellers, and retaining to the end hhwonderful powers; witness the
                    large plate of Edinburgh (dated 1670), one of the greatest of his works. He died
                    in extreme poverty, his last recorded words being a request to the bailiffs that
                    they would not carry away the bed on which he was dying.</p>
                <p>Hollar has been called by a recent critic “the most accurate delineator and the
                    most ingenious illustrator of his time, and as to technic the most able etcher.”
                    His variety was boundless; his plates number some 2740, and include views,
                    portraits, ships, religious subjects, heraldic subjects, landscapes, and still
                    life in a hundred different forms. No one that ever lived has been able to
                    represent fur, or shells, or a butterfly’s wing, as he has done. His
                    architectural drawings, such as those of Antwerp and Strasburg cathedrals, and
                    his views of towns, are mathematically exact, but they are pictures as well. He
                    could reproduce the decorative works of other artists quite faultlessly, as in
                    the famous chalice after Mantegna’s drawing. His <hi rend="italic">Theatrum
                    Mulierum</hi> and similar collections reproduce for us with literal truth the
                    outward aspects of the people of his day; and his portraits, a branch of art in
                    which he has been unfairly disparaged, are of extraordinary refinement and
                    power. His genius is wholly unlike that of his great contemporary Rembrandt; it
                    aims rather at the delicate rendering of details than at the truth of character
                    and the mystery of light and shade. But in his own way Hollar is as perfect as
                    Rembrandt.</p>
                <p>Almost complete collections of Hollar’s works exist in the British Museum and in
                    the library at Windsor Castle. Two admirable catalogues of his plates have been
                    made, one in 1745 (2d ed., 1759), by George Vertue, and one in 1853 by Parthey.
                    The latter, published at Berlin, is a model of German thoroughness and accuracy,
                    and leaves very little to be added by future research.</p>
