                    gives with one of them 10 acres in marriage to the man that marries her, and
                    dies seized of the other 20; now she that is thus married, to gain her share of
                    the rest of the land, must put her part given in marriage into hotch-pot; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> she must refuse to take the profits thereof, and cause
                    her land to be so mingled with the other that an equal division of the whole may
                    be made between her and her sister, as if none had been given to her; and thus
                    for her 10 acres she shall have 15, or otherwise the sister will have the 20.”
                    In the common law this seems to have been the only instance in which the rule
                    was applied, and the reason assigned for it is that, inasmuch as daughters
                    succeeding to lands take together as coparceners and not by primogeniture, the
                    policy of the law is that the land in such cases should be equally divided. The
                    law of hotchpot applies only to lands descending in fee-simple. The same
                    principle is noticed by Blackstone as applying in the customs of York and London
                    to personal property, It is also expressly enacted in the Statute of
                    Distributions (§ 5) that no child of the intestate, except his heir-at-law, who
                    shall have any estate in land by the settlement of the intestate, or who shall
                    be advanced by the intestate in his life time by pecuniary portion equal to the
                    distributive shares of the other children, shall participate with them in the
                    surplus; but if the estate so given to such child by way of advancement be not
                    equivalent to their shares, then such part of the surplus as will make it equal
                    shall be allotted to him. It has been decided that this provision applies only
                    to advancements by <hi rend="italic">fathers,</hi> on the ground that the rule
                    was founded on the custom of London, which never affected a widow’s personal
                    estate. The heir-at-law is not required to bring any land which he has by
                    descent or otherwise from the deceased into hotch-pot, but advancements made to
                    him out of ehe personal property must be brought in. The same principle is to be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">collatio bonorum</hi> of the Roman law:
                    emancipated children, in order to share the inheritance of their father with the
                    children unemancipated, were required to bring their property into the common
                    fund. It is also found in the law of Scotland. “It seemeth,” says Littleton,
                    “that this word <hi rend="italic">hotch-pot</hi> is in English a pudding; for in
                    a pudding is not commonly put one thing alone, but one thing with other things
                    together.”</p>
