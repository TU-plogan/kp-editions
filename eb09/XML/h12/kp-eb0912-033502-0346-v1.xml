                    (1630-1721), bishop of Avranches, is the last of those encyclopaedic and massive
                    scholars of whom France produced so many. He left no successor to his omnivorous
                    learning, prodigious memory, and indomitable energy. He was born at Caen of a
                    family formerly Huguenot. He lost both father and mother while still a child,
                    and was brought up by his aunt, wife of the mathematician Gilles Macé, to whom
                    he owed his respect , for science. He says himself that the ardour of study did
                    not possess him in earnest until in early manhood he was reading the <hi
                        rend="italic">Géographie Sacrée</hi> of Bochart, and suddenly became
                    intoxicated with the desire of becoming a scholar. It may be remarked that a
                    youth who was not already studious would hardly be reading such a book. However,
                    the statement means that he began about that time to study not in earnest only
                    but with passion and fury. In Hebrew alone so great was bis industry that he
                    read through the Old Testament in the original no less than four-and-twenty
                    times during his life. At the age of twenty he had already achieved a reputation
                    as one of the most promising scholars of the time. He went at the age of
                    twenty-one to Paris, where he formed a friendship with Gabriel Maude,
                    conservator of the Mazarin library. In the following year Bochart, being invited
                    by Queen Christina to her court at Stockholm, took his friend Huet with him.
                    This journey, in which he saw Leyden, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen, as well as
                    Stockholm, resulted chiefly in the discovery of some fragments of Origen’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Commentary on St Matthew,</hi> which gave Huet the idea of
                    editing Origen. On his return to France he assisted at the foundation of the
                    academy of Caen, and shortly afterwards quarrelled with his friend Bochart, who
                    accused him of having suppressed a line in Origen in tho Eucharistic
                    controversy. Shortly afterwards he removed to Paris, where he entered into close
                    relations with Chapelain. At this time arose the famous dispute of Ancients and
                    Moderns. Huet took the side of the Ancients against Charles Perrault and
                    Desmarets. Among his friends at this period were Corrart and Pellisson. His
                    taste for mathematics led him to the study of astronomy, and in 1672 he founded
                    the Academy of Science at Caen. He next turned his attention to anatomy, and,
                    being himself shortsighted, devoted his inquiries mainly to the question of
                    vision and the formation of the eye. In this pursuit he made more than 800
                    dissections. He theη learned all that was then to be learned in chemistry, and
                    wrote a Latin poem on salt. All this time he was no mere book-worm or recluse,
                    but was haunting the salons of Mlle, de Scudéry and the studios of painters; nor
                    did his scientific researches interfere with his classical studies, for during
                    this time he was discussing with Bochart the origin of certain medals, and was
                    learning Syriac and Arabic under the J esuit Parvilliers. N or did he neglect
                    the lighter walks of letters. He translated the pastorals of Longus, wrote a
                    tale called <hi rend="italic">Diane de Castro,</hi> and defended in a treatise
                    on the origin of romance the reading of fiction. Then, being appointed assistant
                    tutor to the Dauphin, he edited with the assistance of Anne Lefèvre, afterwards
                    Madame Dacier, the well-known edition of the classics <hi rend="italic">ad usum
                        Delphini.</hi> He also continued to work upon his edition of Origen, and
                    issued one of his greatest works, the <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Évangélique.</hi> It was at the age of forty-six that he took
                    orders, a step which he had contemplated for some years. Two years later the
                    king gave him the abbey of Aunay, where he wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Questions</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Aunay, sur l'accord de la Foi et de la
                        Raison,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Critique de la Philosophie de
                        Descartes,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire du
                        Cartésianisme,</hi> his dissertation on the site of the terrestrial
                    paradise, and his discussion with Boileau on the Sublime. In 1685 he was made
                    bishop of Soissons, but after waiting for installation for four years he took
                    the bishopric of Avranches instead. He exchanged the cares of his bishopric for
                    what he thought would be the easier chair of the Abbey of Fontenay, but there he
                    was vexed with continual law suits. At length he retired to the Jesuits’ House
                    in the Rue Saint Antoine at Paris, where he ended his days, in 1721, amidst
                    incessant labours maintained to the end, at the age of ninety-one. His great
                    library and manuscripts, after being bequeathed to the Jesuits, were bought by
                    the king for the royal library.</p>
                <p>It is impossible here to enter upon an estimate of the place in philosophy,
                    literature, and scholarship now occupied by this remarkable and omnivorous
                    student. It has been disputed whether a writer who could so strenuously advocate
                    the claim of philosophy could have been at the same time an orthodox believer.
                    Perhaps like many other men Huet separated his creed from his philosophy, and
                    while he argued on Descartes forgot that he was a bishop. In the <hi
                        rend="italic">lluetiana</hi> will be found the most ready materials for
                    arriving at an idea of his prodigious labours, exact memory, and wide
                    scholarship. His own autobiography, found in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentarius</hi><hi rend="italic">de rebus ad</hi><hi rend="italic">eum
                        pertinentibus,</hi> was translated into English by Dr Aiken in 1726. It
                    remains to be said that he owed the preservation of his faculties to extreme
                    old’age, and perhaps the prolongation of his life, to the rigid observance of a
                    spare diet which he began at the age of forty, dining moderately, and taking no
                    other supper than a little bouillon.</p>
