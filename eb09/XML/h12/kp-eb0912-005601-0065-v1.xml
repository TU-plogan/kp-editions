                        Baron</hi></label> (1684-1754), the greatest of Scandinavian writers, was
                    born at Bergen, in Norway, on the 3d of December 1684. Both Holberg’s parents
                    died in his childhood, his father first, leaving a considerable property; and in
                    his tenth year he lost his mother also. Before the litter event, however, the
                    family had been seriously impoverished by a great fire, which destroyed several
                    valuable buildings, but notwithstanding this, the mother left to each of her six
                    children some little fortune. In 1694 the boy Holberg was taken into the house
                    of his uncle, who sent him to the Latin school, and prepared him for the
                    profession of a soldier; but soon after this he was adopted by his cousin Otto
                    Munthe, and went to him up in the mountains. His great desire for instruction,
                    however, at last induced his family to send him back to Bergen, to his uncle,
                    and there he remained, eagerly studying, until the destruction of that city by
                    fire in 1702, when he was sent to the university of Copenhagen. But he soon
                    exhausted his resources, and, having nothing to live upon, was glad to hurry
                    back to Norway, where he accepted the position of tutor in the house of a rural
                    dean at Voss. He soon returned to Copenhagen, where in 1704 he took his degree,
                    and worked hard at French, English, and Italian. But he had to gain his living,
                    and accordingly he accepted the post of tutor once more, this time in the house
                    of Dr Smidt, vice-bishop of Bergen. The good doctor had travelled much, and the
                    reading of his itineraries and note-books awakened such a longing for travel in
                    the young Holberg that at last, in 1706, having scraped together 60 dollars, he
                    went on board a ship bound for Holland. He proceeded as far as Aix-la-Chapelle,
                    where he fell sick of a fever, and suffered so much from weakness and poverty,
                    that he made his way to Amsterdam, and came back to Norway. Ashamed to be seen
                    so soon in Bergen, he stopped at Christianssand, where he lived through the
                    winter, supporting himself by giving lessons in French. In the spring he
                    travelled, in company with a student named Brix, through London to Oxford, where
                    he studied for two years, gaining his livelihood by giving lessons on the violin
                    and the flute. He mentions, with gratitude, the valuable libraries of Oxford,
                    and it is pleasant to record that it was while he was there that it first
                    occurred to him, as he says, “how splendid and glorious a thing it would be to
                    take a place among the authors.” Through London and Elsinore he reached
                    Copenhagen a third time, and began to lecture at the university; his lectures
                    were attended, but he got no money. He was asked in 1709 to conduct a rich young
                    gentleman to Dresden, and on his return journey he lectured at Leipsic, Halle,
                    and Hamburg. Once more in Copenhagen, he undertook to teach the children of
                    Admiral Gedde. Weary with this work, he took a post at Borch College in 1710,
                    where he wrote, but did not print, his first work, <hi rend="italic">A Universal
                        History,</hi> and was permitted to present to King Frederick IV. two
                    manuscript essays on Christian IV and Frederick III. The king soon after
                    presented him with the Rosenkrantz grant of 100 dollars for four years, the
                    holder of which was expected to travel. Holberg accordingly started in 1715, and
                    visited, chiefly on foot, a great portion of Europe. From Amsterdam he walked
                    through Rotterdam to Antwerp, took a boat to Brussels, and on foot again reached
                    Γaris. Walking and skating, he proceeded in the depth of winter to Marseilles,
                    and on by sea to Genoa. On the last-mentioned voyage he caught a fever, and
                    nearly died in that city. On his recovery he pushed, on to Civita Vecchia and
                    Rome. When the spring had come, being still very poor and in feeble health, he
                    started homewards on foot by Florence, across the Apennines, through Bologna,
                    Parma, Piacenza, Turin, over the Alps, through Savoy and Dauphiné to Lyons, and
                    finally to Paris, where he arrived in excellent health. After spending a month
                    in Paris, he walked on to Amsterdam, took sail to Hamburg, and so went back to
                    Denmark in 1716. He spent the next two years in extreme poverty, and published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Natural and Popular Law.</hi> But at last,
                    in 1718, his talents were recognized by his appointment as professor of
                    metaphysics at the university of Copenhagen; and in 1720 he was promoted to the
                    lucrative chair of public eloquence, which gave him a seat in the consistory.
                    His pecuniary troubles were now at an end. Hitherto he had written only on law,
                    history, and philology, although in a Latin controversy with the jurist Andreas
                    Hover of Flensborg his satirical genius had flashed out. But now, and until
                    1728, he created an entirely new class of humorous literature under the
                    pseudonym of Hans Mikkelsen. The serio-comic epic of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Peder</hi><hi rend="italic">Paars,</hi> one of the great classics of the
                    Danish language, appeared in 1719. This poem was a brilliant satire on
                    contemporary manners, and enjoyed an extraordinary success. But the author had
                    offended in it several powerful persons who threatened his life, and if Count
                    Danneskjold had not personally interested the king in him, Holberg’s career
                    might have had an untimely close. During the next two years he published five
                    shorter satires, all of which were well received by the public. The great event
                    of 1721 was the erection of the first Danish theatre in Grönnegade, Copenhagen;
                    Holberg took the direction of this house, in which was played, in September
                    1722, a Danish translation of <hi rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Avare.</hi> Until <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0066-0057"/> this time no plays had been acted in Denmark
                    except in French and German, but Holberg now determined to use his talent in the
                    construction of Danish comedy. The first of his original pieces performed was
                        <hi rend="italic">Den politiske Hand-</hi><hi rend="italic">stöber</hi> (The
                    Pewterer turned Politician); he wrote other comedies with miraculous rapidity,
                    and before 1722 was closed, there had been performed in succession, and with
                    immense success, <hi rend="italic">Den</hi><hi rend="italic">Voegelsindede</hi>
                    (The Waverer), <hi rend="italic">Jean de Prance, Jeppe paa Bjerget,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Gert the Westphalian.</hi> Of these five plays, four at least
                    are masterpieces; and they were almost immediately followed by others. Holberg
                    took no rest, and before the end of 1723 the comedies of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Barselstuen</hi> (The Lying-in Room), <hi rend="italic">The Eleventh of
                        July, Jakob von Thyboe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Den Bundeslose</hi> (The
                    Fidget), <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi><hi rend="italic">Montanus,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Don Ranudo, Ulysses of Ithaca, Without Head or Tail,
                        Witchcraft,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melampe</hi> had all been written,
                    and some of them acted. In 1724 the most famous comedy that Holberg produced was
                        <hi rend="italic">Henrik and Pernille.</hi> But in spite of this
                    unprecedented blaze of dramatic genius the theatre fell into pecuniary
                    difficulties, and had to be closed, Holberg composing for the last night’s
                    performance a <hi rend="italic">Funeral of Danish Comedy.</hi> All this
                    excessive labour for the stage had undermined the great poet’s health, and in
                    1725 he determined to take the baths at Aix-la-Chapelle; but instead of going
                    thither he wandered through Belgium to Paris, and spent the winter there. In the
                    spring he returned to Copenhagen with recovered health and spirits, and worked
                    quietly at his protean literary labours until the great fire of 1728. In the
                    period of national poverty and depression that followed this event, a
                    puritanical spirit came into vogue which was little in sympathy with Holberg’s
                    dramatic or satiric genius. He therefore closed his career as a dramatic poet by
                    publishing in 1731 his acted comedies, with the addition of five which he had no
                    opportunity of putting on the stage. With characteristic versatility, he adopted
                    the serious tone of the new age, and busied himself for the next twenty years
                    with historical, philosophical, and statistical writings. During this period he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Description of Denmark and Norway</hi> (1729),
                        <hi rend="italic">History of Denmark, Universal Church History, Biographies
                        of Famous Men, Moral Reflections, Description of Bergen (VlWVj, A History of
                        the Jews,</hi> and other learned and laborious compilations. The only poem
                    he published at this time was the famous <hi rend="italic">Nicolai Klimii
                        Iter</hi><hi rend="italic">Subterraneum,</hi> 1741, afterwards translated
                    into Danish by Baggesen. When Christian VI. died in 1748, the theatre was
                    reopened and Holberg was appointed director, but he soon resigned this arduous
                    post. His last published work was his <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> in 5
                    vols. In 1747 he was made Baron af Holberg. In August 1753 he took to his bed,
                    and he died at Copenhagen on the 28th of January 1754, in the seventieth year of
                    his age. He was buried at Sorö, in Zealand. He had never married, and he
                    bequeathed all his property, which was considerable, to Sorö College.</p>
                <p>Holberg was not only the founder of Danish literature and the greatest of Danish
                    authors, but he was, with the exception of Voltaire, the first writer in Europe
                    during his own generation. Neither Pope nor Swift, who perhaps excelled him in
                    particular branches of literary production, approached him in range of genius,
                    or in encyclopaedic versatility. Holberg found Denmark provided with no books,
                    and he wrote a library for her. When he arrived in the country, the Danish
                    language was never heard in a gentleman’s house. Polite Danes were wont to say
                    that a man wrote Latin to his friends, talked French to the ladies, called his
                    dogs in German, and only used Danish to swear at his servants. The single genius
                    of Holberg revolutionized this system. He wrote poems of all kinds in a language
                    hitherto employed only for ballads and hymns; he instituted a theatre, and
                    composed a rich collection of comedies for it; he filled the shelves of the
                    citizens with works in their own tongue on history, law, politics, science,
                    philology, and philosophy, all written in a true and maιdy style, and
                    representing the extreme attainment of European culture at the moment. Perhaps
                    no author who ever lived has had so vast an influence over his countrymen, an
                    influence that is still at work after 200 years.</p>
                <p>The editions of Holberg’s works are legion. During the last twenty-five years
                    five complete editions of the <hi rend="italic">Comedies</hi> have appeared, of
                    which the best is that brought out in 3 vols, by F. L. Lichtenberg, in 1870. Of
                        <hi rend="italic">Ρeder Pααrs</hi> there exist at least twenty-three
                    editions, besides translations in Dutch, German, and Swedish. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Iter</hi><hi rend="italic">Subterraneum</hi> has been three
                    several times translated into Danish, ten times into German, thrice into
                    Swedish, thrice into Dutch, thrice into English, twice into French, twice into
                    Russian, and once into Hungarian. The life of Holberg was written by Welhaven in
                    1858. Among works on his genius by foreigners may be mentioned an exhaustive
                    study by Robert Prutz, 1857, and. <hi rend="italic">Holberg</hi><hi
