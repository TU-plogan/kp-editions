                    1638-1709), the greatest landscape painter of the Dutch school after Ruysdael,
                    lived at Amsterdam in the second half of the 17th century. His merit has been
                    but recently recognized, whence the obscurity in which his life remains. Nothing
                    is more disappointing than to find that in Hobbema’s case chronology and signed
                    pictures substantially contradict each other. According to the latter his
                    practice lasted from 1650 to 1689; according to the former his birth occurred in
                    1638, his death as late as 1709. That no attempt has yet been made to reconcile
                    these contradictions is strange. It is perfectly clear that if the masterpiece
                    of the late Bredel collection, called A Wooded Stream, honestly bears the date
                    of 1650, or The Cottages under Trees of the Ford collection the date of 1652,
                    the painter of these canvases cannot be Hobbema, whose birth took place in 1638,
                    unless indeed we admit that Hobbema painted some of his finest works at the age
                    of twelve or fourteen. No doubt, as regards signatures, there is much in
                    Hobbema’s creations to excite suspicion. For a considerable period it was
                    profitable to pass Hobbemas as Ruysdaels, and the name of the lesser master was
                    probably erased from several of his productions. When Hobbema’s talent was
                    recognized, the contrary process was followed, and in this way the name, and
                    perhaps fictitious dates, reappeared by fraud. It is difficult to account for
                    the discrepancies of pictures and chronology by any other cause. Yet this leaves
                    unexplained why dates as well as names should have been forged. An experienced
                    eye will note the differences which occur in Hobbema’s signatures in such well
                    known examples as adorn the galleries of London and Rotterdam, or the Grosvenor
                    and Van der Hoop collections. The dates can only be tested by chemical means.
                    Meanwhile, we must be content to know that, if the question of dates could be
                    brought into accordance with records and chronology, the facts of Hobbema’s life
                    would be as follows. Meyndert Hobbema was married at the age of thirty to
                    Eeltije Vinck of Gorcum, in the Oudekerk or old church at Amsterdam, on the 2d
                    of November 1668. Witnesses to the marriage were the bride’s brother Cornelius
                    Vinck and Jacob Ruysdael. We might suppose from this that Hobbema and Ruysdael,
                    the two great masters of landscape, were united at this time by ties of
                    friendship, and accept the belief that the former was the pupil of the latter.
                    Yet even this is denied to us, since records tell us that there were two Jacob
                    Ruysdaels, cousins and contemporaries, at Amsterdam in the middle of the 17th
                    century—one a framemaker, the son of Solomon, the other a painter, the son of
                    Isaac Ruysdael. Of Hobbema’s marriage there came between 1668 and 1673 four
                    children. In 1704 Eeltije died, and was buried in the pauper section of the
                    Leyden cemetery at Amsterdam. Hobbema himself survived till December 1709,
                    receiving burial on the 14th of that month in the pauper section of the
                    Westerkerk cemetery at Amsterdam. Husband and wife had lived during their
                    lifetime in the Rozengracht, at no great distance from Rembrandt, who also dwelt
                    there in his later and impoverished days. Rembrandt, Hals, Jacob Ruysdael, and
                    Hobbema were in one respect alike. They all died in misery, insufficiently
                    rewarded perhaps for their toil, imprudent perhaps in the use of the means
                    derived from their labours. Posterity has recognized that Hobbema and Ruysdael
                    together represent the final development of landscape art in Holland. Their
                    style is so related that we cannot suppose the first to have been unconnected
                    with the second. Still their works differ in certain ways, and their character
                    is generally so marked that we shall find little difficulty Jin distinguishing
                    them, nor indeed shall we hesitate in separating those of Hobbema from the
                    feebler productions of his imitators and predecessors—Isaac Ruysdael, Rontbouts,
                    De Vries, Dekker, Looten, Verboom, Du Bois, Van Kessel, Van der Hagen, even
                    Philip de Koningk. In the exercise of his craft Hobbema was patient beyond all
                    conception. It is doubtful whether any one ever so completely mastered as he did
                    the still life of woods and hedges, or mills and pools. Nor can we believe that
                    he obtained this mastery otherwise than by constantly dwelling in the same
                    neighbourhood, say in Guelders or on the Dutch Westphalian border, where day
                    after day he might study the branching and foliage of trees and underwood
                    embowering cottages and mills, under every variety of light, in every shade of
                    transparency, in all changes produced by the seasons. Though his landscapes are
                    severely and moderately toned, generally in an olive key, and often attuned to a
                    puritanical grey or russet, they surprise us, not only by the variety of their
                    leafage, but by the finish of their detail as well as the boldness of their
                    touch. With astonishing subtlety light is shown penetrating cloud, and <pb

                    steadily, different portions of the ground, shining through leaves upon other
                    leaves, and multiplying in an endless way the transparency of the picture. If
                    the chance be given him he mirrors all these things in the still pool near a
                    cottage, the reaches of a sluggish river, or the swirl of the stream that feeds
                    a busy mill. The same spot will furnish him with several pictures. One mill
                    gives him repeated opportunities of charming our eye; and this wonderful artist,
                    who is only second to Ruysdael because he had not Ruysdael’s versatility and did
                    not extend his study equally to downs and rocky eminences, or torrents and
                    estuaries— this is the man who lived penuriously, died poor, and left no trace
                    in the artistic annals of his country! It has been said that Hobbema did not
                    paint his own figures, but transferred that duty to Adrian van de Velde,
                    Lingelbach, Barendt Gael, and Abraham Storck. As to this much is conjecture.</p>
                <p>The best of Hobbema’s dated pictures are those of the years 1663 to 1667. Of the
                    former, several in the galleries of Brussels and St Petersburg, and one in the
                    Holford collection, are celebrated. Another was shown as the property of Lord
                    Hatherton at Manchester. Of 1665 fine specimens are in the Grosvenor gallery and
                    the collection of Sir R. Wallace. Of seven pieces in the National Gallery,
                    including the Avenue at Middelhamis, which some assign to 1689, two are dated
                    1667. A sample of the last of these years is also in the Fitzwilliam museum at
                    Cambridge. The value of Hobbema’s pictures may be gathered from this that the
                    Watermill bought from the Schneider collection in 1876 for the Antwerp museum
                    cost 100,000 francs (£4000), whilst a smaller landscape in the Hodshen sale at
                    Amsterdam was knocked down to Sir R. Wallace for 49,500 florins, or £4300. The
                    Brussels gallery also bought a Hobbema in 1874 for 60,000 francs. Amongst the
                    masterpieces in private hands in England may be noticed two landscapes in
                    Buckingham palace, one belonging to Lord Overstone, two to the Earl of
                    Ellesmere, and one to Mr Walter of Bearwood. On the Continent we register a Wood
                    in the Berlin gallery, a Forest belonging to the duchess of Sagan in Paris, and
                    a Glade in the Louvre. There are other fine Hobbemas in the Arenberg gallery at
                    Brussels and the Belvedere at Vienna. (J. A. C.)</p>
