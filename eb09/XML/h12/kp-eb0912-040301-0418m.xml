                    years amidst a political fermentation which led him to take a deep and absorbing
                    interest in politics. But though he approved of the French Revolution, his
                    sympathies were with the more moderate party, and he became a member of the
                    “club of 1789,” instituted to support the new form of constitutional monarchy in
                    opposition to the anarchical attempts of the Jacobins. Even at this early period
                    he displayed his mastery of the principles of finance by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discours</hi> delivered in August 1790 before this society, in regard to the
                    issue of assignats by the Government. The <hi rend="italic">Discoτιrs</hi>
                    gained him considerable reputation, but as it failed in its purpose he withdrew
                    from the society. Iu January 1793 he was appointed by Mr Dundas to an office
                    created with a view to direct the execution of the Aliens Act; and in the
                    discharge of his delicate duties he manifested such ability that in 1795 he was
                    appointed under secretary in the colonial department. In the following year he
                    entered parliament as member for Morpeth, but for a considerable period he took
                    scarcely any part in the debates. On the retirement of Pitt in 1801 he resigned
                    office, and after contesting Dover unsuccessfully he withdrew for a time into
                    private life. Having in 1804 been chosen to represent Liskeard, he was on the
                    restoration of the Pitt ministry appointed secretary of the treasury, holding
                    office till the dissolution of the ministry after the death of Pitt in January
                    1806. After being elected for Harwich in 1807, he accepted the same office under
                    the duke of Portland, but he withdrew from the ministry along with Canning in
                    1809. In the following year he published a pamphlet on the currency system,
                    which confirmed his reputation as the ablest financier of his time; but his
                    free-trade principles did not accord with those of his party. When in 1814 he
                    re-entered the public service, it was only as chief commissioner of woods and
                    forests, but his influence was from this time very great in the commercial and
                    financial legislation of the country. He took a prominent part in the corn-law
                    debates of 1814 and 1815; and in 1819 he presented a memorandum to Lord
                    Liverpool advocating a large reduction in the unfunded debt, and explaining a
                    method for the resumption of cash payments, which was embodied in the Act passed
                    the same year. In the following year he was named a member of the committee
                    appointed to inquire into the causes of the agricultural distress then
                    prevailing in the country, and the proposed relaxation of the corn laws embodied
                    in the report was understood to have been chiefly due to his strenuous advocacy.
                    In 1823 he was appointed president of the board of trade and treasurer of the
                    navy, and shortly afterwards he received a seat in the cabinet. In the same year
                    he was returned for Liverpool, having from 1812 represented Chichester. Among
                    the more important legislative changes with which he was principally connected
                    were a reform of the Navigation Acts, admitting other nations to a full equality
                    and reciprocity of shipping duties; the repeal of the labour laws; the
                    introduction of a new sinking fund; the reduction of the duties on manufactures
                    and on the importation of foreign goods, and the repeal of the quarantine
                    duties. In accordance with his suggestion Canning in 1827 introduced a measure
                    on the corn laws proposing the adoption of a sliding scale to regulate the
                    amount of duty. The bill passed the House of Commons, but a misapprehension
                    between Huskisson and the duke of Wellington led to the duke proposing an
                    amendment, the success of which caused the abandonment of the measure by the
                    Government. After the death of Canning in the same year Huskisson accepted the
                    secretaryship of the colonies under Lord Goderich, an office which he continued
                    to hold in the new cabinet formed by the duke of Wellington in the following
                    year. From the beginning the cabinet was rent by internal disputes, and, after
                    succeeding with great <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0419-0404"/> difficulty in inducing the cabinet to agree to a
                    compro mise on the corn laws, Huskisson finally resigned office in May 1829 on
                    account of a difference with his colleagues in regard to the disfranchisement of
                    East Retford. On° the 15th September of the following year he was accidentally
                    killed by a locomotive engine while present at the opening of the Liverpool and
                    Manchester Railway.</p>
