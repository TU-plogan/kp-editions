                <p><label type="entry">HUNDRED</label>, in England, is an ancient territorial
                    division intermediate between the parish or township and the county. Such
                    subordinate districts were also known in different parts of the county as <hi
                    rend="italic">wapentakes, wards,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >shires.</hi> The name <hi rend="italic">wapentake,</hi> which seems to have a
                    distinct reference to the military side of the organization, is generally
                    connected with the Danish occupation, and is said to be found only in the
                    Anglian districts,—Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire,
                    Rutlandshire, and Leicestershire. In some parts of England a further
                    intermediate division is to be found between the hundred and the county. Thus in
                    Yorkshire we have the trithing, or as it is now called the riding, in
                    Lincolnshire the soke, the lathe in Kent, and the rape in Sussex. The origin of
                    these divisions is generally ascribed to the creative genius of Alfred, who,
                    according to the popular theory, divided the country into counties, the county
                    into hundreds, and the hundreds into tithings or towns. The exact opposite would
                    appear to have been the real process, the larger division being formed by the
                    aggregation of the smaller groups. The significance of the name hundred is a
                    question of some difficulty. The simplest theory is the old one that the hundred
                    denoted first the group of a hundred families into which the community was
                    divided, and’then the district occupied by the group, just as the tithing
                    represents ten families and the district which the ten families occupy. Another
                    view is that the hundred is a term of measurement only, denoting a hundred hides
                    of land. Or again, it has been supposed to be the district from which the
                    complement of one hundred warriors was furnished to the host. The hundred as a
                    group of persons is a well-known feature of the constitution of the German
                    tribes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as described by Tacitus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">centeni</hi><hi rend="italic">ex singulis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pagis</hi> who formed the army, and the <hi rend="italic">centeni</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ex plebe comites</hi> who acted as assessors to the chiefs. The
                    hundred as a territorial division in later times is equally common. The real
                    connexion between them is a matter of conjecture. “It is very probable that the
                    colonists of Britain arranged themselves in hundreds of warriors; it is not
                    probable that the country was carved into equal districts. The only conclusion
                    that seems reasonable is that under the name of geographical hundreds we have
                    the variously-sized <hi rend="italic">pagi</hi> or districts in which the
                    hundred warriors settled, the boundaries of these being determined by other
                    causes” (Stubbs’s <hi rend="italic">Constitutional History,</hi> vol. i.). As a
                    territorial division, the hundred like the shire and the parish had its
                    appropriate moot or court, of which the lords, the priest, and four
                    representatives of the parish were members, and in which a specially selected
                    body of twelve appears to have been charged with active judicial functions. The
                    two leading features of the English constitution—representation and trial by
                    jury—thus appear in germ at least in the old constitution of the hundred.</p>
                <p>The hundred is now for most of its ancient purposes an obsolete division. The
                    hundred courts were for the most part extinguished by a section in the County
                    Courts Act, 1867, which enacts that no action which can be brought in a county
                    court shall thenceforth be brought in a hundred court, or other inferior court,
                    not being a court of record. The court of record for the hundred of Salford is
                    an example of the survival of this ancient jurisdiction,</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most important of the surviving duties of the hundred is its
                    liability to make good damages occasioned by rioters. The 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 31
                    consolidates and amends the laws relating to remedy against the hundred. The
                    principal section enacts that, if any church, house, or other building or
                    section shall be feloniously pulled down or destroyed, the hundred or other
                    district in the nature of a hundred by whatever name it shall be denominated
                    shall be liable to yield full compensation to the persons damnified, provided
                    such person, or his servant having charge of the property, appear before a
                    justice of the peace within seven days after the commission of the offence, to
                    give information. Actions of this kind must be commenced within three months
                    after the offence. The 17 and 18 Vict. c. 104 (Merchant Shipping Act) gives the
                    same remedy in the case of a wrecked ship if plundered by a riotous assemblage,
                    the hundred in or nearest to which the offence was committed being made
                    liable.</p>
