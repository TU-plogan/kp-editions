                    Hissâr, Rohtak, and Sirsa. Area, 8478 square miles. Population (1868),
                    1,232,435</p></note> in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, India, lying
                    between 28° 36' and 29° 49' N. lat., and between 75° 16' and 76° 22' E. long. It
                    is bounded on the N. and N.W. by the Patiâla state and a small portion of the
                    British district of Sirsa, on the E. and S. by the territory of Jhind and the
                    British district of Rohtak, and on the W. by the deserts of Bikaner. Area, 3539
                    square miles; population (1868), 484,681.</p>
                <p>Hissât forms the western border district of the great Bikaner desert, and
                    consists for the most part of sandy plains dotted with shrub and brushwood, and
                    broken by undulations towards the south, which rise into hills of rock like
                    islands out of a sea of sand. The Ghaggar is its only river, whose supply is
                    uncertain, depending much on the fall of rain in the lower Himâlayas; its
                    overflow in times of heavy rain is caught near Fatehâbâd and Murakhera by <hi
                    rend="italic">foils,</hi> which dry up in the hot season. A canal, known as the
                    Western Jumna Canal, crosses the district from east to west, irrigating 54
                    villages. The soil is in places hard and clayey, and difficult to till; but when
                    sufficiently irrigated it is highly productive. Old mosques and other buildings
                    exist in parts of the district.</p>
                <p>Rice is the staple crop of the district. In favourable seasons, cotton is
                    extensively grown in lands irrigated by the Western Jumna Canal. In 1872-73,
                    1,431,541 acres were under tillage, out of an assessed area of 2,265,428 acres.
                    Hissâr produces a breed of milk-white oxen, 17 or 18 hands in height, which are
                    in great request for the carriages of nativos. The district has always been
                    subject to famine. The first calamity of this kind of which we have authentic
                    record was the famine of 1783; since then there have been several more or less
                    serious failures of the crops.</p>
                <p>The principal exports are oil-seeds, gram, grains, copper and brass utensils,
                    hides, and a little cotton; the imports —salt, sugar, fine rice, cotton goods of
                    English make, spices, and iron. The exports are double the imports in value. The
                    rural manufactures comprise coarse cotton cloth, vessels made of prepared skins,
                    and copper and brass vessels. The annual out-turn of rough saltpetre is
                    estimated at 450 <hi rend="italic">maunds.</hi> The trade of the district
                    centres in Bhawâni, where nine lines of traffic converge. The main road, about
                    50 feet wide, unmetalled, traverses the district, passing through Hânsi and
                    Hissâr towns; fourteen other roads supply communication. The census of 1868
                    returned the population at 484,681 (males, 266,847; females, 217,834). The
                    Hindus numbered 373,937; Mahometans, 102,928; Sikhs, 1812; and “others,” 6004.
                    There are three municipalities, viz., Bhawâni, 32,254; Hissâr, 14,133; and
                    Hânsi, 13,563. The district police numbered 396 men in 1872-73, and the
                    municipal police 174. In the same year there were 50 schools, with 1729
                    scholars. The climate of Hissâr is very dry; hot westerly winds blow from the
                    middle of March till July. The average rainfall for the six years 1867—68 to
                    1872-73 was 14 ’ 57 inches. The principal diseases are fevers and smallpox.
                    Cholera occasionally breaks out. Skin diseases also are common. Government
                    dispensaries are situated at Bhawâni and Hânsi.</p>
                <p>Prior to the Mahometan conquest, the semi-desert tract of which Hissâr district
                    now forms part was the retreat of Chauhân Eâjputs. Towards the end of the 18th
                    century, the Bhattis of Bhattiâna gained ascendency after bloody struggles. To
                    complete the ruin brought on by these conflicts, nature lent her aid in the
                    great famine of 1783. Hissâr passed nominally to the British in 1803, but they
                    could not enforce order till 1810. Early in the mutiny of 1857 Hissâr was wholly
                    lost for a time to British rule, and all Europeans were either murdered or
                    compelled to fly. The Bhattis rose under their hereditary chiefs, and the
                    majority of the Mahometan population followed their example. Before Delhi had
                    been recovered, the rebels were utterly routed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hissâr,</hi> municipal town and administrative headquarters
                    of the above district, 29° 9' 5Γ' N. lat., 75° 45' 55'' E. long.; population
                    (1868), 14,133 (Hindus 9211, Mahometans 4805, Sikhs 34, Christians 83). The town
                    is situated on the Western Jumna Canal, 102 miles W. of Delhi. It was founded in
                    1354 by the emperor Firoz Shâh, who constructed the canal to supply it with
                    water; but this fell into decay during the last century, owing to the constant
                    inroads of marauders. Hissâr was almost completely depopulated during the famine
                    of 1783, but was afterwards occupied by the adventurer George Thomas, who built
                    a fort and collected inhabitants. It contains a cattle farm, both for
                    commissariat purposes and for improving the breed of the province; attached is
                    an estate of 43,287 acres for pasturage. There is an import trade in grain, <hi
                    rend="italic">ghi,</hi> sugar, oil, cotton, tobacco, and English piece goods.
                    The municipal revenue in 1875-76 was J&gt;1229.</p>
