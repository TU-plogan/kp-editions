                    (1793-1864), an American geologist, was born of poor parents at Deerfield,
                    Massachusetts, May 24, 1793. He owed his education chiefly to his own exertions,
                    and was preparing himself to enter Harvard College when he was compelled to
                    interrupt his studies from a weakness in his eyesight. In 1815 he became
                    principal of the academy of his native town; but he resigned this office in 1818
                    in order to study for the ministry. Having been ordained in 1821 pastor of the
                    Congregational church of Conway, Massachusetts, he employed his hours of leisure
                    in making a scientific survey of the western counties of the State. In 1825 he
                    resigned his charge in order to become professor of chemistry and natural
                    history in the newly-founded Amherst College, an institution which owed its
                    early success, if not its continued existence, to his energetic efforts, both in
                    rescuing it from <pb break="no"

                    literary and scientific efficiency. More especially did he render to it
                    invaluable service during the period when he was president, from 1845 to 1854.
                    In 1830 he was appointed State geologist of Massachusetts, and in 1836 to the
                    same office in connexion with the first district of the State of New York. On
                    resigning the presidentship of Amherst College, he was induced to retain his
                    professorship. In 1836 he received the degree of LL.D, from Harvard, and in 1846
                    that of D.D. from Middlebury College. Besides his constant labours in geology,
                    zoology, and botany, Hitchcock took an active interest in agriculture, and in
                    1850 he was sent by the Massachusetts legislature to examine into the methods of
                    the agricultural schools of Europe. In geology his most important achievement
                    was the examination and exposition of the fossil footprints of the Connecticut
                    valley. The collection which he accumulated in connexion with his investigations
                    is contained in the Hitchcock Ichnological Museum of Amherst College, and a
                    description of it was published in 1858 in his report to the Massachusetts
                    legislature on the ichnology of New England. As a writer on geological science,
                    Hitchcock was mainly concerned in determining the connexion between it and
                    religion, and employing its results to explain and support what he regarded as
                    the truths of revelation. He died at Amherst, February 27, 1864.</p>
