                <p>BRITISH HONDURAS is the name given to the English establishment or colony of
                    Belize, on the eastern shore of the peninsula of Yucatan, fronting the Bay of
                    Honduras. It probably derives its name of Belize or Balize from the French <hi
                    rend="italic">balise,</hi> a beacon, as no doubt some signal or light was raised
                    here to guide the freebooters, who at one time infested the bay, to some common
                    rendezvous. Its boundaries, as defined by the convention between Great Britain
                    and Carrera, president of Guatemala, in 1859, were fixed as “commencing at the
                    mouth of the river Sarstoon, in the bay of Honduras, ascending that river to the
                    rapids of Gracias a Dios, thence turning to the right in a straight <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0144-0133"/> line to Garbutt’s Rapids in the river Belize, and
                    thence due north to the Mexican frontier.” These limits give a territory about
                    160 miles long by 60 miles wide at its broadest part, with an area of 7562
                    square miles.</p>
                <p>The approach to the coast is through cays and coral reefs, and is both difficult
                    and dangerous. For some miles inland the ground is low and swampy, thickly
                    covered with mangroves and tropical jungle. Next succeeds a narrow belt of rich
                    alluvial land, not exceeding a mile in width, beyond which, and parallel to the
                    rivers, are vast tracts of sandy, arid land, called “pine ridges,” from the red
                    pine with which they are covered, and which are favourite resorts of wild
                    animals. Further inland these give place to what are called “cahoon ridges,”
                    with a deep, rich soil covered with myriads of palm trees. Next come broad
                    savannas, studded with clumps of trees, through which the streams descending
                    from the mountains wind in every direction. The mountains themselves rise in a
                    succession of ridges parallel to the coast. The first are the Manatee Hills,
                    from 800 to 1000 feet high; and beyond these are the Cockscomb Mountains, which
                    are about 4000 feet high.</p>
                <p>No less than sixteen streams, large enough to be called rivers, descend from
                    these mountains and crests to the sea, between the Hondo and Sarstoon. Behind
                    the Cockscomb range there is a succession of valleys and hills, with a varied
                    elevation of from 1200 to 3300 feet above the level of the sea. This tract, of
                    which but little is known, consists of open, grassy lands, with interesting
                    park-like scenery, and could no doubt support a large number of cattle, as all
                    the conditions of climate, &amp;c., are most favourable.</p>
                <p>Many aboriginal remains are found, such as fortified hills, crumbling walls, and
                    buildings subsiding into ruins, The ruins of extensive cities, with monoliths,
                    statues, and carved stones of fine finish are said to be hidden among the yet
                    unexplored forests. They are all, however, more or less similar to the remains
                    found in the neighbouring states of Honduras and Yucatan, and doubtless are the
                    work of the same race or races. The mineral resources of the colony have been
                    but little developed. There are, however, among the hills many indications of
                    gold, silver, and coal.</p>
                <p>The climate generally is hot and damp, but favourably influenced by the trade
                    winds. The mean temperature for 1878 was 79’75° Fahr.; the rainfall for the same
                    year was 105*49 inches, which, however, was remarkably high. The country is not
                    troubled by hurricanes, nor has it suffered from earthquakes. It has never been
                    afflicted by epidemics, except cholera. Yellow fever occurs, but only
                    sporadically. The climate is superior to that of Jamaica and the other West
                    Indian Islands, and the high grounds of the interior are unquestionably
                    healthy.</p>
                <p>The population is mainly negro, introduced originally as slaves, whence has
                    sprung a hybrid race from intermixture with Europeans and Indians. These are
                    engaged in cutting mahogany and dyewoods, and in fishing. As woodmen they are
                    most efficient, and no class or race of men has been able to excel them. A few
                    only cultivate the soil. There are no aboriginal tribes within the limits of
                    Belize, and of the pure Indians there are but few, belonging principally to the
                    tribes of Yucatan. There are some Carib settlements. The scanty white population
                    is •engaged in commerce, and on the sugar plantations. The total population in
                    1871 was 24,710, of which 12,603 were males and 12,107 females, against a total
                    of 25,635 in 1861, showing a decrease of 925, which can be accounted for from
                    the fact that while the political troubles in the adjacent states caused many of
                    their citizens to take refuge here, these, on the troubles being settled,
                    returned to their homes.</p>
                <p>The government is in the hands of a lieutenant-governor, with an executive and
                    legislative council; and there are the usual judicial establishment, a lands
                    title registry office, a public hospital, a lunatic asylum, and an alms-house.
                    There is also an agricultural board for distributing information relative to the
                    cultivation of suitable products, &amp;c. The town of Belize, at the mouth of
                    the river of the same name, has ordinarily about 6000 inhabitants; but the
                    number is more than doubled during the Christmas holidays, when the mahogany
                    cutters come in. The dwellings of the wealthy inhabitants are large and
                    commodious. Besides the Government houses, court-house, barracks, and jail,
                    there are several churches, Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian.
                    There are also some large and costly fireproof warehouses. The place was
                    formerly important from being the commercial entrepôt and depot of the
                    neighbouring Spanish states of Yucatan, Guatemala, and Honduras; but this source
                    of prosperity has been mainly dried up, from the opening of direct communication
                    between several of these states and the United States and Europe, and from the
                    diversion of trade on the Pacific to Panama. The principal product of the
                    country is mahogany, of which the export for many years was 20,000 tons
                    annually, but the demand for it is said to be diminishing. Its logwood ranks
                    high, and from 14,000 to 15,000 tons are exported annually. Besides these, it
                    produces rosewood, sapodilla, Santa Maria, and numerous other woods of value.
                    The cahoon or coyol palm is abundant, producing clusters of nuts, from which is
                    extracted a valuable oil. Several varieties of cotton are produced, some of
                    which are of superior quality. Sarsaparilla and vanilla are found in the
                    interior. The animals of the country comprise many furbearing species, as
                    ounces, panthers, &lt;tc., and the forests abound with various species of
                    monkeys. Manatees and alligators are found in the lagoons and rivers. Among the
                    birds are turkeys, ducks, macaws, parrots, pelicans, and humming-birds. There is
                    also a small black bottle fly, whose bite is most venomous, and which, with the
                    wood-tick, is a source of great annoyance in the forest. There are also several
                    species of venomous snakes and scorpions. Fishes of many varieties are
                    plentiful, as are also turtles, lobsters, and other shell-fish. Cattle and
                    horses are kept in sufficient numbers for all needful purposes. Present
                    statistical information indicates, instead of improvement in the colony, a
                    considerable falling off during the past ten or fifteen years. Its sugar
                    plantations are, however, in a flourishing condition, having increased in their
                    yearly product from 4035 cwt. in 1860 to 38,667 cwt. in 1877. The.rate of duty
                    on the principal articles of import is an average of about 10 per cent.,
                    principally <hi rend="italic">ad valorem.</hi> Machinery, coal, and books are
                    imported free. The gross amount of revenue for 1877 was £41,588, against £27,398
                    in 1863. The public expenditure for the same year was £39,939, and the public
                    debt £5041, the latter showing a decrease of £34,000 in nine years. The total
                    tonnage of all kinds entered and cleared in 1877, exclusive of that employed in
                    the coasting trade, was 73,974 tons, of which 46,168 tons were British. The
                    value of imports, including bullion and specie, for the ten years ending 1877
                    was £1,781,175, and for that year £165,756, of which £84,540 came from Great
                    Britain. The exports for 1877 amounted to £124,503, of which £94,548 worth of
                    domestic produce went to Great Britain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—"</hi> Her Majesty’s Settlement in the Bay of
                    Honduras,” as the territory was formerly styled in official documents, owes its
                    origin to logwood-cutters who frequented the coast of Yucatan and Central
                    America, after the decline of piracy in the sea of the Antilles. Most of these
                    had been free companions, and were well acquainted with the coast. The district
                    was rich in dyewoods, and became a principal resort of the English cutters.
                    Although thus industriously occupied, they so far retained their old habits as
                    to make frequent descents on the logwood establishments of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0145-0134"/> Spaniards, whose attempts to expel them were
                    generally successfully resisted. The most formidable of these was made by the
                    Spaniards in April 1754, when, in consequence of the difficulty of approaching
                    the position from the sea, an expedition, consisting of 1500 men, was organized
                    inland at the town of Peten. As it neared the coast, it was met by 250 English,
                    and completely routed. The logwoodcutters were not again disturbed for a number
                    of years, and their position had become so well established that, in the treaty
                    of 1763, between England and Spain, the former power, while agreeing to demolish
                    “all fortifications which English subjects had erected in the Bay of Honduras,”
                    nevertheless insisted on a clause in favour of the cutters of logwood, that
                    “they or their workmen were not tobe disturbed or molested, under any pretext
                    whatever, in their said places of cutting aud loading logwood; and for this
                    purpose they may build without hindrance and occupy without interruption the
                    houses and magazines necessary for their families and effects.” They had also
                    assured to them the full enjoyment of these advantages and powers in the Spanish
                    coasts and territories. To insure the observance of this treaty, the British
                    Government sent out Sir William Burnaby, who not only settled the limits within
                    which the English were to confine their wood-cutting, but also drew up for their
                    government a code of regulations or laws known as the “Burnaby Code.” Successful
                    in their contests with the Spaniards, and now strengthened by the recognition of
                    the crown, the British settlers assumed a corresponding high tone, and, it is
                    alleged, made fresh encroachments on the Spanish territory. The Spaniards,
                    alarmed and indignant, and asserting that the settlers not only abused the
                    privileges conceded to them by the treaty, but were engaged in smuggling and
                    other illicit practices, organized a large force, and on September 15, 1779,
                    suddenly attacked and destroyed the establishment, taking the inhabitants
                    prisoners to Merida, and afterwards to Havana, where most of them died. The
                    survivors were liberated in 1782, and allowed to go to Jamaica. For two or three
                    years the establishment seems to have been abandoned, but in 1783 a part of the
                    original settlers, with a considerable body of new adventurers, revisited the
                    place, and were soon actively engaged in cutting woods. On September 3d of that
                    year anew treaty was signed between Great Britain and Spain, in which it was
                    expressly agreed that his Britannic Majesty’s subjects should have “the right of
                    cutting, loading, and carrying away logwood in the district lying between the
                    river Wallis or Belize and Rio Hondo, taking the course of these two rivers for
                    unalterable boundaries.” These concessions “were not to be considered as
                    derogating from the rights of sovereignty of the king of Spain” over the
                    district in question, and all the English dispersed in the Spanish territories
                    were to concentrate themselves within the district thus defined within eighteen
                    months. Affairs, notwithstanding the explicit stipulations of the treaty, do not
                    seem to have proceeded favourably; for, three years after, a new treaty was
                    made, in which the king of Spain makes an additional grant of territory,
                    embracing the area between the rivers Sibun or Jabon and Belize, so that
                    collectively the grants embraced the entire coast between the river Sibun in
                    lat. 17° 20' on the south and the Rio Hondo in lat. 18° 30' on the north, a
                    coast-line of about 90 miles, with the adjacent islands and bays. But these
                    extended limits were coupled with still more rigid restrictions. It is not to be
                    supposed that a population composed of so wayward and lawless a set of men at a
                    distance from England was remarkably exact in its observance of the letter or
                    spirit of the treaty of 1786. They seem to have given great annoyance to their
                    Spanish neighbours, who eagerly availed themselves of the breaking out of war
                    between the two countries in 1796 to concert a formidable attack on Belize, with
                    a view to the complete annihilation of the establishment. They concentrated a
                    force of 2000 men at Campeachy, which, under the command of General O’Neill, set
                    sail in thirteen vessels for Belize, and arrived off that place July 10,1798.
                    The settlers, in anticipation of their approach, and aided by the English sloop
                    of war “Merlin,” had strongly fortified a small island in the harbour, called St
                    George’s Cay, whence they maintained a determined and effectual resistance
                    against the Spanish forces, which, after a contest of two days’ duration, were
                    obliged to abandon their object and retire to Campeachy. This was the last
                    attempt to dislodge the English. The defeat of the Spanish attempt of 1798 has
                    been adduced as an act of conquest, thereby permanently establishing British
                    sovereignty. But those who take this view overlook the important fact that, in
                    1814, by a new treaty with Spain, the nrovisinns of that of 1786 were revived.
                    They forget also that until possibly within a few years the British Government
                    never laid claim to any rights acquired in virtιιe of the successful defence;
                    for so late as 1817-19 the Acts of Parliament relating to Belize always refer to
                    it as “a settlement, lor certain purposes, under the protection of his Majesty.”
                    After the independence of the Spanish American provinces, Great Britain sought
                    to secure her rights by incorporating the provisions of the treaty of 1786 in
                    all her treaties with the new states. It was, in fact, incorporated in her
                    treaty with Mexico in 1826, in the project of a treaty which she submitted to
                    Senor Zebadua, the representative of the republic of Central America in London
                    in 1831, and also in the project of a treaty with New Grenada in 1825. Great
                    Britain was, therefore, without any rights in Belize beyond those conveyed. by
                    the treaties already quoted, which define with the greatest precision the area
                    within which these rights might be exercised. But it appears from a despatch of
                    Sir George Grey, colonial secretary, dated in 1836, that claims had then been
                    set up to an additional wide extent of territory, including the entire coast as
                    far south as the river Sarstoon, and as far inland as the meridian of Garbutt’s
                    Falls on the river Belize. This anomalous state of things has no doubt had a
                    prejudicial influence on the prosperity of Belize; but while Great Britain’s
                    right of sovereignty might be questioned, it cannot be doubted that the
                    enterprise of her subjects has rescued a desolate coast from the savage dominion
                    of nature, and carried industry and civilization where none existed before, and
                    where, if left to the control of the Spanish race, none would have existed to
                    this day. It was perhaps this consideration that induced Mr Clayton, the
                    American secretary of state, to consent to the exclusion of Belize from the
                    operation of the convention of 1850 between Great Britain and the United States,
                    whereby both powers bound themselves not to occupy, fortify, or colonize any
                    part of Central America.</p>
