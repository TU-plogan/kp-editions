                    met with in India and South Africa, these effects are greatly intensified, so
                    that on the one hand the ivory scales of thermometers, quill pens, and other
                    objects curl up, articles of furniture open at the joints and split up, and the
                    grass which covers the soil is reduced to a state of tinder; and on the other
                    hand, everything becomes so permeated with moisture that, even in the interior
                    of houses, furniture, books, and wearing apparel become sodden with wet. These
                    different effects depend on the states of the air as regards the quantity of
                    aqueous vapour diffused through it taken in connexion with the temperature,
                    these varying from the completest possible saturation of the air, which is of
                    occasional occurrence in the rainy season of some tropical climates, to that
                    extreme desiccation of the air which sometimes happens in Great Britain in
                    spring, but more completely and frequently in such dry summer climates as that
                    of the Punjaub.</p>
                <p>A large number of substances, such as sugar, flour, and bread, possess the
                    property of absorbing moisture, and most gases, as well as air, absorb and
                    retain aqueous vapour. The term <hi rend="italic">hygrometry</hi> is employed to
                    signify the measurement of the degree of dampness of substances, and to denote
                    the processes by which their humidity is ascertained. The term, however, may be
                    considered as restricted to the humidity öf the atmosphere, owing to the
                    paramount importance of that branch of the subject, and the slight and
                    unsatisfactory knowledge we yet possess of the laws of hygrometry of other
                    substances.</p>
                <p>All organic substances contain pores for the conveyance of their juices, and are
                    influenced by the accession of moisture, some of them very markedly so. Every
                    species of wood is liable to these hygrometric changes, the amount of
                    contraction and expansion being much greater across the grain of the wood than
                    lengthways. Hence the panels of doors are fitted into grooves so as to allow of
                    shrinkage, for, if secured at the edges, the panels must inevitably split. The
                    hair of animals is also eminently hygrometric, curling and uncurling as the air
                    becomes drier or moister, and it is because of the peculiar sensations
                    accompanying these hygrometric changes that the cries and behaviour of many of
                    the lower animals furnish valuable prognostications of weather changes.
                    Similarly many manufactured objects, such as paper, cordage, &amp;c., vary in
                    weight, bulk, form, and elasticity with the varying degrees of humidity of the
                    air, and other interesting prognostics have been drawn from these hygrometric
                    changes.</p>
                <p>In the earlier stages of the investigation of the hygrometry of the air, the
                    hygrometric properties of several substances were made use of as instruments of
                    observation. Of these may be named the twisted Indian grass <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Oobeena</hi><pb break="no"

                    Captain Kater on account of its remarkable property of twisting and untwisting
                    according to the dampness of the air; a slip of whalebone cut across the fibres,
                    used by De Luc; and the hygrometer of Saussure, which was formed of a hair from
                    which the oily matter had been previously removed, and which stretches when
                    moist and contracts when dry. Experience has, however, shown that none of these
                    hygrometers are satisfactory instruments, seeing they give inconsistent results,
                    and are liable when in use to great and uncertain changes. Hence, while they
                    serve to give the roughest idea of the state of the air as regards moisture,
                    they have fallen into disuse as accurate instruments of observation of the
                    hygrometry of the atmosphere. But in the intensely cold climates of Russia and
                    Siberia, the hair hygrometer still continues to be used as an instrument of
                    observation; and when we consider the tediousness and difficulty of making
                    hygrometric observations with the hygrometer in most general use when the
                    temperature of the air descends below the freezing-point of water, the hair
                    hygrometer should perhaps be considered as good an instrument as is available to
                    put into the hands of ordinary observers in times of low temperature.</p>
                <p>The most accurate hygrometers are those which are constructed, not as the above,
                    on the principle of absorption of vapour, but on the principles of condensation
                    or evaporation. The well-known fact that the temperature of a wet body is lower
                    than that of a dry one when under the same atmospheric conditions was applied by
                    Sir John Leslie to measure the humidity of the air. Leslie’s hygrometer (fig.
                    1), which is an adaptation of his differential thermometer, is formed by uniting
                    two tubes having a ball blown on the end of each, into which some coloured
                    sulphuric ether has been previously introduced. When both bulbs are at the same
                    temperature, the fluid stands at the zero of the scale, but when one of them is
                    covered with wetted paper or muslin the instrument shows the depression of
                    temperature of the wetted bulb. In order to ascertain the quantity of moisture
                    corresponding to the reading of a Leslie’s hygrometer, we must deduct from the
                    total quantity of moisture which the air of the temperature at the time of
                    observation is capable of holding the deficiency due to the degree of cooling
                    shown by the hygrometer.</p>
                <p>As no air is ever absolutely dry, but contains more or less moisture, it is
                    evident that if any mass of air be cooled sufficiently it may be made to deposit
                    its moisture. A familiar example of the condensation of vapour is seen in the
                    formation of dew on a tumbler filled with cold water and brought into a warm
                    room. This dew is caused by the deposition of moisture from the air in contact
                    with the cold surface of the glass, which is cooled down below the point of
                    saturation. The temperature of the glass at the instant dew begins to form on
                    its surface is termed the dew-point, which corresponds with the point of
                    saturation of the air.</p>
                <p>Daniell’s and Regnault’s hygrometers are constructed on the principle of this
                    simple phenomenon, various contrivances being used for lowering the temperature
                    quickly to any point that may be desired, and for observing with requisite
                    precision the temperature at which the dew begins to form. In both cases ether
                    is employed to lower the temperature.</p>
                <p>Daniell’s hygrometer consists of a glass tube bent at right angles at two points
                    with a bulb at each extremity, one bulb being of black and the other of clear
                    glass, the latter covered with muslin. The liquid within the bulbs is ether,
                    which at the time of being sealed is made to boil for the purpose of expelling
                    the air. If the temperature of the two bulbs be made to differ from each other,
                    all the ether is transferred from the warmer to the colder bulb. In making an
                    observation the whole of the ether is first transferred to the black bulb, and
                    ether is then dropped on the muslin covering outside the clear bulb. This ether
                    quickly evaporates, and in doing so rapidly lowers the temperature of the clear
                    bulb so that the ether inside the black bulb distils over into the clear bulb.
                    The result is a lowering of the temperature of the black bulb, and, as soon as
                    this falls to the temperature of the dew-point of the air where the experiment
                    is conducted, a ring of vapour begins to be formed outside the black bulb, more
                    or less dulling its surface. At this instant a thermometer placed inside the
                    tube with its bulb immersed in the ether filling the black bulb is read, and the
                    reading gives the dew-point of the air at the time.</p>
                <p>Regnault’s hygrometer is a little more complicated than Daniell’s, but its
                    indications are much more trustworthy. It consists (fig. 2) of a glass tube or
                    capsule A, having on the bottom and a little way up a highly polished silver
                    surface, and closed by a cork with two holes. Through one of these holes the
                    stem of a thermometer B passes, having its bulb at the bottom of the silvered
                    capsule, while through the other hole passes a narrow metallic tube C, one end
                    of which opens close to the bottom of the capsule, and the other end may, if
                    desired, be connected with an aspirator or air-pump. In making an observation as
                    much ether is introduced into the capsule A as will cover the bulb of the
                    thermometer, and then by transmitting air through the tube C the ether vapour is
                    withdrawn from the capsule A through another tube D. By this means the
                    temperature of the ether is very rapidly reduced, and since the whole mass of
                    the ether is agitated by the air-bubbles which rise through it from the bottom
                    of the capsule, the cooling of the ether is equal throughout. The thermometer is
                    then read quickly, but to ensure an accuracy to the tenth of a degree a second
                    and a third experiment, conducted more slowly, should be made. As showing the
                    rapidity with which observations can be made with this hygrometer, Henry F.
                    Blanford on one occasion made six observations in six minutes in the dry climate
                    of Secunderabad, when the temperature of the air was 93°, the dewpoint 51°, and
                    the relative humidity consequently 24°. The temperature of the air at the time
                    of observation may be ascertained in the usual way, or by means of the
                    thermometer E, if care be taken that its temperature is unaffected by the
                    proximity of the person of the observer.</p>
                <p>Owing to the expense and great trouble attending the use of hygrometers which
                    give the dew-point directly by condensation, another hygrometer has come into
                    extensive use by which the dew-point is determined indirectly by evaporation.
                    This is August’s hygrometer, sometimes called <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0586-0571"/> Mason’s hygrometer, but more generally known as
                    the dry and wet bulb hygrometer, which has the strong recommendation of being
                    self-acting, and requiring only the readings of the two thermometers in making
                    air observations. This hygrometer (fig. 3) consists of two thermometers <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> similar to each other in all
                    respects except that one of them has a piece of muslin tied closely over the
                    surface of its bulb <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and kept constantly wet by a few
                    threads of cotton which connect it with the water in the vessel <hi
                    rend="italic">d.</hi> The water then which rises from the vessel by capillary
                    attraction spreads over the muslin, and evaporates from its surface with more or
                    less rapidity according to the dryness or moistness of the air; and the greater
                    the dryness of the air the greater is the difference between the observed
                    readings of the dry and the wet thermometers.</p>
                <p>The formula for deducing the hygrometric state of the air from these two
                    observations has been investigated by Professor Apjohn (2 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > τ</hi> rαiW∙ <hi rend="italic">Hoy. Irish Acad.,</hi> vol. xvii.), and has
                    been already described (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Atmosphere,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    32). As it is very troublesome to go through the calculations for each fresh
                    observation, tables have been prepared which give the dewpoint by inspection.
                    The best of these tables in English measures are those of Glaisher, fifth
                    edition, constructed empirically from direct experiments carried on at
                    Greenwich, combined with Regnault’s last revised tables relating to aqueous
                    vapour. There can be but one opinion as to the great service rendered to
                    meteorology by Glaisher in the preparation of these tables, which give results
                    approximately correct for high and moderate humidities and for situations at no
                    great height above the sea; in other words, they may be regarded as accurate for
                    at least such conditions as are presented by the climates of the British
                    Islands. They are, however, insufficient, owing to the comparatively large
                    errors attending their use, for the reduction of observations made in elevated
                    situations and in such arid states of the atmosphere as are of frequent
                    occurrence in India and South Africa. The preparation of such tables remains
                    still a serious desideratum in meteorology; and another desideratum equally
                    important is the introduction of a simple, handy, and accurate method of
                    observing the hygrometry of the air when its temperature descends below the
                    freezing-point of water, some method which would involve only a minimum of
                    manipulative skill and trouble in making an observation. See <hi
