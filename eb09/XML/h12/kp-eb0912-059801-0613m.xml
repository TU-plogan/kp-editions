                    As the name implies (from το <hi rend="italic">υποχόνδριον,</hi> τα <hi
                    rend="italic">υποχόνδρια,</hi> the soft part of the body immediately under the

                    and its symptoms were referred by the ancients, and indeed by physicians down to
                    the time of Cullen, to diseases or derangements of one or more of the abdominal
                    viscera. Cullen classified it amongst nervous diseases, and Falret more fully
                    described it as a morbid condition of the nervous system characterized by
                    depression of feeling and false beliefs as to an impaired state of the health.
                    The subjects of hypochondriasis are for the most part members of families in
                    which hereditary predisposition to degradation of the nervous system is strong,
                    or those who have suffered from morbid influences affecting this system during
                    the earlier years of life. It may be dependent on depressing disease affecting
                    the general system, but under such circumstances it is generally so complicated
                    with the symptoms of hysteria as to render differentiation difficult (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hysteria).</hi> Hypochondriasis is often handed down from one
                    generation to another in its individual form, but it is also not unfrequently to
                    be met with in an individual as the sole manifestation in him of a family
                    tendency to insanity. In its most common form it is manifested by simple false
                    belief as to the state of the health, the intellect being otherwise unaffected.
                    We may instance the “vapourish” woman or the “splenetic” as terms society has
                    applied to its milder manifestations. Such persons are constantly asserting a
                    weak state of health although no palpable cause can be discovered. In its more
                    definite phases pain or uneasy sensations are referred by the patient to some
                    particular region, generally the abdomen, the heart, or the head. That these are
                    subjective is apparent from the fact that the general health is good: all the
                    functions of the various systems are duly performed; the patient eats and sleeps
                    well; and, when any circumstance temporarily overrides the false belief, he is
                    happy and comfortable. No appeal to the reason is of any avail, and the
                    hypochondriac idea so dominates his existence as to render him unable to perform
                    the ordinary duties of life. In its most aggravated form hypochondriasis amounts
                    to actual insanity, delusions arising as to the existence of living creatures in
                    the intestines or brain, or to the effect that the body is materially changed,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> into glass, wood, &amp;c. (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Insanity).</hi> The symptoms of this condition may be remittent; they may even
                    disappear for years, and only return on the advent of some exciting cause.
                    Suicide is occasionally committed in order to escape from the constant misery.
                    As there is nothing to treat, medication is of no avail, and recovery can only
                    be looked for by placing the patient under such morally hygienic conditions as
                    may help to take his mind off himself. More generally he lives through the
                    attack rather than is cured of it.</p>
