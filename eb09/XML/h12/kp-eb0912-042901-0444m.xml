                    the river Indus and Karachi district. The district is a vast alluvial plain, 216
                    miles long and 48 broad. Fertile along the course of the Indus, it degenerates
                    towards the èast into sandy wastes, sparsely populated, and defying cultivation.
                    The monotony is relieved by the fringe of forest which marks the course of the
                    river, and by the avenues of trees that line the irrigation channels which
                    branch eastward from this stream. The south of the district has a special
                    feature in its large natural water-courses (called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dhoras)</hi> and basin-like shallows <hi rend="italic">(phhausj,</hi> which
                    retain the rains for a long time. A limestone range called the Gânga and the
                    pleasant frequency of garden lands break the monotonous landscape. The soil,
                    wherever irrigated, is very fertile. Very few species of the large wild animals
                    are found; among birds, the bustard alone is remarkable. Venomous reptiles
                    abound. The Indus supplies a large variety of fish, one of which, the <hi
                    rend="italic">pala,</hi> is peculiar to the river.</p>

                <p>Of the total area of the district about one-half is uncultivable; 2,300,000 acres
                    are cultivable though not cultivated, and 566,800 are under irrigation.
                    Agriculture is entirely dependent upon artificial irrigation, and is looked upon
                    as a lottery, in which the cultivator stakes a certain amount of labour and
                    seed, and takes his chance of getting a return. If the water rises either too
                    high or not high enough, he loses his crop. There are 317 canals, fifty of which
                    are main channels, and tap the Indus direct; the remainder are connecting
                    branches. The principal crops are wheat, barley, oil-seeds, pulses, vegetables,
                    <hi rend="italic">jodr, bdjra, til,</hi> rice, •cotton, sugar-cane, <hi
                    rend="italic">chana,</hi> hemp, tobacco, water-melons, and indigo. The
                    manufactures of the district maintain the excellence for which they have been
                    famous from early times, namely, that for lacquered work, gold and silver
                    embroidery, striped and brilliant cloths known as <hi rend="italic">süsis</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">rhesis,</hi> and glazed pottery. The manufacture of
                    carpets, silk thread, and gold and silver ornaments is carried on to a large
                    extent; salt also is produced in such quantities as to allow of a considerable
                    exportation. The total number of fairs is 33, and the average attendance about
                    5000. The roads of the district extend to 1925 miles in length, of which 263 are
                    metalled, bridged, and marked with milestones. The ferries number 68; the one at
                    Gidu-Bandar (3⅜ miles from Hyderabad) is a steam ferry connecting Hyderabad with
                    Kotri, on Sind Railway. There are 10 travellers’ bungalows, 16 <hi rend="italic"
                    >dharmsdlds,</hi> 4 dispensaries, a civil and police hospital, a convict
                    hospital, and a charitable dispensary.</p>
                <p>Considerable variations of climate are found within the district. In the north,
                    the hot season of April and May is followed by two months of floods, the rest of
                    the year being cold and dry. In the central divisions, the cold season succeeds
                    the hot without any intervening inundations to graduate the transition; and the
                    change occurs sometimes with such suddenness that, to quote a local saying,
                    “sunstroke and frost-bite are possible in one and the same day.” In the south
                    the temperature is more equable throughout the year, 60° F. and 100° F.
                    representing the extremes. The rainfall is very moderate; and the district is
                    healthy as compared with other parts of India.</p>
                <p>The population is divided as follows :—Mahometans, 560,349; Hindus, 118,652;
                    other creedsand tribes, 44,882;—total, 723,883. Of the Mahometans 373,705, or
                    more than three-fifths, are Sinds. More important, however, as regards social
                    status and personal character, are the Pathâns, found chiefly about Hyderabad
                    and Upper Sind; they number ouly 15,815 persons. As regards occupation, the
                    Hindus of the district may be called the shopkeeping class, the Mahometans the
                    artisan and agricultural.</p>
                <p>The chief revenue and magisterial authority is vested in a collector and
                    magistrate. He is assisted by the four deputy collectors of Hâla, Tando Muhammad
                    Khan, Naushahro, and Hyderabad <hi rend="italic">taluks, of</hi> which the
                    district is composed. The police force is under the charge of a European
                    district superintendent, and comprises a total of 876 men, with 4 inspectors and
                    19 chief constables. The average land revenue for 6 years (1868-74) was
                    £111,655; drug revenue (1873-74), £5304; receipts from the farming of
                    liquorshops (1873—74), £9640; imperial revenue (1874), £144,944; local revenue
                    (1874), £12,434; forests yield an annual revenue of £11,216. The Government
                    boys’ schools numbered 55 in 1874, with 3227 pupils; the girls’ schools 12, with
                    368 pupils. These figures include the returns for the high, normal, engineering,
                    and Anglo-vernacular schools in Hyderabad city.</p>
                <p>The local history of Hyderabad district is so mixed up with that of the province
                    that little could be said of it separately which will not more properly find a
                    place under the history of Sind. The battles of Miani (Meeanee) and Dabo, which
                    decided the fate of Sind in favour of the British, were fought within its
                    limits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hyderabad,</hi> the chief town of the above district, in 25°
                    23' <hi rend="italic">5"</hi> N. lat. and 68° 24' 51" E. long., had in 1872 a
                    population of 35,272, of whom 13,065 were Mahometans, 16,889 Hindus, 367
                    Christians, and 4951 “others.” The municipal area is about 15 square miles. Upon
                    the site of the present fort is supposed to have stood the ancient town of
                    Nerâukot, which in the 8th century submitted to Muhammad Kâsim Sakifi. Its
                    situation near the apex of the delta of the Indus had commended itself to
                    invaders and conquerors of still earlier date. It is identified with Patala, a
                    town which has been connected with a prehistoric Scythian migration into India
                    <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 625 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> ?). Alexander the
                    Great founded or refounded a city called Patala in or near the same place, 325
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and left in it a military settlement. The best
                    archaeological authorities regard the modern Hyderabad as the representative of
                    this Patala of the Greeks. In 1768 the present city was founded by Gliulâm Shâh
                    Kalhora; and it remained the chief town of the province until 1843, when, after
                    the battle of Meeanee, it was surrendered to the British, and the capital
                    transferred to Kurrachee (Karâchi). The city is built on the most northerly
                    hills of the Gânga range, a site of great natural strength. In the fort, which
                    covers an area of 36 acres, are the arsenal of the province, transferred hither
                    from Kurrachee in 1861, and the residences of the ex mirk of Sind. Hyderabad is
                    the centre of all the provincial communications—road, telegraphic, postal. From
                    the earliest times its manufactures—ornamented silks, silver and gold work, and
                    lacquered ware—have been the chief of the province, and in recent times have
                    gained prizes at the industrial exhibitions of Europe. The chief public
                    institutions and buildings are the jail, Government schools, post-office,
                    municipal markets, court houses, civil and police hospital, charitable
                    dispensary, library, travellers’ bungalow, and lunatic asylum. The barracks—
                    occupied by artillery and infantry, European and native— are built in twelve
                    blocks, with hospitals, bazaar, &amp;c., to the north-west of the city. The only
                    noteworthy antiquities are the tombs of the Kabhora and Tâlpur mirs.</p>
