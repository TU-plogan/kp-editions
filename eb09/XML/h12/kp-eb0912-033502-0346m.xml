                    (1630-1721), bishop of Avranches, is the last of those encyclopaedic and massive
                    scholars of whom France produced so many. He left no successor to his omnivorous
                    learning, prodigious memory, and indomitable energy. He was born at Caen of a
                    family formerly Huguenot. He lost both father and mother while still a child,
                    and was brought up by his aunt, wife of the mathematician Gilles Macé, to whom
                    he owed his respect , for science. He says himself that the ardour of study did
                    not possess him in earnest until in early manhood he was reading the <hi
                    rend="italic">Géographie Sacrée</hi> of Bochart, and suddenly became intoxicated
                    with the desire of becoming a scholar. It may be remarked that a youth who was
                    not already studious would hardly be reading such a book. However, the statement
                    means that he began about that time to study not in earnest only but with
                    passion and fury. In Hebrew alone so great was bis industry that he read through
                    the Old Testament in the original no less than four-and-twenty times during his
                    life. At the age of twenty he had already achieved a reputation as one of the
                    most promising scholars of the time. He went at the age of twenty-one to Paris,
                    where he formed a friendship with Gabriel Maude, conservator of the Mazarin
                    library. In the following year Bochart, being invited by Queen Christina to her
                    court at Stockholm, took his friend Huet with him. This journey, in which he saw
                    Leyden, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen, as well as Stockholm, resulted chiefly in the
                    discovery of some fragments of Origen’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on St
                    Matthew,</hi> which gave Huet the idea of editing Origen. On his return to
                    France he assisted at the foundation of the academy of Caen, and shortly
                    afterwards quarrelled with his friend Bochart, who accused him of having
                    suppressed a line in Origen in tho Eucharistic controversy. Shortly afterwards
                    he removed to Paris, where he entered into close relations with Chapelain. At
                    this time arose the famous dispute of Ancients and Moderns. Huet took the side
                    of the Ancients against Charles Perrault and Desmarets. Among his friends at
                    this period were Corrart and Pellisson. His taste for mathematics led him to the
                    study of astronomy, and in 1672 he founded the Academy of Science at Caen. He
                    next turned his attention to anatomy, and, being himself shortsighted, devoted
                    his inquiries mainly to the question of vision and the formation of the eye. In
                    this pursuit he made more than 800 dissections. He theη learned all that was
                    then to be learned in chemistry, and wrote a Latin poem on salt. All this time
                    he was no mere book-worm or recluse, but was haunting the salons of Mlle, de
                    Scudéry and the studios of painters; nor did his scientific researches interfere
                    with his classical studies, for during this time he was discussing with Bochart
                    the origin of certain medals, and was learning Syriac and Arabic under the J
                    esuit Parvilliers. N or did he neglect the lighter walks of letters. He
                    translated the pastorals of Longus, wrote a tale called <hi rend="italic">Diane
                    de Castro,</hi> and defended in a treatise on the origin of romance the reading
                    of fiction. Then, being appointed assistant tutor to the Dauphin, he edited with
                    the assistance of Anne Lefèvre, afterwards Madame Dacier, the well-known edition
                    of the classics <hi rend="italic">ad usum Delphini.</hi> He also continued to
                    work upon his edition of Origen, and issued one of his greatest works, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Demonstration</hi><hi rend="italic">Évangélique.</hi> It was at
                    the age of forty-six that he took orders, a step which he had contemplated for
                    some years. Two years later the king gave him the abbey of Aunay, where he wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Questions</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Aunay, sur l'accord de
                    la Foi et de la Raison,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Critique de la Philosophie de
                    Descartes,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire du
                    Cartésianisme,</hi> his dissertation on the site of the terrestrial paradise,
                    and his discussion with Boileau on the Sublime. In 1685 he was made bishop of
                    Soissons, but after waiting for installation for four years he took the
                    bishopric of Avranches instead. He exchanged the cares of his bishopric for what
                    he thought would be the easier chair of the Abbey of Fontenay, but there he was
                    vexed with continual law suits. At length he retired to the Jesuits’ House in
                    the Rue Saint Antoine at Paris, where he ended his days, in 1721, amidst
                    incessant labours maintained to the end, at the age of ninety-one. His great
                    library and manuscripts, after being bequeathed to the Jesuits, were bought by
                    the king for the royal library.</p>
                <p>It is impossible here to enter upon an estimate of the place in philosophy,
                    literature, and scholarship now occupied by this remarkable and omnivorous
                    student. It has been disputed whether a writer who could so strenuously advocate
                    the claim of philosophy could have been at the same time an orthodox believer.
                    Perhaps like many other men Huet separated his creed from his philosophy, and
                    while he argued on Descartes forgot that he was a bishop. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">lluetiana</hi> will be found the most ready materials for arriving
                    at an idea of his prodigious labours, exact memory, and wide scholarship. His
                    own autobiography, found in his <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de rebus ad</hi><hi rend="italic">eum pertinentibus,</hi> was
                    translated into English by Dr Aiken in 1726. It remains to be said that he owed
                    the preservation of his faculties to extreme old’age, and perhaps the
                    prolongation of his life, to the rigid observance of a spare diet which he began
                    at the age of forty, dining moderately, and taking no other supper than a little
                    bouillon.</p>
