                    given to all the birds of the Family <hi rend="italic">Bucerotidoe</hi> of
                    modern ornithologists, from the extraordinary horn-like excrescence <hi
                    rend="italic">(epithema)</hi> developed on the bill of most of the species,
                    though to which of them it was first applied seems doubtful. Among classical
                    authors Pliny had heard of such animals, and mentions them <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hist. Hat.,</hi> lib. x. cap. lxx.) under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tragopan</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he deemed their existence fabulous,
                    comparing them with <hi rend="italic">Pegasi</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gryphones—</hi> in the words of Holland, his translator (vol. i. p. 296)—“I
                    thinke the same of the Tragopanades, which many men affirme to bee greater than
                    the Aegle; having crooked homes like a Ram on either side of the head, of the
                    colour of yron, and the head onely red.” Yet this is but an exaggerated
                    description of some of the species with which doubtless his informants had an
                    imperfect acquaintance. Mediaeval writers found Pliny’s bird to be no fable, for
                    specimens of the beak of one species or another seem occasionally to have been
                    brought to Europe, where they were preserved in the cabinets of the curious, and
                    thus Aldrovandus was able to describe pretty fairly and to figure <hi
                    rend="italic">(Orηithologia,</hi> lib. xii. cap. xx. tab. x. fig. 7) one of them
                    under the name of “<hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros Avisf</hi> though the rest of
                    the bird was wholly unknown to him. When the exploration of the East Indies had
                    extended further, more examples reached Europe, and the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Corvus</hi><hi rend="italic">Indicus cornutus</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,,</hi> of Bontius became fully recognized by Willughby and Ray,
                    under the title of the “Horned Indian Raven or <hi rend="italic">Topau</hi>
                    called the Rhinocerot Bird.” Since the time of those excellent ornithologists
                    our knowledge of the Hornbills has been steadily increasing, but it must be
                    confessed that in regard to many points there is still great lack of precise
                    information, and accordingly the completion of Mr Elliot’s “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Monograph of the</hi> Bucerotidae” (now in course of publication) is most
                    earnestly to be desired, for therein it is to be hoped that all questions
                    respecting their history and classification may be fully treated. At present
                    great diversity of opinion prevails as to how many real genera the Family
                    comprises, or how many species. The group, though no doubt ought to be
                    entertained as to its limits,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Such genera as <hi rend="italic">Eurycerοs, Scythrops,</hi>

                    ornithologists, and therefore, apart from the merest superficial characters, the
                    difference of the several sections which it includes has never been properly
                    explained, nor have their distinctions been placed on a firm basis. Some authors
                    appear to have despaired of dividing it satisfactorily, and have left all the
                    described species in the Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic">Buceros,</hi> as for
                    example, Professor Schlegel <hi rend="italic">(Cat.</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">des Ρays Bas,</hi> Buceros); others have split that
                    genus into more than a score—a number which seems to be quite unnecessary.
                    Sundevall <hi rend="italic">(Tentamen,</hi> pp. 96, 97), with his usual caution,
                    has restrained himself to the recognition of three genera, but it is
                    unquestionable that more should reasonably be admitted, though the present
                    writer is not prepared to state how many are required.</p>
                <p>The first genus admitted by Sundevall is <hi rend="italic">Rhiηοplαx,</hi> which
                    seems properly to contain but one species, the <hi rend="italic">Buccrοs vigil,
                    B.</hi><hi rend="italic">scutatus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">B. galcakusο{</hi>
                    authors, commonly known as the Helmet-Hornbill, a native of Sumatra and Borneo.
                    This is easily distinguished by having the front of its nearly vertical and
                    slightly convex <hi rend="italic">eρithcma</hi> composed of a solid mass of
                    horn<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apparently
                    correlated with this structure is the curious thickening of the “prosencephalic
                    median septum” of the cranium as also of that which divides the “prosencephalic”
                    from the “mesencephalic chamber,” noticed by Professor Owen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cat. Osteol. Ser.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">Roy. Coll.
                    Surg. England,</hi> i. p. 287); while the solid horny mass is further
                    strengthened by a backing of bony props, directed forwards and meeting its base
                    at right angles. This last singular arrangement, which is not perceptible in the
                    skull of any other species examined by the present writer, does not seem to have
                    been described.</p></note> instead of a thin coating of the light and cellular
                    structure found in the others. So dense and hard is this portion of the “helmet”
                    that Chinese and Malay artists carve figures on its surface, or cut it
                    transversely into plates, which from their agreeable colouring, bright yellow
                    with a scarlet rim, are worn as brooches or other ornaments. This bird, which is
                    larger than a Raven, is also remarkable for its long graduated tail, having the
                    two middle feathers nearly twice the length of the rest. Nothing is known of its
                    habits. Its head was figured by Edwards more than a century ago, but little else
                    had been seen of it until 1801, when Latham described the plumage from a
                    specimen in the British Museum, and the first figure of the whole bird from an
                    example in the Museum at Calcutta was published by Hardwieke in 1823 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Linn. Society,</hi> xiv. pl. 23). Yet more than twenty
                    years elapsed before French naturalists became acquainted with it. Under <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhinoplax</hi> Sundevall places the <hi rend="italic">Buceros
                    cornutus</hi> of Raffles; but this would seem to be a wrong position for that
                    species, the type of Bonaparte’s genus <hi rend="italic">Berenicornis,</hi>
                    since it does not appear to possess a frontlet of solid horn.</p>
                <p>Sundevall divides the genus <hi rend="italic">Buceros</hi> into three sections,
                    of which one, <hi rend="italic">Buceros</hi> proper, contains the species having
                    the <hi rend="italic">epithema</hi> developed to its greatest extent, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">B. rhinoceros, B. hydro-</hi><hi rend="italic">corax, B.
                    bicornis,</hi> and others, while the remaining sections have little or no <hi
                    rend="italic">epithema,</hi> and one of them has the throat feathered. This last
                    includes the African forms which seem to belong to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Toccus</hi> of Lesson, while the other comprises the Oriental species
                    exemplified by Mr Hodgson's genus <hi rend="italic">Aceros∙,</hi> but the
                    arrangement cannot be deemed wlιolly satisfactory, and must be regarded only as
                    an approach to a better. The presence or absence of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >epithema</hi> may indeed be considered in distinguishing genera; but among
                    those that possess it, seeing that its development is to a great degree
                    dependent upon age and perhaps sex (this last being uncertain), its size and
                    shape hardly afford good generic characters, and, though the group assigned by
                    Sundevall to <hi rend="italic">Buceros</hi> proper doubtless requires further
                    separation, some less superficial distinctions must be pointed out than those
                    which have been taken as sufficient to establish many of the “genera” of this
                    family suggested bv several ornithologists. Again, in the grouping of those
                    forms which possess little or no <hi rend="italic">epithema</hi> sound
                    characters are equally wanting for the divisions as yet set forth, and until
                    further investigations have been made the limits of even the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Accros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Toccus</hi> cannot be laid down.
                    Tickell in his manuscript <hi rend="italic">Birds of India</hi> (in the library
                    of the Zoological Society of London) divides the Hornbills of that country into
                    two genera only, <hi rend="italic">Buceros</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aceros,</hi> remarking that the birds of the former fly by alternately flapping
                    their wings and sailing, while those of the latter fly by regular flapping
                    only.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The noise made by

                    Observer,</hi> 1863, pp. 310 <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Bucerotidoe,</hi> and it is quite possible that these differences may be
                    correlated with TickelΓs observations so as to furnish, when more is known about
                    these birds, a better mode of classing them, and the same may be said of those
                    of the African group containing the genus <hi rend="italic">Toccus</hi> and its
                    allies.</p>
                <p>Lastly, we have the genus <hi rend="italic">Bucorιnιs,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bucorax</hi> as some call it, confined to Africa, and containing at least two
                    and perhaps more species, distinguishable by their longer legs and shorter toes,
                    the Ground-Hornbills of English writers, in contrast to all the preceding, which
                    are chiefly arboreal in their habits, and when not flying move by short leaps or
                    hops, while the members of this group walk and run with facility. From the days'
                    of Bruce at least there are few African travellers who have not met with and in
                    their narratives more or less fully described one or other of these birds, whose
                    large size and fearless habits render them conspicuous objects.</p>
                <p>As a whole the Hornbills, of which more than 50 species have been described, form
                    a very natural and in some respects an isolated group, placed by Professor
                    Huxley among his <hi rend="italic">Goccygornorphoe.</hi> It has been suggested
                    that they have some affinity with the Hoopoes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ujrupidoe),</hi> but even if that view be good the affinity cannot be very
                    near. Their supposed alliance to the Toucans <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Rhamphastidoe)</hi> rests only on the apparent similarity presented by the
                    enormous beak, and is contradicted by important structural characters. In many
                    of their habits, so far as these are known, all Hornbills seem to be much alike,
                    and though the modification in the form of the beak, and the presence or absence
                    of the extraordinary excrescence,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    them, the possession of prominent eyelashes (not a common feature in Birds)
                    produces a uniformity of expression which makes it impossible to mistake any
                    member of the family. Hornbills are social birds, keeping in companies, not to
                    say flocks, and living chiefly on fruits and seeds; but the bigger species also
                    capture and devour a large number of snakes, while the smaller are great
                    destroyers of insects. The older writers say that they eat carrion, but further
                    evidence to that effect is required before the statement can be believed. Almost
                    every morsel of food that is picked up is tossed into the air, and then caught
                    in the bill before it is swallowed. They breed in holes of trees, laying large
                    white eggs, and when the hen begins to sit the cock plasters up the entrance
                    with mud or clay, leaving only a small window through which she receives the
                    food he brings her during O o o he? incarceration.</p>

                    plump and soft, and with a semi-transparent skin, so that it looked more like a

                    the Malay Archipelago, has been connected by Mr Bartlett <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1869, p. 142) with a peculiarity as remarkable,
                    which he was the first to notice. This is the fact that Hornbills at intervals
                    of time, whether periodical or irregular is not yet known, cast the epithelial
                    layer of their gizzard, that layer being formed by a secretion derived from the
                    glands of the proventriculus or some other upper part of the alimentary canal.
                    The epithelium is ejected in the form of a sack or bag, the mouth of which is
                    closely folded, and is filled with the fruit that the bird has been eating. The
                    announcement of a circumstance so extraordinary naturally caused some hesitation
                    in its acceptance, but the essential truth of Mr Bartlett’s observations has
                    been abundantly confirmed by Professor Flower <hi rend="italic">(tom. cit.,</hi>
                    p. 150), and especially by Dr Murie <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> 1874, p.
                    420), and what seems now to be most wanted is to know whether these castings are
                    really intended to form the hen bird’s food during her confinement. <hi
