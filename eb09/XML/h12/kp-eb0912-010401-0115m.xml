                    tenderly brought up by the third wife, together with her own large family. In
                    his ninth year, Hölty, till then a beautiful and lively child, was smitten with
                    smallpox, and was for some time nearly blind. On his recovery, his features and
                    disposition were altered, and he was through life plain, silent, and awkward.
                    From an early age he was an inveterate lover of solitude and books. He was
                    taught at home by his father, besides the ordinary school branches, Latin,
                    French, and Hebrew, and at the age of sixteen was sent to the public school of
                    Celle. On leaving Celle three years later, he went as a theological student to
                    Göttingen, where, however, he devoted his leisure hours to the study of the
                    English and Italian poets, and began his own literary career. The appearance of
                    some of his verses in a Göttingen weekly paper, especially those on the death of
                    Münchhausen, brought his name before the public, and he was shortly afterwards
                    admitted as a member of the “German Society.” He now made the acquaintance of
                    Bürger, Miller, Voss, Boie, the brothers Stolberg, and other poets, in
                    conjunction with whom he formed in 1772 the famous poetical brotherhood known as
                    the “Hainbund.” The next two years were spent by Hölty in this brilliant and
                    enthusiastic company; and, with the assistance of a scholarship and a post in
                    the philological seminary in Göttingen, he succeeded in making a scanty
                    livelihood by teaching English and Greek and by making translations. In 1774,
                    having abandoned the intention of entering the church, he accompanied his friend
                    Miller to Leipsic, where he remained for a year in the hopes of obtaining a
                    private tutorship. The penniless young poet had for some time been silently
                    attached to a lady, who about this time married some more eligible suitor. His
                    health now began to cause him anxiety, and symptoms of consumption, inherited
                    from his mother, made their appearance. His prospects were further altered by
                    the death of his father in 1775; and Hölty found himself not only thrown
                    entirely on his own resources, but obliged in some measure to assist his family.
                    Towards the end of 1775 he settled in Hanover, to be near his physician
                    Zimmermann and his friend Boie, and there he died in his twenty-eighth year,
                    September 1, 1776. Hölty was a writer of ballads, idylls, elegies, and odes. His
                    conceptions, if not lofty, are always graceful, his style finished, his language
                    and rhythm faultless. He was from the first one of the shining lights of the
                    “Hainbund,” and during his short career became one of the most popular of German
                    lyric poets. Many of his songs have become folk-songs, and his ballads have been
                    ranked with those of Bürger.</p>
                <p>Hölty was engaged when he died in collecting and revising his poems for the
                    press; and after his death his friends Boie and Voss undertook the charge of
                    their publication. In 1782, however, an incorrect edition of his works appeared
                    edited by Geissler, which contained many poems not by Holty. The correct edition
                    was first published by Voss and Stolberg in 1783, and again, revised, in 1804.
