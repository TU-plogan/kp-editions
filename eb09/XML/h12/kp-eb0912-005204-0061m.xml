                    Of his family little is known; according to J. J. Rousseau, his father was a
                    rich parvenu, who brought his son at an early age to Paris, where the latter
                    spent most of his life. Much of Holbach’s fame is due to his intimate connexion
                    with the brilliant coterie of bold thinkers and polished wits whose creed, the
                    new philosophy, is concentrated in the famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie.</hi> Possessed of easy means and being of hospitable disposition,
                    he kept open house for such men as Helvetius, D’Alembert, Diderot, Condillac,
                    Turgot, Buffon, Grimm, Hume, Garrick, Wilkes, Sterne, and for a time Rousseau,
                    who, while enjoying the intellectual pleasure of their host’s conversation, were
                    not insensible to the material charms of his excellent cuisine and costly
                    wines.</p>

                <p>Although an atheist, or at least a materialist of the most material school,
                    Holbach seems to have been endowed with a more than average share of virtue,
                    and, whether by his courtesy, gentleness, or benevolence, inspired a warm
                    affection in all he met. Even bis failings, of which his simple credulity was
                    perhaps the most prominent, were amiable. He was one of the best informed men of
                    his day, and his excellent memory placed at his immediate disposal all the
                    learning he had amassed. He visited England on one occasion, but the solemn
                    stiffness of the British, even while amusing themselves, and the peculiar
                    relatione of society, disgusted as much as they surprised him. For the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> Holbach compiled and translated a large number
                    of articles on chemistry and mineralogy, chiefly from German sources. He
                    attracted more attention, however, in the department of philosophy. In 1767 <hi
                    rend="italic">Christianisme</hi><hi rend="italic">Devoile</hi> appeared, in
                    which he attacked Christianity and religion as the source of all human evils.
                    Regarding religion as a blind superstitious bondage, maintained on men’s minds
                    bj <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> the self-interest of the priests, he tried to
                    prove it not only unnecessary but absolutely prejudicial to human morality. This
                    was followed up in 1770 by a still more open attack in his most famous book, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Système de la Nature,</hi> in which it is probable he was
                    assisted by Diderot. Denying the existence of a deity, and refusing to admit as
                    evidence all <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> arguments, Holbach saw in the
                    universe nothing save matter in spontaneous movement. What men call their souls
                    become extinct when the body dies. Happiness is the end of mankind. “It would be
                    useless and almost unjust to insist upon a man’s being virtuous if he cannot be
                    so without being unhappy. So long as vice renders him happy, he should love
                    vice.” Not less direct and trenchant are his attacks on political government,
                    which, interpreted by the light of after events, sound like the first distant
                    mutterings of the tempest that shortly after his death broke over the capital of
                    France. The <hi rend="italic">Système</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Nature</hi>
                    struck horror into the minds of even the most “enlightened” of the Parisian
                    philosophers. Charmed by the novelty of their own opinions, and dazzled by the
                    glittering wit and argument with which they had supported them, they had never
                    realized into what extremities they had hurried till this lurid torch revealed
                    the hideous abyss from which they were so little removed. Voltaire hastily
                    seized his pen to refute the philosophy of the <hi rend="italic">Système,</hi>
                    in the article “Dieu” in his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Philosophique,</hi>
                    while Frederick the Great also drew up an answer to it. Though vigorous in
                    thought and in some passages clear and eloquent, the style of the book is
                    diffuse and declamatory, and asserts rather than proves its statements. Its
                    principles are summed up in a more popular form in <hi rend="italic">Bon</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sens,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou Idées naturelles opposées aux idées
                    surnaturelles,</hi> published at Amsterdam in 1772. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Système</hi><hi rend="italic">Social</hi> (1773), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Politique</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturelle</hi> (1773-74), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morale</hi><hi rend="italic">Universelle</hi> (1776), Holbach
                    attempts to rear a system of morality in place of the one he had so fiercely
                    attacked, but these later writings had not a tithe of the popularity and
                    influence of his earlier and more pernicious work. He published his books either
                    anonymously or under a borrowed name, and was forced to have them printed out of
                    France. He died in 1789. On the death of his first wife he obtained a papal
                    dispensation to marry her sister, who survived him till 1814.</p>
