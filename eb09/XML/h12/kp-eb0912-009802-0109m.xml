                    October 1788. He could claim relationship to three persons who have attained
                    eminence in careers entirely different both from one another and from his own:
                    his maternal grandmother was the sister of Josiah Wedgwood, whose grandson was
                    Charles Darwin; and his paternal aunt was the mother of Mrs Gaskell. After
                    spending some years at a private school at Knutsford, he was sent to a school at
                    Newcastle-on-Tyne, whence after four years he was transferred to Dr Estlin’s
                    school near Bristol. There he at once took the position of head boy, in
                    succession to John Cam Hobhouse, afterwards Lord Broughton, an honour which
                    required to be maintained by physical prowess. On leaving <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0110-0099"/> school he became articled clerk to a mercantile
                    firm in Liverpool, but, as the privilege was reserved to him of passing two
                    sessions at Glasgow university, he at the close of his second session sought
                    relief from his articles, and in 1806 began the study of medicine in the
                    university of Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1811. After several years spent
                    in foreign travel, he began practice in 1816 as a physician in London,—according
                    to his own statement, “with a fair augury of success speedily and completely
                    fulfilled.” This “success,” he adds, “was materially aided by visits for four
                    successive years to Spa, at the close of that which is called the London
                    season.” It must also, however, be in a great degree attributed to his happy
                    temperament and his gifts as a conversationalist—qualities the influence of
                    which, in the majority of cases belonging to his class of practice, is often of
                    more importance than direct medical treatment. In 1816 he was elected a fellow
                    of the Royal Society, and in 1828 a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.
                    He became physician in ordinary to Prince Albert in 1840, and was appointed in
                    1852 physician in ordinary to the Queen. In April 1853 he was created a baronet.
                    He was also a D.C.L. of Oxford and a member of the principal learned societies
                    of Europe. He was twice married, his second wife being a daughter of Sydney
                    Smith, a lady of considerable literary talent, who published a biography of her
                    father. Sir Henry Holland at an early period of his practice resolved to devote
                    to his professional duties no more of his time than was necessary to secure an
                    income of £5000 a-year, and also to spend two months of every year solely in
                    foreign travel. By the former resolution he secured leisure for a wide
                    acquaintance with general literature, and for a more than superficial
                    cultivation of several branches of science; and the latter enabled him, besides
                    visiting, “and most of them repeatedly, every country of Europe,” to make
                    extensive tours in the other three continents, journeying often to places little
                    frequented by European travellers. As, moreover, he procured an introduction to
                    nearly all the eminent personages in his line of travel, and knew many of them
                    in his capacity of physician, his acquaintance with “men and cities” was of a
                    species without a parallel. The <hi rend="italic">London Medical Record,</hi> in
                    noticing his death, which took place on his eighty-fifth birthday, October 27,
                    1873, remarked that it “had occurred under circumstances highly characteristic
                    of his remarkable career.” On his return from a journey in Russia he was
                    present, on Friday, October 24th, at the trial of Marshal Bazaine in Paris,
                    dining with some of the judges in the evening. He reached London on the
                    Saturday, took ill the following day, and died quietly on the Monday
                    afternoon.</p>
