                <p><label type="entry">HYACINTH</label>, also called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jacinth,</hi> one of the most popular of garden flowers, “supreme amongst the
                    flowers of spring.” It is no new favourite, having been in cultivation prior to
                    1597, at which date Gerard records the existence of six varieties, which are not
                    indicated as particularly fare or novel. Rea in 1676 mentions several single and
                    double varieties as being then in English gardens, and Justice in 1754 describes
                    upwards of fifty single-flowered varieties, and nearly one hundred
                    double-fiowered ones, as a selection of the best from the catalogues of two then
                    celebrated Dutch growers. One of the Dutch sorts, called La Reine de Femmes, a
                    single white, is said to have produced from thirty-four to thirty-eight flowers
                    in a spike, and on its first appearance to have sold for 50 guilders a bulb;
                    while one called Overwinnaar or Conqueror, a double blue, sold at first for 100
                    guilders, Gloria Mundi for 500 guilders, and Koning Saloman for 600 guilders.
                    Several sorts are at that date mentioned as blooming well in water-glasses.
                    Justice relates that he himself raised several very valuable double-flowered
                    kinds from seeds, which many of the sorts he describes are noted for producing
                    freely.</p>
                <p>The original of the cultivated hyacinth, <hi rend="italic">Hyacinthus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">orientalis,</hi> is by comparison an insignificant plant, bearing
                    on a spike only a few small narrow-lobed washy blue flowers. So great has been
                    the improvement effected by the florists, and chiefly by the Dutch, that the
                    modern hyacinth would scarcely be recognized as the descendant of the type above
                    referred to, the spikes being long and dense, composed of a large number of
                    flowers; the spikes produced by strong bulbs not unfrequently measure 6 or 7
                    inches in length and from 7 to 9 inches in circumference, with the flowers
                    closely set on from bottom to top. Of late <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n435/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0435-0420"/> years much improvement has been effected in the
                    size of the individual flowers and the breadth of their recurving lobes, as well
                    as in securing increased brilliancy and depth of colour.</p>
                <p>The peculiarities of the soil and climate of Holland are so very favourable to
                    their production that Dutch florists have made a specialty of the growth of
                    those and other bulbous-rooted flowers. An area of 125 acres is devoted to the
                    growth of hyacinths in the vicinity of Haarlem, and is estimated to bring in a
                    revenue of nearly £30,000. Some notion of the vast number imported into England
                    annually may be formed from the fact that, for the supply of flowering plants to
                    Covent Garden, one market grower alone produces from 60,000 to 70,000 in pots
                    under glass, their blooming period being accelerated by artificial heat, and
                    extending from Christmas onwards until they bloom naturally in the open
                    ground.</p>
                <p>In the spring flower garden few plants make a more effective display than the
                    hyacinth. Dotted in clumps in the flower borders, and arranged in masses of
                    well-contrasted colours in beds in the flower garden, there are no flowers which
                    impart during their season—March and April—a gayer tone to the parterre. The
                    bulbs are rarely grown a second time, either for indoor or outdoor culture,
                    though with care they might be utilized for the latter purpose; and hence the
                    enormous numbers which are procured each recurring year from Holland.</p>
                <p>The first hyacinths were single-flowered, but towards'the close of the 17th
                    century double-flowered ones began to appear, and till a recent period these
                    bulbs were the most esteemed. At the present time, however, the single -
                    flowered sorts are in the ascendant, as they produce more regular and
                    symmetrical spikes of blossom, the flowers being closely set and more or less
                    horizontal in direction, while most of the double sorts have the bells distant
                    and dependent, so that the spike is loose and by comparison ineffective. For pot
                    culture, and for growth in water-glasses especially, the single-flowered sorts
                    are greatly to be preferred. Few if any of the original kinds are now in
                    cultivation, a succession of new and improved varieties having been raised, the
                    demand for which is regulated in some respects by fashion. At the present day
                    our nurserymen offer in their annual catalogues of select sorts between two and
                    three hundred distinct varieties.</p>
                <p>The earliest of all the hyacinths, and one which is very valuable for forcing
                    into flower in winter, is called the white Roman hyacinth. It is small-flowered,
                    but very sweet, and, if potted in September or October, as soon as the bulbs can
                    be procured after importation, may easily be had in blossom by Christmas, when
                    white flowers are so much sought after. Of course this is done with the aid of a
                    forcing-house, but a very high temperature is not required. The best soil for
                    pot hyacinths is made up of two parts turfy loam, one part decayed leaf-mould,
                    and one part well-decomposed cow dung, with sand enough to make it porous, and
                    with sufficient drainage.</p>
                <p>The name of hyacinth is applied to several other plants having bulbous roots. The
                    Cape hyacinth is <hi rend="italic">Scilla</hi><hi rend="italic">corymbosa;</hi>
                    the grape hyacinth, <hi rend="italic">Muscari</hi><hi rend="italic"
