                    quartz or silica which is always present in predominating proportion, some kinds
                    consisting of almost pure quartz, while in others the siliceous element is very
                    intimately mixed with aluminous or calcareous matter, forming a uniform compact
                    stone, the extremely fine siliceous particles of which impart a remarkably keen
                    edge to the instruments for the sharpening of which they are applied. Hones are
                    used either dry, with water, or with oil, and generally the object to be
                    sharpened is drawn with hand pressure backward and forward over the surface of
                    the hone; but sometimes the stone is moved over the cutting edge. The coarsest
                    type of stone which can be included among hones is the bat or scythe stone, a
                    porous fine-grained sandstone used for sharpening scythes and cutters of mowing
                    machines, and for other like purposes. Next come the ragstones, which consist of
                    quartzose micaschist, and give a finer edge than any sandstone. Under the head
                    of oilstones or hones proper the most famous and best-known qualities are the
                    German razor hone, the Turkey oilstone, and the Arkansas stone. The German razor
                    hone, used, as its name implies, chiefly for razors, is obtained from the slate
                    mountains near Ratisbon, where it forms a yellow vein of from 1 to 18 inches in
                    the blue slate. It is sawn into thin slabs, and these are cemented to slabs of
                    slate which serve as a support. Turkey oilstone is a close-grained bluish stone
                    containing from 70 to 75 per cent, of silica in a state of very fine division,
                    intimately blended with about 20 to 25 per cent, of calcite. It is obtained only
                    in small pieces, frequently flawed and not tough, so that the slabs must have a
                    backing of slate or wood. It is one of the most valuable of all whetstones,
                    abrading the hardest steel, and possessing sufficient compactness to resist the
                    pressure required for sharpening gravers. The stone comes from the interior of
                    Asia Minor, whence it is carried to Smyrna. Of Arkansas stones there are two
                    varieties both found in the same district, Garland county, Arkansas, United
                    States. The finer kind, known as Arkansas hone, is obtained in small pieces at
                    the hot springs, and the second quality, distinguished as Washita stone, comes
                    from Washita or Ouachita river. The hones yield on analysis 98 per cent, of
                    silica, with small proportions of alumina, potash, and soda, and mere traces of
                    iron, lime, magnesia, and hydrofluoric acid. They are white in colour, extremely
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0146-0135"/> hard and keen in grit, and not easily worn down
                    or broken. Geologically the materials belong to the millstone grit series, and
                    are supposed to be metamorphosed sandstone resulting from the permeation through
                    the mass of heated alkaline siliceous waters. The finer kind is employed for
                    fine cutting instruments, and also for polishing steel pivots of watch-wheels
                    and similar minute work, the second and coarser quality being used for common
                    tools. Both varieties are largely exported from the United States to all
                    quarters in the form of blocks, slips, pencils, rods, and wheels. During the
                    Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the comparative value of hones per lb was thus
                    quoted— Arkansas $1'50, Washita '35, Turkey 1Ό0. Among hones of less importance
                    in general use may be noted Charnley Forest stone, a good substitute for Turkey
                    oilstone; Water of Ayr stone, Scotch stone, or snake stone, used for tools and
                    for polishing marble and copperplates; Idwal or Welsh oiLuone, used for small
                    articles; and cutlers’ greenstone from Snowdon, very hard and close in texture,
                    used for giving the last edge to lancets.</p>
