                    Tippoo, became the most formidable Asiatic rival the English have ever had in
                    India, was the great grandson of a fakir or wandering ascetic of Islam, who had
                    found his way from the Punjab to Kulburga in the south, and the second son of
                    the Arab wife of a naik or chief constable at Budikote, near Colar, in Mysore,
                    and was born about the beginning of the 18th century. The elder brother who,
                    like himself, was early turned out into the world to seek his own fortune,
                    became a naik, and ultimately rose to command a brigade in the Mysore army,
                    while Hyder, who never learned to read or write, passed the first forty-seven
                    years of his life aimlessly in sport and sensuality, sometimes, however, acting
                    as the agent of his brother, and meanwhile acquiring a useful familiarity with
                    the tactics of the French when at the height of their reputation under Dupleix.
                    He is said to have induced his brother to employ a Parsee to purchase artillery
                    and small arms from the Bombay Government, and to enrol some thirty sailors of
                    different European nations as gunners, and is thus credited with having been
                    “the first Indian who formed a corps of sepoys armed with firelocks and
                    bayonets, and who had a train of artillery served by Europeans.” At the siege of
                    Deonhully (1749) Hyder’s services attracted the attention of Nunjeraj, the
                    minister of the maharajah of Mysore, and he at once received an independent
                    command; within the next twelve years his energy and ability had made him
                    completely master of minister and maharajah alike, and in everything but in name
                    he was ruler of the kingdom. In 1763 the conquest of Canara gave him possession
                    of the treasures of Bednore, which he resolved to make the most splendid capital
                    in India, under his own name, thenceforth changed from Hyder Naik into Hyder Ali
                    Khan Bahadoor; and in 1765 he retrieved previous defeat at the hands of the
                    Marhattas by the destruction of the Nairs or military caste of the Malabar
                    coast, and the conquest of Calicut. Hyder Ali now began to occupy the serious
                    attention of the Madras Government, which in 1766 entered into an agreement with
                    the nizam to hold the district known as the Northern Circars from him, and to
                    furnish him with troops to be used against the common foe. But hardly had this
                    alliance been formed when a new and secret arrangement was come to between the
                    two Indian powers, the result of which was that Colonel Smith’s small force was
                    met with a united army of 80,000 men and 100 guns. British dash and sepoy
                    fidelity, however, prevailed, first in the battle of Changama (September 3,
                    1767), and again still more remarkably in that of Trinomalee, which lasted two
                    days; and the nizam’s own capital of Hyderabad was threatened by Colonel Peach’s
                    expedition sent from Bengal. On the loss of his recently made fleet and forts on
                    the western coast, Hyder Ali now began to make overtures for peace; on the
                    rejection of these, bringing all his resources and strategy into play, he forced
                    Colonel Smith to raise the siege of Bangalore, and brought his army within five
                    miles of Madras. The result was the treaty of April 1769, providing for the
                    mutual restitution of all conquests, and for mutual aid and alliance in
                    defensive war; it was followed by a commercial treaty in 1770 with the
                    authorities of Bombay. Under these arrangements Hyder Ali, when defeated by the
                    Marhattas in 1772, claimed English assistance, but in vain; this breach of faith
                    s'.ung him to fury, and thenceforward he and his son did not cease to thirst for
                    vengeance. His time came when in 1778 the English, on the declaration of war,
                    resolved to drive the French out of India. The capture of Mahe on the coast of
                    Malabar in 1779, followed by the annexation of lands belonging to a dependant of
                    his own, gave him the needed pretext. Again master of all that the Marhattas had
                    taken from him, and with empire extended to the Kistna, he now summoned the
                    French to his assistance, and, descending through the Changama pass amid burning
                    villages, reached Conjeveram, only forty-five miles from Madras, unopposed. Not
                    till the smoke was seen from St Thomas’s Mount, where Sir Hector Munro commanded
                    some 5200 troops, was any movement made; then, however, the British general
                    sought to effect a junction with a smaller body under Colonel Baillie recalled
                    from Guntoor. The incapacity of these officers, notwithstanding the splendid
                    courage of their men, resulted in the total loss of Baillie’s force of 2800
                    (September 10, 1780). Hastings, again appealed to, sent from Bengal Sir Eyre
                    Coote, who, though repulsed at Chillumbrum, defeated Hyder thrice <pb break="no"

                    Wandewash, and Vellore was provisioned. On the arrival of Lord Macartney as
                    governor of Madras, the English fleet captured Negapatam, took Trincomalee from
                    the Dutch, and forced Hyder Ali to confess that he could never ruin a power
                    which had such command of the sea. He was directing his attention to the west
                    coast, where he sought the assistance of the French fleet, when his death took
                    place suddenly at Chittore in December 1782.</p>
