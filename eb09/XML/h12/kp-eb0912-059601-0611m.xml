                    she became a distinguished lecturer on philosophy in her native town, and
                    ultimately became the recognized head of the Neo-Platonic school there (c. 400).
                    The fascination of her great eloquence (she is said on more than one occasion to
                    have proved an effective advocate in the courts of law), and the charm of a rare
                    modesty and beauty, combined with her remarkable intellectual gifts to attract
                    to her class-room a large number of disciples, over some of whom her influence
                    was very great. Among these was Synesius, who afterwards (c. 410) became bishop
                    of Ptolemais, several of whose letters addressed to her (<hi rend="italic"
                    >τy</hi><hi rend="italic">φιλοσοφώ),</hi> full of chivalrous admiration and
                    reverence, are still extant <hi rend="italic">(Epp.</hi> 10, 15, 16, 33, 80,
                    124, 153). In the conflicts between the various elements of Alexandrian society
                    which took place shortly after the accession of Cyril to the patriarchate in
                    412, she became closely identified as counsellor and friend with the prefect
                    Orestes, and in the same degree made herself an object of fear and hatred to the
                    Nitrian monks and the fanatical Christian mob, by whom she was ultimately
                    murdered under circumstances of revolting barbarity (Lent, 415). Socrates has
                    related how she was torn from her chariot, dragged to the Caesareum (then a
                    Christian church), stripped naked, cut to pieces with oyster shells <hi
                    rend="italic">(άστράκονζ</hi> αveιλov), and finally burnt piecemeal. Most
                    prominent among the actual perpetrators of the crime was one Γeter, a reader;
                    but there seems little reason to doubt Γheodoret ’ s assertion of Cyril’s real
                    complicity.</p>
                <p>Hypatia, according to Suidas, was the author of com mentaries on the
                    mathematician Diophantus and on the <hi rend="italic">Conics</hi> of Apollonius
                    of Perga, and also of an astronomical canon. None of these works have come down
                    to our time; but their titles, combined with expressions in the letters of
                    Synesius, who consulted her about the construction of an astrolabe, would seem
                    to indicate that she devoted herself specially to astronomy and mechanics. Of
                    her philosophical opinions nothing is known, except that they shared the general
                    eclectic features of the Alexandrian NeoPlatonism. A Latin letter to Cyril on
                    behalf of Nestorius, which has sometimes been attributed to her, is undoubtedly
                    spurious. It can be read in Baluze. The story of Hypatia appears in a
                    considerably disguised yet still recognizable form in the legend of St Catherine
                    as recorded in the Roman <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> (Nov. 25), and still
                    more fully in the <hi rend="italic">Martyrologies</hi> (see Jameson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacred and Legendary Art,</hi> p. 467 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqqf</hi></p>
                <p>The chief source for the little we know about Hypatia is the account given by
                    Socrates (2Γ. <hi rend="italic">E.,</hi> vii. 15). The article in Suidas, which
                    Gibbon has characterized as “curious and original,” must be received with some
                    caution. It is on his authority that the somewhat doubtful statement is made
                    that she was the wife of Isidoras the philosopher. She is the subject of an
                    epigram by Palladas in the <hi rend="italic">Anthology</hi> (ix. 400; ed.
                    Jacobs). See Menage, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Mul. Phil.,</hi> p. 52; Fabricius,
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibl. Gr.,</hi> ix. 187 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi>;
                    Wernsdorf, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>; and the exhaustive monograph of

                    every way accomplished lady, who was torn to pieces by the clergy of Alexandria

                    but undeservedly styled Saint Cyril,</hi> was published in London in 1720. The
                    history of Hypatia has also been made the basis of an attractive historical
                    romance by Charles Kingsley (1853).</p>
