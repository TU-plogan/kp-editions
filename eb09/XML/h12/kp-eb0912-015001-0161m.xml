                <p><label type="entry">HOOKER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label> (1814-1879),
                    American general, was born in Old Hadley, Massachusetts, November 13, 1814. He
                    was educated at the Military Academy at West Point, 1833-37, and immediately
                    commissioned second lieutenant in the 1st Artillery. In the war with Mexico
                    (1846-48) he served as aide-de-camp and assistant adjutant-general, and was
                    breveted captain, major, and lieutenant-colonel, and commissioned captain, for
                    meritorious services in the engagements at Monterey, National Bridge,
                    andChapultepec. He was transferred with his regiment to California in 1849. In
                    1853 he resigned his commission and bought a large farm near Sonoma, which he
                    managed successfully till 1858, when he was made superintendent of military
                    roads in Oregon. Upon the opening of hostilities in the civil war of 1861-65, he
                    sacrificed his fine estate and offered bis sword to the Federal Government. He
                    was commissioned brigadier-general of volunteers, May 17, 1861, and
                    major-general May 5, 1862. At Williamsburg, May 5th, he attacked a strong
                    Confederate position, and for nine hours maintained the fight, inflicting and
                    sustaining heavy loss, and winning the title of “Fighting Joe.” Tie was engaged
                    at Fair Oaks, June 1st, and at Malvern Hill, July 1st, and did signal service at
                    Charles City Cross Roads, June 29th, when his division aided in holding a vital
                    position on the flank of the Union Army, in its noted “change of base.” In the
                    campaign of Northern Virginia, under General Pope, August 27 to September 1,
                    1862, he led his division in the actions at Bristoe Station, Manassas, and
                    Chantilly. In the Maryland campaign, September 6-17 (under General M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Clellan), he commanded the first corps, and gallantly
                    carried the north pass of South Mount, opening the way for the advance of the
                    army. He opened the battle of Antietam on the 14th, and on the following morning
                    was pitted against “Stonewall” Jackson, at the noted “cornfield,” where he used
                    his artillery with terrible effect, but received a painful wound, and was borne
                    from the field. He was commissioned brigadier-general in the United States army
                    September 20, 1862, and in the disastrous battle of Fredericksburg, under
                    Burnside, he commanded the centre grand division (3d and 5th corps). He
                    commanded the army of the Potomac January 26th to June 28th, 1863, and, having
                    by a fine strategic movement thrown his army across a turbulent stream in face
                    of the foe, fought a severe battle at Chancellorsville, where he was seriously
                    injured; and, his army being thrown into an unfavourable position by the
                    unexpected giving way of his right wing, he decided to retire. He was relieved
                    at his own request, on the 28th of June, with the thanks of Congress “for skill,
                    energy, and endurance” in the beginning of the Gettysburg campaign. He commanded
                    the 20th corps (11th and 12th corps consolidated) in the Atlanta campaign,
                    winning special distinction in the night battle of Wauhatchie, and at Lookout
                    Mountain, “the battle above the clouds.” For a hundred days, and until the
                    capture of Atlanta, the noise of battle scarcely ceased, his corps doing signal
                    service at Mill Creek, Resaca, New Hope Church, Pine Mount, Peach Tree Creek,
                    and the siege of Atlanta. He was commissioned brevet-major-general in the United
                    States army, March 13, 1865, and retired from active service at his own request,
                    October 15, 1868. The last years of his life were passed in the neighbourhood of
                    New York. He died at Garden City, Long Island, October 31, 1879.</p>
