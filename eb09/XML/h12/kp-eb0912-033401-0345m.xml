                <p><label type="entry">HUELVA</label>, one of the eight provinces into which
                    Andalucia has since 1833 been divided, is bounded on the N. by Badajoz, on the
                    E. by Seville, on the S. and S.W. by the Atlantic, and on the W. by Portugal,
                    and has an area of 4122 square miles. With the exception of its south-east
                    angle, where the province merges into the flat waste lands known as Las Marismas
                    of the Guadalquivir, Huelva presents throughout its entire extent an agreeably
                    varied surface, being traversed in a south-westerly direction by the western
                    spurs of the Sierra Morena. The principal streams are the Odiel and the Tinto,
                    which both fall into the Atlantic by navigable rias or estuaries; the Malagon,
                    the Chanza, the Murtiga, which belong to the Guadiana system, and the Huelva,
                    belonging to that of the Guadalquivir, also take their rise in this province.
                    Iron pyrites and manganese occur in the Sierra in considerable quantities; among
                    many important mines, which are at present inactive, may be mentioned Lagunazo,
                    Carpio, Lapilla, San Miguel, Mυnterubio, Sotiel, Coronada, San Telmo, Cueva de
                    la Mora, and Toya. Those of Rio Tinto, situated to the north-east of Valverde
                    del Camino, and near the source of the river Tinto, are ascertained to have been
                    known to the Phoenicians and Romans. They are at present wrought by an
                    Anglo-German company; in 1876 the output amounted to 329,305 tons; the number of
                    men employed approached 5000. The mines of Tharsis and Calanas, and of Buitron
                    and Poderosa, are of corresponding importance. Saline and other mineral springs
                    are also of frequent occurrence in the province. The soil possesses great
                    fertility, and produces excellent pasturage; among the exports are included,
                    besides corkwood and esparto, oranges, grapes, figs, oil, and wine. The only
                    railways at present in the province are those constructed for mineral traffic
                    between Rio Tinto mines and Huelva (52 miles), between Tharsis and Huelva (30
                    miles), and between Buitron and Poderosa and San Juan del Puerto at the head of
                    the Tinto estuary (44 miles); but a line from Huelva to Seville is at present in
                    course of construction. The towns of chief interest and importance in the
                    province are, besides Huelva the capital, Ayamonte, Aracena, Valverde, La Palma,
                    Niebla, and Moguer, with Palos its harbour. The population in 1877 was
                    210,641.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Huelva,</hi> the capital of the above province, is situated
                    on the western shore of the triangular peninsula formed by the estuaries of the
                    Odiel and Tinto, 53 miles west by south of Seville. Its streets are wide and
                    well built, and among the public edifices may be mentioned two parish churches,
                    an Academia Onubense, two hospitals, and a theatre. The town has a considerable
                    coasting trade in the produce of the province, and there is a limited
                    manufacture of esparto floor mattings; others of the inhabitants find employment
                    in the sardine, tunny, and bonito fisheries of the neighbourhood. The chief
                    source of the growing prosperity of Huelva, however, is in connexion with the
                    extensive exportation of ore from the Tharsis and Rio Tinto mines. The total
                    quantity of pyrites shipped amounted in 1872 to 261,373 tons, and in 1876 had
                    risen to 442,201 tons (value £552,506). The exportation of manganese, however,
                    which in 1868 amounted to 41,000 tons, did not in 1876 exceed 6972 tons (value
                    £41,813); 7178 tons of precipitate of copper were valued at £279,956. For the
                    accommodation of the Rio Tinto mineral traffic there is a fine pier 2682 feet
                    long, 65∣ feet wide, and 43∣ feet above the level of the river at high-water, at
                    which vessels of 2000 tons can be moored and loaded with ease. In 1876 the total
                    number of vessels entering the port was 1409, with a tonnage of 278,594; of
                    these 512 were British, with a tonnage of 237,610. The total imports amounted to
                    £315,856; from Great Britain, £149,939. Total exports £918,506; to Great
                    Britain, £833.968. Population 13,174 (1877).</p>
                <p>Huelva is usually identified with the Onuba Aestuaria of Ptolemy, the Önoba or
                    Onuba of Strabo, Mela, and the numismatists, described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antonine Itinerary</hi> as situated on the estuary of the river Luxia, on the
                    road from the mouth of the Anas to Augusta Emerita. There still exist vestiges
                    of a Roman aqueduct, which, however, are fast disappearing. The town is alleged
                    to have been founded by the Phoenicians; the name Welba or Wuelba is due to the
                    Moors.</p>
