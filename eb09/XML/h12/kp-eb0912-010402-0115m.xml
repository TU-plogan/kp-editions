                    connected with the mainland by an embankment three quarters of a mile long, over
                    which pass both the railway and the coach road. Underneath the bridge in the
                    centre the tide rushes with great velocity. The town, formerly a small fishing
                    village, has since the reign of William III. acquired importance as the station
                    of the mail packets for Dublin, and it now possesses a magnificent harbour of
                    refuge begun in 1847, and formally opened in September 1873. The original plan
                    included the erection of a north breakwater 5360 feet in length from the
                    coast-line, and also of an east breakwater 2000 feet in length, but the scheme
                    of the east breakwater, of which the chief object was to cover the Platter’s and
                    Skinner’s Rocks, was subsequently abandoned, and their positions were marked
                    instead by buoys. On account of the number of vessels which began to take
                    advantage of the shelter that was being provided for them it was also resolved
                    to lengthen the northern breakwater in a north-easterly direction by 2000 feet,
                    and subsequently by 500 feet more, making its total length 7860 feet. By these
                    additions a sheltered roadstead of 400 acres in extent was obtained, besides the
                    enclosed area of 267 acres. The breakwater consists of a rubble mound, upon
                    which is erected <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0116-0105"/> a solid central wall of massive masonry rising to
                    a height of 38 feet 9 inches above low water. On the wall there is a promenade
                    sheltered on the sea side by a parapet. The breakwater is terminated by a head
                    150 feet long and 50 feet wide, on which is erected a lighthouse, The whole cost
                    of the works was £1,479,538. In 1873 works were commenced by the railway company
                    for extending the old harbour and increasing the length of the quay to 4000
                    feet. They were opened by the prince of Wales in June 1880. The cost has been
                    nearly half a million sterling. Upon the pier of the old harbour there is an
                    arch of Mona marble, commemorative of the visit of George IV. in 1821 on his way
                    to Ireland. The church, an old embattled building, is said to occupy the site of
                    an ancient monastery founded by St Gybi about 610; and in the south porch there
                    is a rude figure of the patron saint under a canopy. The churchyard is
                    surrounded by a wall 6 feet thick, supposed by some to be of Roman
                    construction.</p>
                <p>The town possesses assembly-rooms and baths. On the rock south of the harbour is
                    an obelisk erected in memory of Captain Skinner, commander of the steam packet,
                    who in 1833 lost his life by being washed overboard. About 2 miles from the
                    town, Pen-Caer-Gybi, or the hill of Holyhead, rises perpendicularly from the sea
                    to the height of 700 feet, affording a fine view of the town and harbour, and
                    the irregularities of the rock-bound coast. On the sides of the hill there are
                    traces of an extensive British fortification, and on the summit are remains of a
                    circular building, which in all probability was a Roman watch-tower. The
                    inhabitants are chiefly engaged in the coasting trade and in shipbuilding.
                    Holyhead unites with Beaumaris in returning a member to parliament. The
                    population of the parliamentary borough in 1871 was 8131.</p>
