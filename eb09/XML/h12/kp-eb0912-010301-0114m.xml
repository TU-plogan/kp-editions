                    1787-1857), the “Blind Traveller,” was born about 1787. He entered the British
                    navy in 1798 as first-class volunteer, and was appointed lieutenant in April
                    1807. In 1810 he was invalided by an illness which resulted in the total and
                    hopeless deprivation of sight. In consideration of his helpless circumstances he
                    was in 1812 appointed one of the royal knights of Windsor, but the dulness and
                    seclusion of such a life harmonized so ill with his active habits and his keen
                    interest in the outside world that he requested leave of absence that he might
                    go abroad. This being granted, he in 1819, 1820, and 1821 journeyed through
                    France, Italy, Switzerland, the parts of Germany bordering on the Rhine,
                    Belgium, and the Netherlands. In 1822 he published a narrative of his journey.
                    His enjoyment in his travels was derived from the love of locomotion and the
                    attendant exercise, the varieties of company and of topics of conversation, and
                    the information and descriptions he obtained from eye-witnesses, which
                    constantly supplied him with new materials on which to exercise his imagination.
                    He again set out in 1822 with the design of making the circuit of the world, but
                    after travelling through Russia into Siberia, he was arrested when he had
                    managed to penetrate 1000 miles beyond Smolensk, and after being conducted to
                    the frontiers of Poland, returned home by Austria, Saxony, Prussia, and Hanover.
                    The pretext for arresting him was the suspicion of his being a spy, but the
                    probability is that the authorities wished to prevent him from persevering in
                    what they must have regarded as, to one in his helpless condition, a foolish and
                    hazardous adventure. An account of his journey was published in 1825. Shortly
                    afterwards he again set out to accomplish by a somewhat different method the
                    design which had been frustrated by the Russian authorities; and an account of
                    his remarkable achievement was published in four volumes in 1834-35, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">A Voyage round the World, including Travels in
                    Africa, Asia, Australasia, America, &lt;La, from</hi> 1827 <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> 1832. His last journeys were through Spain, Portugal, Wallachia,
                    Moldavia, Montenegro, Syria, and Turkey; and he was engaged in preparing his
                    journals of this tour for the press when he died at London, 29th July 1857. The
                    works of Holman, besides the interest attaching to them from his incidental
                    references to the peculiarities of his circumstances arising from his physical
                    defect, and to his methods of triumphing over his difficulties, occupy a unique
                    place in literature as products of very extraordinary energy and perseverance,
                    while, on account of the variety of their information and their frequently
                    graphic descriptions, they are of considerable value as books of travel.</p>
