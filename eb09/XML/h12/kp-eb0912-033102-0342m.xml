                    two small streams which rise in the Adirondack mountains in Essex county. About
                    the middle of Warren county the river is joined by another of nearly equal size,
                    the Schroon, which also has its rise in Essex county. After receiving the

                    Mohawk, whose volume of water is greater than its own, and at Kingston the
                    Wallkill, but its other tributaries, though numerous, are unimportant. Its total
                    length is about 300 miles, and the length of its course from Sandy Hill 190
                    miles. At Glen’s Falls, near Sandy Hill, it makes a precipitous descent of 50
                    feet, whence there are various rapids of different velocities until it reaches
                    Troy. It is tidal nearly up to Troy, and the fall from Albany, 6 miles below
                    Troy, to the mouth of the river, a distance of 145 miles, is only 5 feet. By
                    means of a lock and dam it is navigable to Waterford, a short distance above
                    Troy, but large steamers do not proceed further up than Hudson, 29 miles below
                    Albany, and 116 from the mouth of the river. A short distance below Albany the
                    navigation has been obstructed by shifting sands, the point at which the
                    difficulties are most formidable being the “overslaugh” at Castleton, but
                    extensive operations have been for some time carried on in order to effect a
                    permanent remedy for the obstructions. The breadth of the river at Albany is
                    about 300 yards, and thence to Haverstraw, distant 34 miles from New York, it
                    varies from 300 yards to 900 yards. From Haverstraw to Piermont it expands into
                    Tappan Bay, with a length of 12 miles and a breadth of from 4 to 5, after which
                    it narrows to a breadth of between 1 and 2 miles. The scenery of the river is
                    for the most part varied and beautiful, generally picturesque, and in many
                    places in the highest degree striking and magnificent. In the upper part the
                    views though not tame are a little monotonous, the gently sloping hills, with
                    the variegated colours of wood and cultivated land and the occasional occurrence
                    of a town or village, repeating one another without any marked feature to break
                    their regularity. Below Troy, for a considerable distance, the number of islands
                    renders much care in navigation necessary. Thirty miles from Troy noble views
                    begin to be obtained of the Catskill mountains, towering up on the west bank,
                    the nearest eminence at the distance of about 7 miles. Forty-six miles below
                    Catskill is the large and flourishing city of Poughkeepsie, and 14 miles further
                    down the prosperous city of Newburgh, a short distance below which, at the
                    favourite summer resort of Cornwall Landing, the river enters the Highlands,
                    passing between a series of hills whose frequently precipitous sides rise often
                    abruptly from the water’s edge. The views in this part of the river are of a
                    character in some respects unparalleled, and at several points they have an
                    impressiveness and surprising grandeur rarely equalled. The distance through
                    which the river traverses this mountain scenery is about 16 miles, and about 10
                    miles after it is entered West Point is reached, a favourite landing place of
                    tourists, the seat of the United States military academy, and historically
                    interesting on account of Fort Putnam, now in ruins, built during the war of
                    American independence, at which time a chain was stretched across the river to
                    prevent the passage of British ships. After passing the pretty town of Peekskill
                    the river widens into Haverstraw Bay, at the extremity of which is the headland
                    of Croton Point. Below is the wider expanse of Tappan Bay, upon which stands
                    Tarrytown, famous both historically and from <pb break="no"

                    cottage of Sunnyside is in the vicinity. At Piermont, where the bay ends, the
                    range named the Palisades rises picturesquely from the water to the height of
                    between 300 and 500 feet, extending along the west bank for about 20 miles, the
                    left bank being level and dotted with hamlets and villas. At the mouth of the
                    river on the west bank are Hoboken and Jersey city, and on the east bank New
                    York city.</p>
                <p>By the Erie canal the river is connected with Lake Erie, by the Champlain canal
                    with Lake Champlain, and by the Delaware canal with the Delaware river; and its
                    commercial importance as a means of traffic is not excelled by that of any other
                    river in the world. It was on the Hudson that Fulton, the inventor of steam
                    navigation, made his first successful experiment. The Hudson River Railway
                    skirts the east bank of the river from New York to Troy, whence it bends
                    eastward on its way to Lake Champlain. On the west bank a railway is to run from
                    Jersey City to Newburg, and branch lines from various centres touch both banks
                    at several points. The Hudson has some valuable fisheries, the principal fish
                    being bass, shad, and sturgeon. The attempts to stock it with salmon have not
                    been very successful. Though Verrazzani in 1524 proceeded up the river Hudson a
                    short distance in a boat, the first to demonstrate its extent and importance was
                    Henry Hudson, from whom it derives its name. He sailed above the mouth of the
                    Mohawk in September 1609.</p>
