                    a political satirist and a writer on antiquarian and miscellaneous subjects, was
                    born at Bath, June 3, 1780. His father, a man of deep spiritual experience in
                    that time of religious revival, brought up his children in strictness and
                    reverence, but not without the sectarian narrowness that so frequently produces
                    reaction. The parodist of the litany and of the Athânasian creed was taught to
                    read from the Bible only. Hone received no systematic education. His father
                    having removed to London in 1783, he was in 1790 placed in an attorney’s office.
                    Becoming connected with the London Corresponding Society, which was given to
                    freethought and to political agitation, he was removed by his father to the
                    office of a solicitor at Chatham, but after two years and a half he returned to
                    London and became clerk to a solicitor in Gray’s Inn. Having no liking for the
                    study of the law, and apparently no hope of succeeding in it, Hone, being then
                    married, started in 1800 a book and print shop and a circulating library in
                    Lambeth Walk, and he soon after removed to St Martin’s Churchyard, where he
                    brought out his first publication, Shaw’s <hi rend="italic">Gardener,</hi> and
                    suffered much loss from a fire. It was at this time that Hone matured and with a
                    friend endeavoured to realize a plan for the establishment of popular savings
                    banks, and even had an interview on the subject with the Right Hon. George Rose,
                    then president of the Board of Trade. This scheme, however, fell through from
                    lack of support. His partner in the savings bank became next his partner in a
                    bookseller’s business; but Hone’s habits were not those of a tradesman, and
                    bankruptcy was the result. After several removals, having compiled an index to
                    Lord Berner’s translation of Froissart, he was in 1811 chosen by the booksellers
                    as auctioneer to the trade, and had an office in Ivy Lane. Independent
                    investigations carried on by him into the condition of lunatic asylums led again
                    to difficulties and failure, but, struggling bravely under his burdens, he took
                    a small lodging in the Old Bailey, and kept himself and his now large family by
                    contributions to magazines and reviews. He hired a small shop (or rather box) in
                    Fleet Street, but this was on two separate nights broken into, and valuable
                    books lent for show were stolen. In 1815 he started the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traveller</hi> newspaper, and endeavoured vainly to exculpate Eliza Fenning, a
                    poor girl, apparently quite guiltless, executed on a charge of poisoning. From
                    February 1 to October 25, 1817, he published the <hi rend="italic"
                    >liefen</hi><hi rend="italic">mist</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Register,</hi>
                    writing in it as the serious critic of the state abuses, to which he soon after
                    applied the lash of satire in those political squibs and parodies that made his
                    name known throughout the land, and that first gave notoriety to George
                    Cruikshank, who was his artistic collaborator. In April 1817 three <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> informations were filed against him by the
                    attorney-general, Sir William Garrow, and he was seized while reading in the
                    street and hurried to the lock-up. Three separate trials took place in the
                    Guildhall before special juries on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of December 1817.
                    The first, for publishing Wilkes’s <hi rend="italic">Catechism of a Ministerial
                    Member,</hi> was before Mr Justice Abbot (afterwards Lord Tenterden); the
                    second, for parodying the litany and libelling the prince regent, and the third,
                    for publishing the <hi rend="italic">Sinecurist's Creed,</hi> a parody on the
                    Athanasian creed, were before Lord Ellenborough. The prosecuting officials,
                    among whom we must include the judges, took the ground that the prints were
                    calculated to injure public morals, and to bring the prayer-book and even
                    religion itself into contempt. But there can be no doubt that the real motives
                    of the prosecution were political; Hone had ridiculed the habits and exposed the
                    corruption of the prince regent and of other persons in power. He went to the
                    root of the matter when he wished the jury “to understand that, had he been a
                    publisher of ministerial parodies, he would not then have been defending himself
                    on the floor of that court.” In spite of illness and exhaustion Hone displayed
                    great courage, ability, dignity, and presence of mind. On each of the three days
                    he spoke on an average seven hours. Notwithstanding the powerful prosecution and
                    the bias of the judges, he was acquitted on each count, and the result on each
                    occasion was received with enthusiastic cheers by immense crowds within and
                    without the court. Soon after the trials a public meeting, in which Aiderman
                    Waithman, Sir F. Burdett, and Lord Cochrane took part, was held, and a
                    subscription was begun, by which a large sum was soon collected to enable Hone
                    to get over the difficulties caused by his prosecution.</p>
                <p>Hone’s most successful political satires were published within a few years after
                    his trial. Among them we may mention <hi rend="italic">The Political House that
                    Jack built, The Queen's Matrimonial Ladder</hi> (in favour of Queen Caroline),
                    <hi rend="italic">The Man in the Moon, The Political Showman,</hi> all
                    illustrated by Cruikshank. Many of his squibs are directed against a certain “Dr
                    Slop,” a nickname given by him to Dr (afterwards Sir John) Stoddart, a writer in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi> In researches for his defence he had come upon
                    some curious and at that time little trodden literary ground, and the results
                    were shown by his publication in 1820 of his <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal New
                    Testament,</hi> and in 1823 of his <hi rend="italic">Ancient Mysteries
                    Explained.</hi> He proposed in 1820 to write a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Parody,</hi> but this never appeared. In 1826 he published the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Every-day Book,</hi> in 1827-8 the <hi rend="italic">Table-Book,</hi> and in
                    1829 the <hi rend="italic">Year-Book ∙,</hi> all three were collections of
                    curious information on manners, antiquities, and various other subjects.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to a recent writer
                    in <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi> (6th S. i. 171), Hone remarked in
                    conversation that he took the idea of the <hi rend="italic">Everyday Book</hi>
                    in 1814 from Defoe’s <hi rend="italic">Times Telescope.</hi></p></note> These
                    are the works by which Hone is best remembered. In preparing them he had the
                    warm approval of Southey and the assistance of Charles Lamb, but pecuniarily
                    they were not successful, and Hone was lodged in King’s Bench prison for debt.
                    Friends, however, again came to his assistance, and he was established in a
                    coffee-house in Gracechurch Street; but this again, like most of his
                    enterprises, ended in failure. Hone’s attitude of mind had gradually changed to
                    that of extreme devoutness, and during the latter years of his life he
                    frequently preached in Weigh House Chapel, Eastcheap. In 1830 he edited Strutt’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Sports and Pastimes,</hi> and, on the starting in 1832 of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Penny Magazine,</hi> he contributed to the first number. He
                    was also for some years sub-editor of the <hi rend="italic">Patriot.</hi> He
                    died at Tottenham, 8th November 1842.</p>
