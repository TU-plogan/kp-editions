                    (1488-1523), is one of those men who, like Erasmus or Pirckheimer, form the
                    bridge between Humanists and Reformers. He lived with both, sympathized with
                    both, though he died before the Reformation had time fully to develop itself.
                    His life may be divided into four parts:—his youth and cloister-life (1488-
                    1504); his wanderings in pursuit of knowledge (1504- 1515); his strife with
                    Ulrich of Würtemburg (1515-1519); and his connexion with the Reformation
                    (1519-1523). Each of these periods had its own special antagonism, which
                    coloured Hutten’s career: in the first, his horror of dull monastic routine; in
                    the second, the ill-treatment he met with at Greifswald; in the third, the crime
                    of Duke Ulrich; in the fourth, his disgust with Rome and with Erasmus. He was
                    born April 21, 1488, at the castle of Steckelberg, near Fulda, in Franconia, the
                    eldest son of a poor and not undistinguished knightly family. As he was mean of
                    stature and sickly his father destined him for the cloister, and he was sent to
                    the Benedictine house at Fulda; the thirst for learning there seized on him, and
                    in 1504 he fled from the monastic life, and won his freedom with the sacrifice
                    of his worldly prospects, and at the cost of incurring his father’s undying
                    anger. From the Fulda cloister he went first to Cologne, next to Erfurt, and
                    then to Frankfort-on-the-Oder on the opening in 1506 of the new university of
                    that town; there in that year he appears to have graduated in philosophy. When,
                    however, the scholastic party displaced the Humanists, he wandered forth again;
                    in 1508 we find him a shipwrecked beggar on the Pomeranian coast. In 1509 the
                    university of Greifswald welcomed him; “Ulricus Huttenus poeta clericus
                    Herbipolensis gratis intitulatus quia spoliatus omnibus bonis” is the honourable
                    record on the books of this his second Alma Mater. Here too the friends who at
                    first received him so kindly became his foes; the sensitive ill-regulated youth,
                    who took the liberties of genius, wearied his burgher patrons; they could not
                    brook the poet’s airs and vanity, and ill-timed assertions of his higher rank.
                    Wherefore he left Greifswald, and as he went was robbed of clothes and books,
                    his only baggage, by the servants of his late friends; in the dead of winter,
                    half starved, frozen, penniless, he reached Rostock. Here again the Humanists,
                    who were throughout full of charity and sympathy towards the luckless young
                    scholar, received him gladly, and under their protection he wrote against his
                    Greifswald patrons, thus beginning the long list of his satires and fierce
                    attacks on personal or public foes. Rostock could not hold him long; he wandered
                    on to Wittenberg and Leipsic, and thence to Vienna, where he hoped to catch the
                    emperor Maximilian’s favour by an elaborate national poem on the war with
                    Venice. But neither Maximilian nor the university of Vienna would lift hand for
                    him, and he passed into Italy, that holy land of Humanist enthusiasm, where, at
                    Pavia, he sojourned throughout 1511 and part of 1512. In the latter year his
                    studies were rudely interrupted by war; in the siege of Pavia by papal troops
                    and Swiss, he was plundered by both sides, and escaped sick and penniless to
                    Bologna; on his recovery he even took service as a private soldier in the
                    emperor’s army.</p>
                <p>This dark period lasted no long time; in 1514 he was again in Germany, where,
                    thanks to his poetic gifts and the friendship of Eitelwolf von Stein, he won the
                    favour of the elector of Mainz, Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg. Here high
                    dreams of a learned career rose on him; Mainz should be made the metropolis of a
                    grand Humanist movement<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0428-0413"/>, the centre of good style and literary form. This
                    golden dream was scattered by the murder in 1515 of his cousin John of Hutten by
                    Ulrich, duke of Wiirtemburg. This outrage changed the whole course of Hutten’s
                    life; satire, chief refuge of the weak, became his weapon; with one hand he took
                    his part in the famous <hi rend="italic">Hpistoloe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Obscurorum Virorum,</hi> and with the other launched scathing letters, eloquent
                    Ciceronian orations, or biting satires against the duke. Though the emperor was
                    too lazy and indifferent to smite a great prince, he condescended to bestow on
                    Hutten the inexpensive honour of a laureate crown in 1517; as the poet tells us
                    with pleased pride, the wreath was woven by the hands of fair Constantia, Conrad
                    Peutinger’s daughter. As recognized poet laureate of Germany, Hutten, who had
                    been to Italy, again attached himself to the electoral court at Mainz; and he
                    was there when in 1518 his true friend Pirckheimer wrote, urging him to abandon
                    the court and dedicate himself to letters. We have the poet’s long reply, in an
                    epistle on his “way of life,” an amusing mixture of earnestness and vanity,
                    self-satisfaction and satire; he tells his friend that his career is just begun,
                    that he has had twelve years of wandering, and will now enjoy himself a while in
                    patriotic literary work; that he has by no means deserted the humaner studies,
                    but carries with him a little library of standard books. Pirckheimer in his
                    burgher life may have ease and even luxury; he, a knight of the empire, how can
                    he condescend to obscurity? He must abide where he can shine. And so, dazzled by
                    his dream of an intellectual reform, Hutten chose the path which presently led
                    him to his ruin.</p>
                <p>In 1519 he issued in one volume his attacks on Duke Ulrich, and then, drawing
                    sword, took part in the private war which overthrew that prince; in this affair
                    he became intimate with Franz von Sickingen, the champion of the knightly order
                    (Ritterstand). Henceforth Hutten takes part in the Lutheran movement, while he
                    becomes mixed up in the attempt of the “Ritterstand” to recover its position,
                    and to assert itself as the militia of the empire against the independence of
                    the German princes. It was soon after this time that he discovered at Fulda a
                    copy of the manifesto of the emperor Henry IV. against Hildebrand, and published
                    it with comments as an attack on the papal claims over Germany. He hoped thereby
                    to interest the new emperor Charles V., and the higher orders in the empire, in
                    behalf of German liberties; but the appeal failed. What Luther had achieved by
                    speaking to cities and common folk in homely phrase, because he touched heart
                    and conscience, that the far finer weapons of Hutten failed to effect, because
                    he tried to touch the more cultivated sympathies and dormant patriotism of
                    princes and bishops, nobles and knights. And so he at on,ce gained an undying
                    name in the republic of letters and ruined his own career. He showed that the
                    artificial verse-making of the Humanists could be connected with the new
                    outburst of genuine German poetry. The Minnesinger was gone; the new national
                    singer, a Luther or a Hans Sachs, was heralded by the stirring lines of Hutten’s
                    pen. These form a distinct epoch in the history of German national literature;
                    they have in them a splendid n ιtural swing and ring, strong and patriotic,
                    though unfortunately addressed to knight and landsknecht rather than to the
                    German people.</p>
                <p>The poet’s high dream of a knightly national regeneration had a rude awakening.
                    The attack on the papacy, and Luther’s vast and sudden popularity, frightened
                    Elector Albert, who dismissed Hutten from his court. Hoping for imperial favour,
                    he betook himself to Charles V.; but that cold young prince, who cared little
                    for Humanists, and was not a German, would have none of him. So he returned to
                    his friends, and they rejoiced greatly to see him still alive; for Pope Leo X,
                    had ordered him to be arrested and sent to Rome, and assassins dogged his steps.
                    He now attached himself more closely to Franz von Sickingen and the knightly
                    movement. This also came to a disastrous end in the capture of the Ebernberg,
                    and Sickingen’s death; the higher nobles had triumphed; the archbishops avenged
                    themselves on Lutheranism as interpreted by the knightly order. With Sickingen
                    Hutten also finally fell. He fled to Basel, where Erasmus refused to see the
                    sick hero, both for fear of his loathsome diseases, and also because the
                    beggared knight was sure to borrow money from him. A paper war consequently
                    broke out between the two Humanists, which embittered Hutten’s last days, and
                    stained the memory of Erasmus. From Basel Ulrich dragged his limbs to Mulhausen;
                    and when the vengeance of Erasmus drove him thence, he went to Zurich. There the
                    large heart of Zwingli welcomed him; he helped him with money, and found him a
                    quiet refuge with the pastor of the little isle of Ufnau on the Zurich Lake.
                    There thé frail and worn-out poet, writing swift satire to the end, fell a
                    victim to his infirmities, and died (29th August 1523) at the age of
                    thirty-five. He left behind him some debts due to compassionate friends; he did
                    not even own a single book, and all his goods amounted to the clothes on his
                    back, a bundle of letters, and that valiant pen which had fought so many a sharp
                    battle, and had won for the poor knight-errant a sure place in the annals of
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Ulrich von Hutten is one of those men of genius at whom propriety is shocked, and
                    whom the mean-spirited avoid. Yet through his short and buffeted life he was
                    befriended, with wonderful charity and patience, by the chief leaders of the
                    Humanist movement. For, in spite of his irritable vanity, his immoral life and
                    habits, his odious diseases, his painful restlessness, Hutten had much in him
                    that strong men could love. He passionately loved the truth, and was ever open
                    to all good influences. He was a patriot, whose soul yearned for what was high,
                    and soared to ideal schemes and a grand utopian restoration of his country. In
                    spite of all, his was a frank and noble nature; his faults chiefly the faults of
                    genius ill-controlled, and of a life cast in the eventful changes of an age of
                    novelty. A swarm of writings issued from his pen; at first the smooth elegance
                    of his Latin prose and verse seemed strangely to miss his real character; he was
                    the Cicero and Ovid of Germany before he became its Lucian.</p>
                <p>His chief works were his <hi rend="italic">Ars versificandi</hi> (1511); the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemo,</hi> (1518); a work on the <hi rend="italic">Morbus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gallicus</hi> (1519); the volume of Steckelberg complaints against
                    Duke Ulrich (including his four <hi rend="italic">Ciceronian Orations,</hi> his
                    <hi rend="italic">Betters,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phalarisrnus)</hi>
                    also in 1519; the <hi rend="italic">Vadismus</hi> (1520); and the controversy
                    with Erasmus at the end of his life. Besides these were many admirable poems in
                    Latin and German. It will never be known with certainty how far Hutten was the
                    parent of the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Epistolae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Obscurorum Virorum,</hi> that famous satire on monastic ignorance as
                    represented by the theologians of Cologne with which the friends of Reuchlin
                    defended him. At first the cloister-world, not discerning its irony, welcomed
                    the work as a defence of their position; though their eyes were soon opened by
                    the favour with which the learned world received it. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolae</hi> were eagerly bought up; the first part (41 letters) appeared at
                    the end of 1515; early in 1516 there was a second edition; later in 1516 a
                    third, with an appendix of seven letters; in 1517 appeared the second part (62
                    letters), to which a fresh appendix of eight letters was subjoined soon after.
                    Hutten, in a letter addressed to Robert Crocus, denied that he was the author,
                    and is followed by Bayle in his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi>; but there is
                    no doubt as to his direct connexion with the book. Erasmus λvas of opinion that
                    there were three authors, of whom Crotus Rubianus was the originator of the
                    idea, and Hutten a chief contributor. D. F. Strauss, who dedicates to the
                    subject a chapter of his admirable work on Hutten, concludes that he had no
                    share in the first part, but that his hand is clearly visible in the second
                    part, which he attributes in the main to him. To him is due the more serious and
                    severe tone of that bitter portion of the satire.</p>
