                <p><label type="entry">HYDROPATHY</label> is the treatment of disease by water, used
                    outwardly and inwardly. Like many descriptive names, the word “hydropathy” is
                    defective and even misleading, the active agents in the treatment being heat and
                    cold, of which water is little more than the vehicle, and not the only one.
                    Thermo-therapeutics (or thermotherapy) is a term less open to objection. The
                    name “hydropathy,” however, as being itself an advance on an earlier and less
                    happy designation, “the water cure,” as having obtained general currency, is
                    here employed.</p>
                <p>Hydropathy, as a system, or mode of treatment complete in itself, dates from
                    about 1829, when Vincenz Priessnitz (1801-51), a farmer of Gräfenberg in
                    Silesia, Austria, began his public career in the paternal homestead, extended so
                    as to accommodate the increasing numbers attracted by the fame of his cures. Two
                    English works, however, on the medical uses of water had been translated into
                    German in the century preceding the rise of the movement under Priessnitz. One
                    of these was by Sir John Floyer, a physician of Lichfield, who, struck by the
                    remedial use of certain springs by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the
                    history of cold bathing, and published in 1702 his “Ψυχρολουσία, <hi
                    rend="italic">or the History of Cold Bathing, both Ancient and Modern."</hi> The
                    book ran through six editions within a few years, and the translation was
                    largely drawn upon by Dr J. S. Hahn of Silesia, in a work published in 1738, <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Healing Virtues of Cold Water, Inwardly and Outwardly
                    applied, as proved by Experience.</hi> The other work was that of Dr Currie of
                    Liverpool, entitled <hi rend="italic">Medical Reports on the Effects of Water,
                    Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fevers and other Diseases,</hi> published in 1797,
                    and soon after translated into German by Michaeb’s (1801) and Hegewisch (1807).
                    It was highly popular, and first placed the subject on a scientific basis.
                    Hahn’s writings had meanwhile created much enthusiasm among his countrymen,
                    societies having been everywhere formed to promote the medicinal and dietetic
                    use of water; and in 1804 Professor Oertel of Ansbach republished them and
                    quickened the popular movement by unqualified commendation of water drinking as
                    a remedy for all diseases. In him the rising Priessnitz found a zealous
                    advocate, and doubtless an instructor also. The origin of hydropathy is thus to
                    be traced to an English source and to the medical profession. The broad
                    conception that water had curative relations to the whole realm of disease seems
                    to have been first grasped by a Capuchin monk of Sicily, Father Bernardo, who,
                    at Malta, in 1724, obtained results by iced water alone, which, according to
                    Hahn, caused a great stir throughout Europe; but, owing to the excesses of his
                    imitators, it was of no long duration. With this exception there is, as regards
                    the remedial use of water, nothing in the history <pb break="no"

                    system of Priessnitz, though much leading up to it can be discovered. Among most
                    primitive peoples, indeed, both in the Old and in the New World, the existence
                    of one kind or another of hydropathic practice can be traced; and the fathers of
                    medicine made frequent reference in their writings to the employment of water.
                    The warm bath came into use at an early period (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Baths,</hi> vol. iii. p. 434); and the clyster, shower bath, douche, plunge,
                    wet compress, drop bath, head and foot baths, are mentioned from time to time,
                    as also combinations of heat and cold and primitive modes of sweating, until,
                    before the end of the 17 th century, all the processes of modern hydropathy, the
                    wet sheet pack and induced cutaneous crisis alone excepted, had become known and
                    were in a measure practised. Prominent in the roll of names associated more or
                    less with the advocacy of water in earlier times are those of Asclepiades of
                    Prusa (90 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> surnamed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ψυχρολοντης</hi> (“cold bather”), Antoninus Musa (30 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), famed for his cure of Augustus by cold water (comp. Hoc., <hi
                    rend="italic">Epist.</hi> i. 15, 3-5), Galen (130 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of Marseilles (1755) gained a prize for the best treatise on the applications of
                    cold water in disease, and another prize essay by Marteau shows what knowledge
                    of the subject prevailed in his time.</p>
                <p>At Gräfenberg, to which the fame of Priessnitz drew people of every rank and many
                    countries, medical men were conspicuous by their numbers, some being attracted
                    by curiosity, others by the desire of knowledge, but the majority by the hope of
                    cure for ailments which had as yet proved incurable. Many records of experiences
                    at Gräfenberg were published, all more or less favourable to the claims of
                    Priessnitz, and some enthusiastic in their estimate of his genius and
                    penetration; and from these alone can a knowledge of his practice and views be
                    obtained, not a line having ever been written by this singular man. To Captain
                    Claridge was due the introduction in 1840 of hydropathy to England, his writings
                    and lectures, and later those of Drs Wilson, Gully, and Edward Johnson, making
                    numerous converts, and filling the establishments opened soon after at Malvern
                    and elsewhere. In Germany, France, and America hydropathic establishments
                    multiplied with great rapidity. Antagonism ran high between the old practice and
                    the new. Unsparing condemnation was heaped by each on the other; and a legal
                    prosecution, leading to a royal commission of inquiry, served but to make
                    Priessnitz and his system stand higher in public estimation.</p>
                <p>But increasing popularity diminished before long that timidity which hitherto had
                    in great measure prevented trial of the new method from being made on the weaker
                    and more serious class of cases, and had caused hydropathists to occupy
                    themselves mainly with a sturdy order of chronic invalids well able to bear a
                    rigorous regimen and the severities of unrestricted crisis. The need of a
                    radical adaptation to the former class was first adequately recognized by John
                    Smedley, a manufacturer of Derbyshire, who, impressed in his own person with the
                    severities as well as the benefits of “the cold water cure,” practised among his
                    workpeople a milder form of hydropathy, and began about 1852 a new era in its
                    history, founding at Matlock a counterpart of the establishment,at
                    Gräfenberg.</p>
                <p>Whilst hydropathy as a system has been gaining favour with the people, and
                    receiving ample acknowledgment from the more liberal members of the medical
                    profession, individual measures have from time to time been advocated in the
                    medical journals and adopted more or less widely in particular diseases. Brand
                    of Berlin, Räljen and Jürgensen of Kiel, and Liebermeister of Basel, between
                    1860 and 1870, employed the cooling bath in abdominal typhus with results which,
                    after every deduction on the score of defective classification had been made,
                    were striking enough, and led to its introduction to England by Dr Wilson Fox,
                    whose able monograph commanded general acceptance. In the Franco-German war the
                    cooling bath was largely employed, in conjunction frequently with quinine; and
                    it now holds a recognized position in the treatment of hyperpyrexia. The wet
                    sheet pack has of late been much used in fevers of all kinds both in private and
                    hospital practice; and the Turkish bath, introduced about twenty-four years ago
                    by Mr David Urquhart on his return from the East, and ardently adopted by Mr
                    Barter of Cork, has become a public institution, and, with the “morning tub” and
                    the general practice of water drinking, is the most noteworthy of the many
                    contributions by hydropathy to public health.</p>
                <p>The theoretical basis of hydropathy is wide and fundamental enough to include
                    within its scope all disease« Each individual cell of the mass constituting in
                    various forms and combinations the human body being in its growth and function
                    dependent on and regulated by the nervous and vascular systems, themselves
                    cellular, and every derangement of these cells originating in or being.attended
                    with a derangement of their nervous and vascular supply, and that supply being
                    powerfully and in quite diverse ways influenced by heat and cold,—all morbid
                    conditions of the economy may be influenced materially by the regulated
                    employment of heat and cold, which are entitled therefore to rank as powerful
                    factors in therapeutics.</p>
                <p>Hydropathy insists in quite a special way on the necessity of regarding disease
                    first in relation to its cause. It next requires that whatever assistance may be
                    afforded to the <hi rend="italic">vis medicatrix</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naturoe</hi> should in the first place be similar in kind (⅛'.e., should be
                    natural or physiological), rather than alien to it and drawn from sources remote
                    and strange; and, while proceeding on lines which have been common to all
                    medical practice from an early period, it does so by agents hitherto strangely
                    neglected, though not unknown, and effects its purpose in ways less open to
                    objection than those it would displace. For example, when local depletion is
                    required, as of the lung in pneumonia, or the brain in haemorrhagic apoplexy,
                    the final withdrawal from the general circulation of a quantity of blood is
                    deprecated as unnecessary for the attainment of the object in view, and
                    prejudicial in the after period of convalescence. Hydropathy substitutes a
                    diversion to parts indifferent, as the extremities and general cutaneous
                    surface, and so material and sustained as tobe much more effectual; while at the
                    same time it holds in reserve the abstracted blood to perform its part in the
                    restoration of strength. Where purgation is employed to derive blood from the
                    brain, liver, or kidneys, a highly sensitive and vital membrane is more or less
                    injured thereby, and convalescence proportionately imperilled. Hydropathy
                    selects the skin as more accessible than the mucous membrane of the alimentary
                    tract, more serviceable also, and less, if at all, susceptible of injury, either
                    temporary or permanent. The skin can with safety be used for counter-irritation,
                    and is a reservoir of capacity almost unlimited, into which to divert the excess
                    of blood from the brain or other part, while for purposes of excretion it is not
                    inferior to the bowels themselves, and, unlike the latter, is left even more
                    efficient than before. In the febrile state, a reduction of pulse and
                    temperature, and relief from pain and sleeplessness, were commonly attempted, at
                    the period when hydropathy was introduced, by depressants, as antimony,
                    ipecacuanha, and perhaps large doses of alcohol, in combination with sedatives,
                    as opium and chloral. Impaired digestion and depressed vitality were results in
                    some measure inevitable, and always of moment, especially in the more protracted
                    fevers, where recovery becomes a question often of simple physical endurance. By
                    means of the wet <pb break="no"

                    allied measures, these ends are attained with comparative ease, certainty, and
                    simplicity, and with entire freedom from objectionable secondary effects.</p>
                <p>The agents of hydropathy are at once simple and complex,—simple in their
                    elements, and complex in their combinations and modifications. They afford the
                    physician a series of effects almost infinite in variety, both in kind and in
                    degree, both immediate and remote. According as heat and cold<note

                    iii. ρ. 440).</p></note> are used in their extreme or their intermediate
                    degrees, singly or in combination, successively or alternately, momentarily or
                    continuously, dry or moist, and according as the primary action is utilized or
                    the secondary, do their effects differ. The direct or primary effect of cold is
                    to depress, cool, and deplete the part concerned. If its exhibition is brief,
                    reaction (an important factor in hydropathic practice) quickly establishes an
                    opposite condition, stimulating the part, and determining an increased flow of
                    blood to it, with increase of its temperature and vital activity. If it is
                    continuous, the primary depression is maintained, and the revulsive or secondary
                    effect delayed or averted. The direct effect of heat is to increase the amount
                    of blood present; but if the exhibition is brief, and evaporation is permitted,
                    the contrary effect is produced, viz., depression, coolness, and depletion; if
                    it is continuous, the primary effect is preserved. Thus with truth it may be
                    said that cold heats and heat cools, while the converse holds good, and that by
                    simple variations of detail. From the intermediate temperatures (80° to 100°)
                    simple sedative effects are obtained, with absence of secondary or revulsive
                    effects in proportion as the temperature of the part is approximated to. Results
                    vary also according to the heat of the subject. In local inflammations,
                    continuous cold benumbs and contracts, continuous heat soothes and relaxes.
                    Momentary cold excites, heats by reaction, and intensifies inflammation; while
                    momentary heat soothes and ultimately cools the inflamed part by the after
                    evaporation. In the earlier stages and acute varieties of inflammation,
                    therefore, continuous cold or transient hot applications are appropriate, and
                    brief applications of cold in the later, congestive, and chronic forms. But
                    where the local inflammation coexists with general feverishness, continuous cold
                    as the local application is preferable, helping, as it does, to reduce the
                    general exaltation of temperature. In collapse the low general temperature makes
                    heat the best local application. On internal parts the application of heat and
                    cold externally has definite therapeutic effects either identical or opposite
                    (as remarked by John Hunter) through reflex or sympathetic nervous action.
                    Through the vascular system also remote effects are produced, as in heating the
                    lower extremities to derive blood from the brain. The counter relation also of
                    the entire cutaneous surface to the internal organs, as the kidneys and
                    alimentary mucous membrane, is, in hydropathy, largely utilized for remedial
                    purposes. This sympathy is familiar enough in the etiology of disease, which may
                    be said likewise of all the physiological laws applied to curative purposes in
                    hydropathy.</p>

                    ageneralbath administered. The pack is a derivative, sedative, sudorific, and
                    stimulator of cutaneous excretion. There are numerous modifications of it,
                    notably the cooling pack, where the wrappings are loose and scanty, permitting
                    evaporation, and the application of indefinite duration, the sheet being
                    rewetted as it dries; this is of great value in protracted febrile conditions.

                    through the extremes of heat and cold, is an effective nervous and vascular
                    stimulant and tonic. Morbid growths and secretions, as also the uraemic, gouty,
                    and rheumatic diathesis, are beneficially influenced by it. The full pack and
                    Turkish bath have between them usurped the place and bettered the function of
                    the once familiar hot bath. The Russian or steam bath and the lamp bath are
                    primitive and inferior varieties of the modern Turkish bath, the atmosphere of
                    which cannot be too dry and pure.</p>
                <p>(c.) General baths comprise the rain (or needle), spray (or rose), shower,
                    shallow, plunge, douche, wave, and common morning sponge baths, with the
                    dripping sheet, and hot and cold spongings, and are combinations, as a rule, of
                    hot and cold water. They are stimulating, tonic, derivative, and detergent.</p>
                <p>(&lt;Z.) Local baths comprise the sitz (or sitting), douche (or spouting),
                    spinal, foot, and head baths, of hot or cold water, singly or in combination,
                    successive or alternate. The sitz, head, and foot baths are used “flowing” on
                    occasion. Rapid alternations of hot and cold water have a powerful effect in
                    vascular stasis and lethargy of the nervous system and absorbents, yielding
                    valuable results in local congestions and chronic inflammations.</p>
                <p>(e.) Bandages (or compresses) are of two kinds,— <hi rend="italic">cooling,</hi>
                    of wet material left exposed for evaporation, used in local inflammations and
                    fevers; and <hi rend="italic">heating,</hi> of the same, covered with waterproof
                    material, used in congestion, external or internal, for short or long periods.
                    Poultices, warm, of bread, linseed, bran, &amp;c., changed but twice in
                    twenty-four hours, are identical in action with the heating bandage, and
                    superior only in the greater warmth and consequent vital activity their closer
                    application to the skin ensures.</p>
                <p>(∕.) Fomentations and poultices, hot or cold, sinapisms, stupes, rubefacients,
                    irritants, frictions, kneadings, calisthenics, gymnastics, electricity, &amp;c.,
                    are adjuncts largely employed in hydropathic practice. Water drinking, while
                    still an important factor in hydropathy, has declined somewhat since the early
                    times of the system.</p>
                <p>But that which has from the first distinguished modern hydropathy, and still
                    makes its strict practice a thing apart, is the “crisis” so called. It is
                    related of Priessnitz that, when a boy'of fourteen, and treating a sprain, as
                    was the native custom, with wet cloths, he observed an eruption appear beneath
                    them, with immediate recovery of the part. Gradually the significance and wider
                    application of this eruption dawned upon him, until it came to hold so prominent
                    a place in his practice as to be regarded by many as his greatest discovery. The
                    eruption coinciding in point of time with recovery as a rule, it was called the
                    crisis, involving doubtless a reference to the term as used by Hippocrates and
                    his successors. But with Priessnitz crisis attained a higher rank, a wider
                    application, and a more definite character. He first showed it to be producible
                    at will under given conditions of the patient, and amenable to direction and
                    control. This eruption, it is claimed, appears only in morbid states of the
                    blood (cachexia) resulting from derangement or defect in the organs of
                    assimilation or excretion or both <hi rend="italic">{p.g.,</hi> gout,
                    rheumatism), or from the presence of a specific poison <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> syphilis). The continuous application to a given tract of skin of
                    the heating bandage or poultice (mediums merely for the exhibition of warmth and
                    moisture) stimulates, in a cumulative way, its vascular and nervous activity,
                    and leads, it may be in a few days or weeks (in some cases hours, in others
                    months), to an eruption, papular, then pustular, and ultimately resolving itself
                    into a suppurating surface commensurate with the area covered by the bandage.
                    There is, in the latter stage, a copious discharge of yellowish-green pus,
                    usually foetid, varied occasionally with patches of brown, blue, or metallic
                    green, and accompanied with itching, sometimes intense. The general temperature
                    is not, as a rule, disturbed; the pulse, except perhaps for the first day or
                    two, falls, if previously quick, to a natural rate; the weight and strength, in
                    the most favourable cases from the outset, and in the rest later on, increase,
                    and it is not uncommon to find the anomaly of a patient exulting in freedom from
                    suffering and a return of the impulses of health simultaneously with the
                    appearance of an extensive inflammation of the skin. The applications, continued
                    without intermission and unaltered (save as cleanliness requires) for weeks or
                    months, according to the nature of the case, are at last no more stained with
                    pus but with serum <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n560/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0560-0545"/> simply; and finally, still without change of
                    application, the skin will heal, or, at most, show a little psoriasis,
                    pityriasis, or eczema, or, it may be, but a faint tinge of red. The bandages are
                    then withdrawn. The original symptoms meanwhile have disappeared with more or
                    less celerity and completeness; and with the eruption has departed the disease
                    that called for it and made it possible. Strength grows apace, no longer taxed
                    by disease or crisis, until recovery in appropriate cases is absolute and
                    secure.</p>
                <p>Occasionally the cutaneous inflammation extends in the form of psoriasis, eczema,
                    sudamina, a papular rash, or a succession of boils, invading parts untouched by
                    the wet compress. This is called a general crisis; it usually occurs in the last
                    stage of the local one, sometimes after it has ceased, and is advantageous and
                    transient. Debility, whether pre-existing or consequent on the crisis, may call
                    for some modification of its severity and duration, whether by instalments at
                    proper intervals, or curtailment in the later stages, the natural emunctories
                    being relied on to complete the work of Surification at greater leisure. A
                    residuum of incurable organic egeneration, as of the kidneys or liver, may
                    likewise put limits to recovery, and provide perpetual material for crisis until
                    the patient is worn out in a vain and ignorant attempt at cure. It was the
                    failure of the earlier hydropathists—through inexperience, default of medical
                    education, or inordinate enthusiasm—to recognize these limitations, that brought
                    crisis into its present discredit and comparative desuetude. Where it is
                    necessary from these or other causes to relieve the patient of the eruption, the
                    substitution of simple ointment, unsalted lard, or other oleaginous or viscid
                    material for the stimulating bandages or poultices, permits the excitement to
                    subside, and, with occasional exceptions, the skin, in a few days, it may be
                    hours, bears little trace of the eruption.</p>
                <p>In the course of hydropathic treatment there occur, though rarely, attacks of
                    diarrhoea, sickness, diuresis, or diaphoresis, which, having been observed
                    frequently to mark the turning point in the history of the case, are held to be
                    varieties of crisis, disturbances attendant on the expulsion of the materies
                    morbi from the system.</p>
                <p>The theory of crisis may be stated thus. The digestive and assimilative organs
                    are, as is well known, involved, whether primarily or secondarily, in by far the
                    majority of morbid conditions. Theirproduct, the blood, undergoing constant
                    renewal, becomesneces-sarily more or less impaired,—deprived of the blandness
                    that pertains alone to a pure and perfect condition, with what may be termed an
                    inflammatory disposition as the result. The most familiar, because pronounced,
                    forms are the gouty, rheumatic, tubercular, and strumous diatheses. Later the
                    excretory organs, in common with the whole economy, must more or less become
                    deranged, with additions, in consequence, to the sum of morbid elements in the
                    blood, such as uraemic and biliary matters. A vicious circle of action and
                    reaction is established from which escape is difficult, if not impossible, in
                    its more pronounced developments. The digestive disorder begets imperfect and
                    impure blood, and the morbid blood keeps up, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >coeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus</hi> increases, the initial and
                    originating digestive disorder. In all but its most advanced stages ordinary
                    measures, hydropathic or other, may suffice to break this chain,'and, by
                    eliminating one or more of its links, render recovery possible, or accomplish
                    it. It is when the complication is beyond their reach that the domain peculiar
                    to crisis begins. The superior vascularity and vitality of the digestive
                    organs—the alimentary tract of mucous membrane, the pancreas, and the liver—is
                    what makes them (in addition to their susceptibility to injury through errors in
                    diet) so commonly the seat of diseased action. The highly nervous and vascular
                    structure of the skin makes easy its elevation to at least an equality in vital
                    activity with the mucous membrane. Warmth and moisture continuously applied to a
                    given portion will, in time, effect this, aided doubtless by maceration and
                    denudation of the cuticle and exposure of the sensitive cutis vera. It thus
                    becomes the seat of greatest vital activity; pre-eminence in morbid activity
                    naturally follows, and a genuine metastasis is effected, such as the natural
                    history of disease is rich in examples of. There is a decline, <hi rend="italic"
                    >pro</hi><hi rend="italic">tanto,</hi> of the primary internal disorder under
                    this combined pressure, first by the diversion of morbific elements, and then by
                    the diversion of an appreciable quantity of the blood itself, and by
                    counter-irritation, when the site of the vicarious inflammation has been
                    selected with that in view. The aid of a sustained derivation to the entire
                    cutaneous surface and the extremities is at the same time secured by means of
                    the Turkish bath, full packs, and other stimulating agents, while, at the same
                    time, due care is taken to eliminate and negative the original causes of
                    disease. The sum of morbid activity is for the time being increased and
                    intensified; but, in the new location, no longer self-supporting and
                    self-perpetuating, it is sooner or later exhausted. The change in the relation
                    of the matenes morbi to the digestive system puts an end at one and the same
                    time to the originating and sustaining conditions. The failure ot simple,
                    counter-irritation (where, as by sinapisms, vesicatories, <hi rend="italic">.
                    c∙</hi>, ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> irritant is derived from without) to
                    effect the same result m many of the cases afterwards cured by crisis negatives
                    of itself the view that the results of the latter are to be attributed to the
                    element in it of counter-irritation alone.</p>
