                    rear-admiral, and sent to co-operate with Sir George Rodney in the West Indies,
                    where he fought some indecisive actions with the Comte de Grasse. In July of the
                    following year he succeeded Rodney in the supreme command, shortly after which
                    the fleet set sail for America. Although ip January 1782 Hood failed to hold the
                    island of St Christopher’s against the superior forces of the French, he
                    succeeded in very difficult circumstances in preserving his fleet intact until
                    the arrival of Rodney, when he so distinguished himself in the action of the 9th
                    April and the more important one of the 12th, that for his services he was
                    created a peer of Ireland with the title of Baron Hood of Catherington. On
                    Rodney’s return home he was again promoted to the chief command, which he held
                    till peace was proclaimed in 1783. In 1784 Lord Hood successfully opposed
                    Charles Fox as parliamentary candidate for Westminster, and, though he lost his
                    seat on being made a lord of the admiralty in 1788, he regained it in 1790. On
                    the outbreak of war with France, after the Revolution, in 1793, he was appointed
                    to the command of the fleet in the Mediterranean, where he received the
                    surrender of Toulon from the French royalists. Before evacuating it to Napoleon
                    on December 18th, Hood burned the arsenal, and destroyed fifteen sail of the
                    line besides carrying off eight. In the following year he succeeded, after a
                    stubborn resistance, in expelling the French from Corsica; and after his return
                    lwme he was in 1796 appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital and raised to the
                    English peerage with the title of Viscount Hood of Whitley. In 1799 he was
                    promoted to the rank of admiral, and in 1804 he received the grand cross of the
                    bath. He died at Bath 27th June 1816. The achievements of Lord Hood, though not
                    of so brilliant a character as those of a Blake or a Nelson, were the result of
                    thorough seamanship, and of a rare union of courage and decision with coolness
                    and caution.</p>
