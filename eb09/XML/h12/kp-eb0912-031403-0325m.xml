                    only representatives of whatever varieties of hounds existed previously in
                    England. The staghound proper is practically extinct, no pack of them having
                    been kept since 1825, when the Devon and Somerset establishment was broken up
                    and the pack .sold. With the exception of Lord Wolverton’s black St Huberts, all
                    hounds now used foi stag-hunting are simply those of the foxhound breed entered
                    to deer instead of to fox. Most packs of staghounds are composed of hounds of
                    the ordinary size, but it is said thaf the present master of the Devon and
                    Somerset (1880} uses none under 25 inches, and excludes bitches altogether.</p>
                <p>The modern English foxhound is about as near perfection as he can well be, and
                    his excellence is all the more wonderful that less than 200 years ago there does
                    not seem to have been in existence any hound bearing a resemblance to him; for,
                    until fox hunting by hounds kepi for that especial purpose was instituted, there
                    could have been no reason to breed foxhounds. According to old writers on
                    hunting subjects, there appear to have been, amongst other varieties, the slow,
                    plodding, southern hound, with a great square head and wondrous powers of
                    working <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n326/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0326-0315"/> on a scent, and. the lighter northern hound; and
                    as all animals improve under the care and guidance of man, until they assume the
                    character of a distinct breed, it is clear that such has been the case with
                    foxhounds, the earlier breeders of which did their part towards the attainment
                    of perfection, by breeding with much care and. judgment from the best specimens
                    at their disposal. Older breeders were satisfied if the result of their
                    crossings possessed good noses, and were up to the standard of beauty of those
                    days; but the time came, in the days of the great Meynell, when pace had to be
                    added to the list of foxhound virtues, owing to the use of better bred horses in
                    the hunting field, and at the present day the development of pace without
                    sacrificing nose is one of the greatest difficulties a breeder has to contend
                    with.</p>
                <p>The mastership of a pack of foxhounds is an undertaking of great responsibility.
                    In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hunting</hi> mention is made of the
                    difficulties which beset a master when he takes the field; but after all, the
                    greatest exercise of judgment is called for in relation to the kennels, for upon
                    the master, in conjunction to a greater or less extent with the huntsman or
                    kennel huntsman, rests the responsibility of selecting suitable sires and dams
                    for the young hounds he intends to breed; of drafting such hounds as it is
                    thought desirable to part with owing to their being over or under sized, or
                    possessed of some failing; and of obtaining drafts from other establishments.
                    More than one opinion exists as to what is the proper size for a foxhound, but
                    some of the greatest authorities having expressed their conviction that from 21
                    to 22 inches for bitches and from 23 to 24 inches for dogs is the proper
                    standard, a master could hardly do wrong in adopting it. A hound’s head should
                    not be too large, nor, on the other hand, should it be too narrow, or else, like
                    the greyhound, he will possess speed, butbe deficient in nose. There was much
                    truth in Mr Warde’s remark, who, on overhearing a stranger finding fault with
                    his hounds for having such large heads, said, “Their knowledge boxes (as he
                    called them) are large, but size has this advantage, that when they once put
                    their noses down to the ground they cannot get their heads up again.” The neck
                    should be neither too short nor throaty; that is to say, there should be no
                    dewlap. The shoulder should slope like that of the horse, and there should be
                    plenty of muscle in the arm. Below the knee a hound should be quite straight,
                    and the distance should be short between the knee and the foot, which must be
                    short and round like a cat’s foot. So, too, with the hind legs; speed and
                    strength alike call for great length from the hip to the hock, and as little as
                    possible from the hock to the foot; the haunches or gaskins should be wide and
                    well furnished with muscle. A flat-sided hound should be drafted at once, as he
                    is sure to be a bad winded one; so should one that stands over at the knee when
                    looked at sideways. How to combine all the good points in one hound requires no
                    little judgment, but appearance is not all that must be thought of; the breeder
                    must have an eye to nose, pace, stoutness, and the avoidance of certain faults
                    in the field. In order to produce a goodlooking puppy, dams and sires, perfect
                    enough as regards make and shape, are often selected before they have taken the
                    field long enough to have their good or bad points developed. Three years is
                    quite early enough to begin to breed from any hound, male or female, and by that
                    time it will be pretty well known what are the hunting capabilities of each. Out
                    of every litter of whelps it may be necessary to destroy some,—four or five are
                    quite enough for a mother to rear,—but a diversity of opinion exists amongst
                    huntsmen as to which should be kept. As the points of a very young puppy cannot
                    be seen, the selection is really one of colour; some men prefer light colours,
                    others dark; the majority are in favour of the latter, light-coloured hounds and
                    horses being popularly supposed to have weak constitutions and uncertain
                    tempers.</p>
                <p>When the puppies are three or four days old the dewclaws should be severed with a
                    small and sharp pair of scissors, and after another day or two it is usual to
                    cut off about an inch of the tail. Rounding is the last operation that foxhounds
                    are subjected to, and generally takes place as soon as the puppy has quite
                    recovered from the distemper; it consists in cutting off the ends of the ears so
                    that they may not be torn in going through cover. When about ten or twelve weeks
                    old puppies are sent out to walk, and are not again received at the kennel till
                    the beginning of the following April, soon after which date the distemper may be
                    looked for. At this crisis the great aim should be to keep the body in a healthy
                    condition, and not to feed hounds too highly, whey and porridge only being
                    given. After the return from walks, the huntsman and whips should give the young
                    entry plenty of gentle exercise, at first in the couples; and nothing more need
                    be done in the way of training until about eight or nine weeks before cubbing
                    begins, when the young hounds, who should hitherto have been exercised by
                    themselves, should be put into the company of some older ones, and the exercise
                    should be gradually extended until they can keep up for 2 or 3 miles with a
                    horse going at half speed. The first day or two of cub-hunting is certain to be
                    a somewhat unsatisfactory performance; the young entry are sure to run riot; it
                    cannot be helped at first, but they will soon learn better manners under the
                    watchful eyes of the huntsman and whips, and in company of the old hounds, about
                    a dozen of the latter being taken out w ith twice that number of young ones. The
                    sooner the puppies taste blood the better; it will help to teach them to stick
                    to their proper game. Huntsmen therefore make every effort to bring a brace of
                    cubs to hand the first day they go out, but this thirst after blood should not
                    be indulged to any great extent afterwards, or the stock of foxes in the country
                    may be much impaired, and sport thereby diminished. There is perhaps nothing
                    connected with hunting of more importance, and, it may be added, of greater
                    interest, than good kennel management. First of all it is shown in the formation
                    of a level pack; for where things are done properly it is not enough to get
                    together a lot of hounds that are good in themselves, they must also be, as
                    nearly as possible, of one size. Then again, they must all be equally fast—to
                    use a common expression, a sheet should cover them when running. Lastly, they
                    must be free from certain faults, such as muteness, babbling, and skirting. A
                    mute hound is a terrible nuisance. A fox is found and goes away unperceived;
                    some time afterwards news is brought to the huntsman that a single hound has
                    been seen running hard a mile from cover. This is our mute friend, which got on
                    to the line by himself and gave no notice to anybody. But a young hound that is
                    reticent with his tongue should not be too hastily set down as mute; he may have
                    been flogged for proclaiming a scent, under the mistaken idea that he was
                    running riot, and if so it would have the effect of checking his music.
                    “Babbling” consists in a hound being too free with his tongue: after a fox hi.s
                    been found, the babbler announces the fact for the next ten minutes, and repeats
                    his refrain whenever the least opportunity presents itself. A hound may give
                    tongue too much without being an absolute babbler, but a noisy hound is pretty
                    sure to become a babbler, and when he is so he should be drafted at once. A
                    “skirter” is a hound that will not run with the pack, but is always taking a
                    line of his own; like the babbler he should have every chance, but, if gentle as
                    well as severe measures fail in effecting a reclamation, he too must be sent
                    away. It goes without saying that where good kennel management exists, the
                    hounds will be well <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0327-0316"/> disciplined, both in and out of the kennel. To
                    the uninitiated, a visit to the kennel at feeding time is an interesting sight,
                    notwithstanding the somewhat pungent smell of pudding and boiled horse. The
                    hounds, as hungry as the proverbial hunter, stand anxiously awaiting the order
                    to fall to, yet not daring to move until the order is given; and when the
                    huntsman thinks a hound has eaten sufficient, the mere calling out of his name
                    is sufficient to make him return to the benches, in spite of a desire for a more
                    prolonged stay at the trough. An extraordinary instance of discipline in the
                    field is related by Colonel Cook in his work <hi rend="italic">Observations on
                    Fox-hunting,</hi> p. 202. With hounds as with horses, control over them will be
                    best obtained by kindness: the popular idea is that huntsmen, whips, and feeders
                    never set about their respective duties unless armed with a formidable whip to
                    be used on all possible occasions; but happily this is an entire mistake.</p>
                <p>The feeding of a pack of hounds is a matter calling for the exercise of great
                    care and judgment, and cannot be properly carried out unless the establishment
                    enjoy the services of a thoroughly trustworthy feeder. His duty is to cook the
                    food, and to keep the utensils clean and the kennel sweet and wholesome. Hounds’
                    food comprises both animal and vegetable substances. Objections have sometimes
                    been made to admitting the former into the kennel fare at all, on the ground
                    that it is likely to impair the powers of scent, but the exception does not seem
                    to be well-founded, because wild dogs, as also wolves and foxes, are carnivorous
                    animals and live by the use of their scenting powers; in moderation flesh is a
                    necessity. Wheatmeal and barleymeal are eschewed, coarse oatmeal a twelvemonth
                    old being the only thing fit to feed hounds with. The meal is boiled in a large
                    iron boiler (a smaller one of the same metal being reserved for boiling the
                    flesh), and during the cooking the feeder must be on the watch lest any of it
                    stick to the bottom of the boiler. When sufficiently cooked it is turned out
                    into coolers. On meat being given it is cut into small pieces and stirred into
                    the pudding. In the summer young cabbages, given once every four days, form a
                    wholesome food, and are vastly superior to potatoes, swedes, or any other root.
                    With proper diet, an occasional alterative, and plenty of exercise, hounds
                    should seldom or never require to be plastered over with ointment in consequence
                    of skin irritations. The benches should be littered with good dry wheat-straw,
                    which should be taken out of the kennel and shaken up every morning when the
                    hounds are at exercise. Great cleanliness is indispensable; the natural odour of
                    a kennel is none of the sweetest, and if hounds are kept in the midst of dirt
                    their powers of scent will speedily deteriorate.</p>
                <p>The harrier like the foxhound is a very different animal from what he was one
                    hundred years ago. Then there were several sorts used in hare-hunting; first
                    came the old southern hound, used principally in heavy countries; the second
                    variety was a somewhat faster dog, with a sharp nose and pointed ears, and was
                    best adapted for an open country; thirdly, a rougher-coated hound; and lastly,
                    the old fashioned blue mottled harrier, found in the Weald of Sussex and some
                    parts of Kent. The first and last of the above list are said to have been
                    endowed with wonderful scenting powers, and we are told that when these hounds
                    were in use a run of six hours after a hare was no uncommon occurrence; but they
                    were so slow that the same authority tells us that they fatigued “the healthy
                    foot-man very little.” It is probable that the Sussex blue mottled hound was the
                    result of the first attempt to improve the old southern hound, and to obtain a
                    species particularly suitable for hare-hunting, but since then almost all the
                    traces of the old harrier have disappeared, until at the present time the modern
                    harrier is little more than a dwarf foxhound. When pursued by the old-fashioned
                    harrier, the hare had time to indulge in all those wiles in which our
                    forefathers delighted, and of which they wrote at length in the hunting
                    treatises of their time; but with the taste of the day in favour of pace, and
                    with the modern harrier, the “curious and lasting sport” of old has been put an
                    end to, and now the hare must, if the scent be moderately good, simply get away
                    as far and as fast as possible. The late Sir John Dashwood King, of West Wycombe
                    Park, Bucks, is said to have been the breeder to whom the sportsman is indebted
                    for the present race of harriers. His pack did not exceed 18 inches in height.
                    The parent stock was a small foxhound from the duke of Grafton’s kennel, named
                    Tyrant, whose blood, form, and character were apparent throughout; and so highly
                    was the pack thought of that Lord Sondes, of Rockingham Castle, gave 700 guineas
                    for it.</p>
                <p>The beagle (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dog)</hi> is used in hunting the hare, but
                    from its diminutive size it is not possessed of great pace; it is therefore
                    generally followed on foot, but it is a good plan to have one person on
                    horseback, in order that the pack may be stopped if they get away from the field
                    and make for a cover.</p>
                <p>The real otter hound bears a strong resemblance to the old southern hound. The
                    head is heavier than that of the foxhound, and the eyes are deeply set as in a
                    blood hound. The coat is rough and somewhat wiry, but it should be thick. The
                    otter hound is not very common, foxhounds being often used for otter hunting;
                    but the Carlisle pack is of the true breed.</p>
                <p>The remarks already made on kennel management apply, for the most part, in the
                    cases of hounds other than foxhounds; all varieties need the same cleanliness
                    and attention. The different game for which the hounds are entered of course
                    necessitate some trivial adaptation from the course pursued in foxhound kennels,
                    but speaking generally the management is the same. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. d.
