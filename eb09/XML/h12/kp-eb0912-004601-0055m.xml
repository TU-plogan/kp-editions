                    (1660-1742), the most famous physician in a family that had been connected with
                    medicine for 200 years before him, was born at Halle, February 19, 1660. He
                    received his school educational the gymnasium of his native town, where he
                    acquired that taste for and skill in mathematics to which he attributed much of
                    his after success. At the age of eighteen he went to study medicine at Jena,
                    whence in 1680 he passed to Erfurt, in order to attend Kasper Cramer’s lectures
                    on chemistry. Next year, returning to Jena, he received his doctor’s diploma,
                    and, after publishing a thesis, was permitted to teach. Constant study then
                    began to tell on his health, and in 1682, leaving his already numerous pupils,
                    he proceeded to Minden in Westphalia to recruit himself, at the request of a
                    relative who held a high position in that town. After practising his profession
                    at Minden for two years, Hoffmann made a journey to Holland and England, where
                    he formed the acquaintance of many illustrious chemists and physicians. Towards
                    the end of 1684 he returned to Minden, and during the next three years he
                    received many flattering appointments. In 1688 he removed to the more promising
                    sphere of Halberstadt, with the title of physician to the principality of
                    Halberstadt; and on the founding of Halle university in 1693, his reputation,
                    which had been steadily increasing, procured for him the primarius chair of
                    medicine, while at the same time he was charged with the responsible duty of
                    framing the statutes for the new medical faculty. He filled also the chair of
                    natural philosophy. With the exception of four years (1708-12), which he passed
                    at Berlin in the capacity of royal physician, without however giving up his
                    professorship, Hoffmann spent the rest of his life at Halle in instruction,
                    practice, and study, interrupted now and again by visits to different courts of
                    Germany, where his services procured him honours and rewards. His fame became
                    European. He was enrolled a member of many learned societies in different
                    foreign countries, while in his own he became privy councillor. He died at
                    Halle, on November 12, 1742.</p>
                <p>Hoffmann’s writings, the result both of compilation and original research, have
                    still a considerable suggestive value. His theories, though sometimes vague and
                    even idle, contributed in some degree to introduce a revolution in medical
                    science; while his doctrine of atony and spasm in the living solid as the sole
                    cause of internal disorders turned the attention of physicians more directly to
                    the primary moving powers of the system. He pursued with ardour the study of
                    practical chemistry, and pharmacy owes to him several preparations which are
                    still in general use. It was through Hoffmann also that many of the mineral
                    springs of Germany first came into repute as health resorts.</p>

                    undertaken at the age of sixty, and published in 1730. It was translated into

                    added in 1753 and 1760. Editions appeared also at Venice in 1745, and at Naples
                    in 1753 and 1793.</p>
