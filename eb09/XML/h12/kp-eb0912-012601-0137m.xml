                    a similarity of feeling or condition) as a distinctive system of medicine owes
                    its origin to Hahnemann, a German physician (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hahnemann).</hi> It is customary to regard homoeopathy as a mere system of
                    .therapeutics, having reference only to the question how and on what principle
                    is disease to be treated. But a careful student of Hahnemann or of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Organon</hi> will soon discover that the system with which his
                    name is fundamentally associated is one not merely of therapeutics but of
                    pathology, and that any complete exposition of it must embrace an account of
                    Hahnemann’s views of the ultimate nature and cause of disease, as well as of the
                    remedies by which it is to be combated, and the principles or principle on which
                    these are to be selected.</p>
                <p>Hahnemann taught that disease is to be regarded as consisting essentially of the
                    symptoms of it as experienced and expressed by the patient, or as detected by
                    the physician; in other words, that the chief symptoms, or the “totality of the
                    symptoms,” constitute the disease, and that disease is in no case caused by any
                    material substance, but is only and always a peculiar, virtual, dynamic
                    derangement of the health. “Diseases” (Introduction to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organon,</hi> p. 17) “will not cease to be spiritual dynamic derangements of
                    our spiritual vital principle.” He says on page 3 of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organon, “</hi> For as far the greatest number of diseases are of dynamic
                    (spiritual) origin and dynamic (spiritual) nature, their cause is therefore not
                    perceptible to the senses;” and at page 18, referring “to small-pox, a disease
                    accompanied by almost general suppuration,” he asks, “is it possible to
                    entertain the idea of a material morbific matter being introduced into the
                    blood?” He held that the psoric miasm, of which the itch is the outward and
                    visible and comparatively harmless sign, was at the root of nearly all chronic
                    disease, viz., of all chronic disease that was not due to syphilis or sycosis.
                    He tells us in a note to the 80th section of the <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi>
                    that he spent twelve years in the investigations which led to the discovery of
                    that great source of chronic disease and of its remedies (antipsoric remedies).
                    It was a very essential part of Hahnemann’s teaching that nature is a bad
                    physician, and not to be much trusted; that drugs are the real curative agents
                    provided by the beneficence of the Almighty; that drugs given to healthy persons
                    have a power of producing symptoms of disease. The ascertainment of the symptoms
                    produced by drugs in healthy persons is called technically “proving,” and the
                    record of such provings constitutes a large part of the literature of
                    homoeopathy. This power of drugs he perpetually refers to as their “pathogenetic
                    power.” His great therapeutical doctrine, for formulating which his followers
                    call him, with doubtful taste, “the Messiah of Medicine,” was to this effect,
                    that there is a correspondence between the symptoms produced by any given drug
                    administered to a healthy person and its power of curing any given disease, and
                    that the remedy for any given disease, that is, for any set of symptoms “in
                    their totality,” is that drug which, given to any healthy person, will produce
                    the most perfect imitation of the said set of symptoms; in other words, <hi
                    rend="italic">Similia similibus curantur.</hi> Further, the dose of medicine is
                    to be so attenuated as to cure the disease without hurting the patient. This
                    attenuation of medicines constitutes, not only the most popular note of the
                    system of Hahnemann, but that feature of it which is most characteristic of his
                    own views and practice, and which in well-known words he declared to be
                    established beyond the reach of cavil from future experience either of allopaths
                    or of practitioners of the “new mongrel system made up of a mixture of
                    allopathic and homoeopathic processes.” He gives minute directions as to the
                    processes by which this attenuation is to be achieved, the principal of which
                    are trituration, succussion, and dilution. These processes developed what he
                    called the “spiritual power which lies hid in the inner nature of medicines”
                    (20th section of the <hi rend="italic">Organon).</hi> Hahnemann held that
                    medicines became, for curative purposes, more powerful as they became more
                    attenuated; in his last edition of the <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> (1833),
                    and in its last pages, he gave the most expressive evidence of his belief in the
                    virtue of attenuation by saying that he could scarcely name one disease which in
                    the last year he and his assistants had not treated with the most happy results,
                    solely by means of “olfaction”; and he added that a patient even destitute of
                    the sense of smell may expect an equally perfect action and cure from the
                    medicine by olfaction. He condemned strongly the administration simultaneously
                    of a number of medicines, and insisted that only one should be given at a time.
                    Finally, it would be unjust to him not to bear in mind that he claimed to base
                    his views and practice on experience and sound experiment. Some points of his
                    system were borrowed by Hahnemann from previous writers—as, indeed, he himself,
                    though imperfectly, admits. Not to mention others, he was anticipated by
                    Hippocrates, and especially by Paracelsus (1495-1541), in his doctrine of <hi
                    rend="italic">Similia similibus curantur,</hi> if not in its exclusive
                    application. These identical words occur in the Geneva edition (1658) of the
                    works of Paracelsus, as a marginal heading to une of the paragraphs; and in the
                    “Fragmenta Medica,” <hi rend="italic">Op. Omnia,</hi> vol. i. 168, 169, occurs
                    the following passage:—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Simile</hi><hi rend="italic">similis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cura; non</hi><hi rend="italic">contrarium.</hi></p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Quisquis enim cum laude agere Medicum volet, is has nugas longe valere
                    jubeat. Nec enim ullus uuquam morbus calidus per frigida sanatus fuit, nec
                    frigidus per calida. Simile autem suum timile frequenter curavit, scilicet
                    Mercurius sulphur, et sulphur Mercurium; et sal illa, velut et illa sal.
                    Interdum quidem eum proprietate junctum frigidum sanavit calidum; sed id non
                    factum est ratione frigidi, verum ratione naturae alterius, quam a primo illo
                    omnino diversam facimus.”</p>
                <p>It is very remarkable that in Hahnemann’s enumeration <hi rend="italic">bi</hi>
                    authors who anticipated him in regard to the doctrine of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Similia,</hi> he makes no mention of the views of Paracelsus, though the very
                    words seem to be taken from the works of that physician. The other point in
                    Hahnemann’s doctrine—that medicines should be tried first on healthy persons—he
                    admits to have been enunciated by Haller. Roughly it has been acted on by
                    physicians in all ages, but certainly more systematically since Hahnemann’s
                    time, though the result is often not such as to support his theory in regard to
                    the action of medicine on the diseased as compared with the healthy body.</p>
                <p>In the most characteristic feature of Hahnemann’s practice—“the potentizing,”
                    “dynamizing,” of medicinal substances—he appears to have been original. It has
                    been generally affirmed that he was led to adopt his doctrine of “attenuation”
                    by the fact that the medicines he administered produced similar effects to those
                    uf the disease, and that in any gross quantity, as he admitted, they would
                    aggravate matters. But another and a chief reason is to be found in his views of
                    the “spiritual,” “immaterial,” “dynamic” origin of disease, and his resentment
                    against the old modes of practice of medicine.</p>
                <p>The followers of Hahnemann are true to him in making light comparatively of
                    pathological facts, and giving their main attention to therapeutics. They are
                    still concerned mainly with medicines, and one very large American encyclopaedia
                    is devoted exclusively to a record of ‘ ‘ Provings”; it is edited by Dr Timothy
                    Allen, professor of materia medica and therapeutics in the New York Homoeopathic
                    Medical College. For some years Hahnemann’s disciples continued pretty faithful
                    to the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Similia similibus curantur,</hi> but they
                    were not long in making some changes in it. We can only notice a few of the
                    leading deviations. Dr Sharp, of Rugby, who has striven hard to overcome
                    objectors, while admitting the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Similia,</hi>
                    requires that it have regard, not to mere symptoms, but to the seat and
                    pathology of the case; that the drug used be one which shall affect the organ at
                    fault. Homoeopathy cannot become a science till it is founded on what he calls
                    Organopathy, or a much more careful consideration of the seat of disease than is
                    involved in Hahnemann’s views, who, he complains, passionately rejected
                    pathology and morbid anatomy. Recently a leading homoeopathist has published a
                    book, the very title of which contradicts the doctrine of his master. Hahnemann
                    maintains that cures never were effected in any other manner than by means of
                    medicines of homoeopathic power <hi rend="italic">(Organon,</hi> p. 100), and
                    that, whenever cures were wrought by those who did not understand homoeopathy,
                    it was in virtue of the homoeopathic law, “the only law consonant to nature.”
                    But in 1878 Dr Kidd, the leading consultant among homoeopathic practitioners in
                    London, published a book on the <hi rend="italic">Laιvs of Therapeutics.</hi> It
                    is true that he does not carry the pluralizing far: he only substitutes two for
                    Hahnemann’s one law; but it is not the less a very remarkable departure. He is
                    still faithful to the idea of a relationship between the action of medicines on
                    the healthy and their curative value in sickness; but the law of <hi
                    rend="italic">Similia</hi> is sadly compromised. “In most cases that
                    relationship is either of <hi rend="italic">similarity</hi> or of <hi
                    rend="italic">contrariety.”</hi> “Looking,” says he, “to the observation of
                    facts apart from theoretic speculations, two primary laws of therapeutics unfold
                    themselves. Those two laws of therapeutics may well be called Galen’s law,
                    founded upon the rule of <hi rend="italic">contraria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >contrariis,</hi> and Hahnemann’s or the homoeopathic law, founded upon the
                    relationship of similars.” This is certainly a comprehensive if a rather
                    unphilosophical generalization. The practice of Hahnemann as to the use of
                    highly attenuated doses of medicine is evidently not more closely adhered to
                    than his doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Similia.</hi> This fact is the subject of
                    complaint in homoeopathic journals. The <hi rend="italic">Medical
                    Investigator,</hi> in 1876, says reprovingly: “How many claiming to be
                    homoeopaths are daily entirely disregarding the law of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Similia.</hi> It is getting to be quite a rare thing to hear of a homoeopathic
                    practitioner conducting a serious case from beginning to end without using as
                    such cathartics, sudorifics, diuretics, &amp;c., in direct opposition to our
                    law; not only are these drugs used in this way, but there are some also go so
                    far as to say that they cannot be dispensed with.” Dr Wyld, the vice-president
                    of the British Homoeopathic Society, in a letter to Dr W. B. Richardson,
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi> of June 2, 1877, arguing for an
                    abolition of the schism of the profession on this question, thus sums up the
                    admissions which he as a somewhat representative man was prepared to make:—“<hi
                    rend="italic">First,</hi> that the views expressed by Hahnemann are often
                    extravagant and incorrect; <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> that Hippocrates was
                    right when he said some diseases are best treated by similars and some by
                    contraries, and therefore it is unwise and incorrect to assume the title of
                    homoeopathist; <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> that although many believe that
                    the action of the infinitesimal in nature can be demonstrated, its use in
                    medicine is practically by a large number in this country all but abandoned.” It
                    must not, however, be supposed that there are not many true believers in
                    Hahnemann’s doctrines both of <hi rend="italic">Similia,</hi> &lt;fcc., and of
                    infinitesimal doses, extending even to olfactions. In fact, one recent writer
                    goes beyond Hahnemann. In the <hi rend="italic">Homoeopathic Observer,</hi>
                    after many years of anxious experimenting, he claims to have discovered decided
                    results from olfaction, or the smelling of medicines, but more especially by
                    means of medicines contained in <hi rend="italic">closed</hi> vessels held in
                    the hand. Mons. Granier, of Nîmes, carries the dynamic theory of Hahnemann
                    farther than its author. “Medicines,” he says, “are fluidic powers, they are
                    beings <hi rend="italic">(etres}</hi> that man may create at his will. I wish I
                    could say they are occult powers, forming the chain of fluidic connection
                    between the world and the tomb; but I am convinced in my own mind that, placed
                    on the limits of <hi rend="italic">fluidic dynamism,</hi> our observation might
                    cast its scrutinizing glance into the unseen world.”</p>
                <p>Homoeopathy has a considerable number of adherents in Great Britain, in the
                    United States, and on the continent of Europe. In order to ascertain the esteem
                    accorded to it in the land of its origin, inquiries have been made of neutral
                    and unbiassed authorities, and the general result is that it has no scientific
                    recognition, but that many of the public believe in it, and consult
                    practitioners who profess to practise it. The system has no place iu any of the
                    universities of Germany, nor does it seem to have a single school of its own in
                    the entire German empire. It is universally condemned in Germany by men who have
                    anything to do with biological science, and even in the lectures on therapeutics
                    it is not mentioned at all. In Great Britain the Medical Act of 1858 gives power
                    to the Privy Council severely to prohibit attempts by any examining body to
                    impose restrictions as to any theory of medicine or surgery on candidates for
                    examination. There is a homoeopathic hospital with 100 beds in London, to which
                    is attached a homoeopathic school (see Dr Wyld in <hi rend="italic">Lancet,</hi>
                    June 2, 1877). Homoeopathy is not strong in England. There are said to be 105
                    homoeopathic practitioners in London. In Great Britain and Ireland, with a
                    population <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0139-0128"/> of thirty-five millions, there are but 275
                    homoeopathic physicians. Liverpool and Glasgow, each with about half a million
                    of population, have respectively fifteen and five homoeopathic doctors. The
                    somewhat weak and failing condition of homoeopathy in Britain is thus contrasted
                    by a writer in the monthly <hi rend="italic">Homoeopathic Review</hi> for
                    January 1880 with its condition in America: in four chief American cities there
                    are 462 homoeopathic doctors, in four English towns 139; in New York city the
                    homoeopathic physicians are to the allopathic as 1 to 6, in London the
                    proportion is 1 to 20. The writer attributes the lower condition of homoeopathy
                    in England to the fact “that it has ceased to be a novelty, that it has
                    revolutionized orthodox medicine, and that many of our own men (homoeopathic
                    practitioners) abjure the minute doses which served so well in the hands of
                    Hahnemann and many of his earlier disciples.” But all these facts or factors
                    must obtain equally in America. It is probable that the different system of
                    medical education and qualification in the two countries has something to do
                    with the difference. In the United States homoeopathy has naturally had freer
                    scope than in Europe. Some have estimated the proportion of homoeopathic
                    practitioners in the States as being one-eighth of the whole number of legally
                    qualified practitioners. Every State determines for itself the conditions of
                    qualification in medicine; and there is thus a vast number of separate medical
                    schools giving both education and diplomas. Consequently there is a serious
                    inequality in the severity of medical education and examination. In some States,
                    as in that of Michigan, the legislature has engrafted on the university a
                    department for teaching its youth the principles and therapeutics of
                    homoeopathy; and very lately the same legislature has provided a hospital for
                    the homoeopathic treatment of disease.</p>
                <p>In all countries the doctrine of homoeopathy is still without broad scientific
                    recognition; and certainly in England its chief representatives are anxious to
                    cease their existence as a distinctive school, and have, by their avowed
                    departure from Hahnemann’s law of <hi rend="italic">Similia,</hi> and his mode
                    of attenuating and administering medicines, brought themselves under the
                    severest condemnation of their master’s few faithful followers, amongst whom are
                    still included men of high character. We need not discuss in detail the
                    individual doctrines of Hahnemann, especially those just referred to, as they
                    are scarcely fought for by those who now represent what remains of the
                    homoeopathic school. Hahnemann’s fundamental views of disease deserve more
                    attention. He despised any deep study of disease, and theorized about it
                    instead. Had he carefully inquired into the nature and natural history of
                    disease as Hippocrates did, or as he himself inquired into the sensations of
                    those who took infinitesimal doses, he would have done more for the world and
                    his own reputation. Hahnemann was easily captivated by theories, and not very
                    sound in his reasoning. But underlying all his system, as we have seen, was the
                    idea that the causes of disease were impalpable, immaterial, spiritual, dynamic.
                    And this great foundation was rotten. Modern medicine is doing some of its best
                    work in showing the material and the visible character of the causes of many of
                    the commonest diseases, and suggests this in many cases where it has not as yet
                    been demonstrated. The cause of many diseases is shown to be a living germ or
                    particle which can be discerned under the microscope, can be carried on a lancet
                    or in a tube, and inserted under the skin so as to produce its peculiar disease.
                    This is true of small pox, Hahnemann notwithstanding. The germ can be preserved
                    or it can be killed, and thus disease can be propagated or prevented. The close
                    air of workshops, which generates consumption in such amount, can be shown to be
                    full of impurities, chemical or organic. The causes of other diseases are often,
                    not merely visible under a microscope, but coarsely visible. We have been lately
                    told on high authority that to produce certain forms of blood-poisoning one or
                    two ounces at least of septic fluid are necessary. So with other forms of common
                    disease. Alcohol does not destroy a liver or kidney in any dynamic or immaterial
                    form, but in coarse quantities diligently repeated. The lead which paralyses the
                    painter’s wrist is not a “spiritual” thing. It is an accumulation of matter in
                    the wrong place, and enters his body in palpable quantities, and, what is more,
                    can be recovered in similar quantities from his body. So with the uric acid or
                    its salts in the blood of a person who has inherited his father’s gout, and
                    perhaps his port wine. It is not a “spiritual” affair at all, but can be
                    demonstrated chemically and under the microscope. The itch, to whose mysterious
                    workings Hahnemann attributed two-thirds of the internal diseases of the body,
                    including mania, cancer, gout, &amp;c., is easily demonstrated to be dependent
                    on an ugly crab-like insect, which can be destroyed in a few hours with sulphur,
                    when there is an end both of it and of the itch. We are aware of the euphemistic
                    form which is given to Hahnemann’s views of the psoric or itch disease; and we
                    are partly disposed to admit, with the late Professor Henderson, the ablest and
                    wisest of Hahnemann’s supporters in England, that Hahnemann was unfortunate in
                    the exposition of his own view s of this subject. But Hahnemann’s fine but
                    fundamental theories about the spiritual and dynamic origin of disease are all
                    exploded by the revelations of modern pathology, and their demolition only
                    completes that of his therapeutical theories which rested on them.</p>
                <p>Still it does not follow that homoeopathy has been of no use. Hahnemann deserves
                    the credit of being the first to break decidedly with the old school of medical
                    practice, in which, forgetful of the teachings of Hippocrates, nature was either
                    overlooked or rudely opposed by wrong and ungentle methods. He was so
                    dissatisfied with this system that he gave up practice. We can scarcely now
                    estimate the force of character and of courage which was implied, eighty years
                    back, in abandoning the common lines of medicine. More than this, he and his
                    followers showed results in the treatment of disease which compared very
                    favourably with the results of orthodox practice. But they entirely missed the
                    right conclusion from their experience. Let us take, for example, the statistics
                    of the treatment of inflammation of the lung (pneumonia), adduced, not by
                    Hahnemann,—-for it is one of his very weak points that he did not record cases,
                    —but, after his death, by Dr Fleischmann of Vienna. Dr Henderson quotes these
                    and other homoeopathic statistics with great satisfaction, and undoubtedly and
                    properly they produced a great effect, showing a mortality of 1 in 21 cases
                    only, which was a much higher percentage of success than under the ordinary
                    treatment. But these statistics have since been entirely eclipsed by the minute
                    and historical record of cases treated in the Edinburgh Infirmary, where the
                    late Dr Hughes Bennett treated 105 cases of acute pneumonia, extending over
                    sixteen years, without one death. Still we must admit that Fleischmann’s results
                    were greatly better than the old ones, and that but for the homoeopathic
                    practice, which most practitioners regarded as a negation, tantamount to leaving
                    the disease to nature, the emancipation from traditional methods of treatment
                    would have been much slower than it was.</p>
                <p>Besides this, homoeopathy may be credited with two other services. It has given
                    prominence to the therapeutical side of medicine, and has done much to stimulate
                    the study of the physiological action of drugs. No doubt Hahnemann completely
                    erred in despising nature, and in magnifying medicines in the cure of disease.
                    But his very methods showed, unintentionally on his part, what nature could do;
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n140/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0140-0129"/> and his devotion and that of his school to
                    therapeutics has acted as a somewhat deserved rebuke to those physicians who get
                    so absorbed in the study of disease as to forget that the great interest of
                    mankind in it is to have it cured with as little delay as possible. It may be
                    admitted that homoeopathy has done some service in directing more special
                    attention to various powerful drugs, such as aconite, nux vomica, belladonna,
                    and to the advantage of giving them in simpler forms than were common before the
                    days of Hahnemann.</p>
                <p>Hahnemann’s errors were great. His doctrine of specifics was highly retrograde
                    and unscientific, and his disparagement of the principle of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tolle causam</hi> and of those who aimed at discovering the causes of disease
                    <hi rend="italic">(Organon,</hi> p. 3) was unphilosophical. He was fanciful and
                    theoretical to a very high degree. He led his followers far out of the track of
                    sound views of disease and the methods by which it can best be prevented and
                    cured. But, with all his defects, it must be admitted that he had the great
                    merit of disturbing and discrediting indefensible modes of practice. (j. G.
