                    linguistic studies, and received his first lessons in some of the Eastern
                    tongues, from his father, who was rector of the parish. In <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0442-0427"/> his sixteenth year Hyde entered King’s College,
                    Cambridge, where, under Wheelock, professor of Arabic, he made such rapid
                    progress in the Oriental languages that, after only one year of residence, he
                    was invited to London to assist Brian Walton in his edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyglot Bible.</hi> Besides correcting the Arabic, Persic, and
                    Syriac texts for that work, Hyde transcribed into Persic characters the Persian
                    translation of the Pentateuch, which had been printed in Hebrew letters at
                    Constantinople in 1546. To this work, which Archbishop Ussher had thought
                    well-nigh impossible even for a native of Persia, Hyde appended the Latin
                    version which accompanies it in the <hi rend="italic">Polyglot.</hi> Having
                    successfully accomplished these difficult tasks amidst the flattering
                    acknowledgments of the most learned men of the day, Hyde entered Queen’s
                    College, Oxford, in 1658, where he was chosen Hebrew reader; and in 1659, in
                    consideration of his singular erudition in Oriental tongues, he was admitted to
                    the degree of M.A. In the same year he was appointed under-keeper of the
                    Bodleian library, and in 1665 he became librarian-in-chief. Next year he was
                    collated to a prebend at Salisbury, and in 1673 to the archdeaconry of
                    Gloucester, receiving the degree of D.D. shortly afterwards. In 1691 the death
                    of Pocock opened up to Hyde the Laudian professorship of Arabic; and in 1697, on
                    the deprivation of Altham, he succeeded to the regius chair of Hebrew and a
                    canonry of Christ Church. Under Charles II., James II., and William III., Hyde
                    discharged the duties of Eastern interpreter to the court. Worn out by his
                    unremitting labours, he resigned his librarianship in 1701, and died at Oxford,
                    February 18, 1703. Hyde was an excellent classical scholar, and there was hardly
                    an Eastern tongue accessible to foreigners with which his wide erudition had not
                    made him familiar. He had even acquired Chinese, while his writings are the best
                    testimony to his mastery of Turkish, Arabic, Syriac, Persic, Hebrew, and Malay.
                    His books are still valuable; and, although later investigations and additional
                    authorities have partially superseded and corrected his conclusions, he still
                    deserves respect as one of the first scholars to direct attention to the vast
                    treasures of Oriental antiquity.</p>

                    1700, Hyde made the first attempt to correct from Oriental sources the errors of
                    the Greek and Roman historians who had described the religion of the ancient
                    Persians, but through ignorance of the ancient language of Persia he has been
                    often misled by Mahometan authorities. His other writings and translations
