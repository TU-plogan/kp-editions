                    honour of Lord Hobart, then secretary of state for the colonies), is situated in
                    the south of the island in 42° 53' 22" S. lat. and 147° 2Γ 20" E. long. It
                    occupies a succession of hills along a sheltered bight on the western bank of
                    the Derwent river, known as Sullivan’s Cove, about 17 miles from the ocean, and

                    the Franklin Square, with the bronze statue of the eminent Arctic explorer, who

                    are conveniently adjacent to each other in Magdalen Street. The town-hall,
                    erected about 1872 at a cost of £12,000, contains a large reading-room and a
                    suite of rooms for the free public library, which has upwards of 8000 volumes.
                    The museum comprises a scientific library and apartments for the Royal Society
                    of Tasmania. Besides the Anglican cathedral of St David’s, founded in 1873, and
                    the Roman Catholic cathedral of St Mary’s, the churches comprise a
                    Congregational memorial church, a Wesleyan “Centenary” chapel, and others
                    belonging to Baptists, Independents, and Quakers. There is also a synagogue, but
                    the Jewish community consists of only a few families. The charitable
                    institutions of the town are maintained at the expense of the state. Among the
                    remaining buildings may be mentioned five banks, a theatre, the freemasons’ hall
                    and the oddfellows’ hall. In the neighbourhood of the city is the official
                    residence of the governor of Tasmania, an ornate castellated mansion; the
                    grounds of this adjoin the botanic gardens, which occupy an area of 21
                    acres.</p>
                <p>Hobart Town has been under municipal government since 1853, and was incorporated
                    as a city in 1857. There are nine aidermen elected by the ratepayers, and one of
                    them is appointed mayor. The annual value of rateable property exceeds £100,000.
                    An abundant supply of pure water is brought from the springs of Mount
                    Wellington, and stored in a reservoir about a mile from the city, capable of
                    holding 50,000,000 gallons. Among the industrial establishments are six
                    breweries, a candle factory, a foundry, ten hat and cap factories, seven steam
                    flour-mills, a pottery, twelve saw-mills, and a tin-smelting work. The commerce
                    of the town is steadily increasing. The securely sheltered harbour is capable of
                    accommodating ships of the largest tonnage, and is provided with three patent
                    slips of considerable size; not only is the port the headquarters of the
                    Tasmanian Steam Navigation Company, which trades with Melbourne, Sydney, and New
                    Zealand, but a line of colonial vessels communicates regularly with London.
                    During the year 1877 the total burthen of shipping inwards was 79,480 tons, of
                    the shipping outwards 82,827 tons. The declared value of the imports at the
                    Custom House was £664,439 (£255,344 from the United Kingdom), and that of the
                    exports £720,136 (£301,477 to the United Kingdom), £715,304 worth being produce
                    of the colony. The customs collected during the year 1878 amounted to £118,306,
                    being an increase of about £4000 on the previous year. According to the returns
                    for 1877 the principal exports were tin ore (value £61,765), tin (£20,886), bark
                    (2086 tons, £13,410), fruit (138,585 bushels, £44,001), jam (3,742,341 lb,
                    £100,069), hops (696,048 lb, £36,457), sperm-oil (450 tons, £33,410), rabbit
                    skins (58,781 dozen, £5072), timber, shingles, railings, &amp;c. (£351,851), and
                    wool (£299,514). The principal imports are sugar, tea, oil, tobacco, live stock,
                    machinery, spirits and wine, boots and shoes, wearing apparel, ironmongery and
                    cutlery, glass and china-ware, books and stationery, saddlery, manure, drugs,
                    &amp;c. The first newspaper was published in Hobart Town in 1810. There are now
                    (1880) two dailies, one weekly, and four monthlies. During the summer season the
                    city is a favourite resort of Australian tourists attracted by the comparative
                    coolness of the climate. The mean temperature for 35 years was 55’41° Fahr.; and
                    in the same period the barometer at a temperature of 32° has registered an
                    average of 29 ’ 82 inches.</p>
