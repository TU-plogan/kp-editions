                    in Germany) to the large bees of the genus <hi rend="italic">Bombus</hi> (which,
                    like the French “Bourdon,” is probably also suggested by the noise made by these
                    insects). They belong to the social section of the great family <hi
                    rend="italic">Apidoe,</hi> of which the common hive-bee is the type, and, like
                    that well-known insect, live in colonies composed of the two sexes and neuters.
                    Instead of a single female (or queen), however, many are found in one nest; and
                    the workers do not hibernate. The female also differs from the queen hive-bee in
                    having dense fringes of hairs on the pollen-plates of the hind legs, and a
                    widened base to the hind tarsi, a structure necessitated by her having to work
                    single-handed at the commencement of the season, as the workers and males do not
                    survive the winter. Early in the spring these large hibernated females may be
                    observed on the wing, each becoming the founder of a fresh colony, in which the
                    neuters are first produced. There are two kinds of females, the smaller one only
                    producing male eggs, but not surviving the winter. The number of individuals in
                    a colony varies with the different species, and as a rule is least in those
                    building their nest above ground. In one very common subterranean species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bombus terrestris,</hi> as many as 107 males, 56 females, and 180
                    workers have been found in one nest. There is considerable difference between
                    the males, females, and neuters; the last two differ, however, but little except
                    in size, whereas the males often exhibit a very varying coloration, and have
                    structural peculiarities, such as an additional segment to the abdomen, longer
                    antennae and tongue, no pollen-basket, &amp;c. They have also no sting, whereas
                    both female and worker are armed like the hive-bee. Great difficulty exists in
                    referring these three constituents to their proper species, owing to individual
                    variation, alteration with age, and the difficulty of seeing all the members of
                    a colony at the same time; so that naturalists are not by any means agreed as to
                    the specific <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n354/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0354-0343"/> βtatus of many of them, and the synonymy is very
                    complicated. The nests are not constructed after the symmetrical fashion of
                    those of the hive-bee, but consist of a collection of oval brownish cells, at
                    first few in number, but receiving additions and extensions as the brood
                    increases, and accompanied by cells containing pollen and honey. The workers
                    assist in rearing the larvae, and in disengaging the individuals from their
                    pupal integuments as they reach the perfect state; and it has been noticed that
                    this metamorphosis is accelerated by a kiud of incubation. The nests are made
                    under bushes, in banks, &amp;c., sometimes as much as 5 feet from the surface. A
                    well-known one is made by the “Moss-carder” humble-bee, <hi rend="italic">Bombus
                    muscorum,</hi> which has often been observed collecting the natural material for
                    its dome, working in line. As usual with provident or social animals, these
                    interesting insects are subject to encroachment by parasites of various kinds;
                    most noteworthy among which are some species (there are three or four in
                    England) of the closely allied genus <hi rend="italic">Ap&gt;athus (or
                    Psi-</hi><hi rend="italic">thyms),</hi> superficially resembling exactly the
                    true humble-bees, but with no pollen-collecting apparatus, and no workers. They
                    exist apparently on friendly terms with their hosts, whose stores are at times
                    materially preyed upon by the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Volucella,</hi> a
                    genus of <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> or twowinged flies also resembling
                    humble-bees. Various beetles, such as <hi rend="italic">Antherophagus,
                    Cryptophagus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Leptinus,</hi> &amp;c., and the larvae of
                    <hi rend="italic">Tinea ι&gt;ellionella,</hi> a small moth, also occur in their
                    nests.</p>
                <p>As regards distribution, the <hi rend="italic">Bombi</hi> are found in Europe,
                    America (North and South), Africa, India, China, and J ava, but not in
                    Australasia, where, indeed, it has even been attempted to introduce some species
                    for the purpose of fertilizing the introduced clover, for which the structure of
                    the native insects is apparently insufficient. It is, however, in the northern
                    zone that they flourish best, their hardy nature enabling them to exist in the
                    Arctic regions, as far as man has penetrated; and the numerous additions
                    continually being made to the list of known species from the Caucasus, the Amur
                    district, Türkistan, Arizona, &amp;c., point, not only to a wide geographical
                    range, but to a large adaptation to some useful end. The experiments of Darwin,
                    Müller, and others show how important a part is played by humble-bees in the
                    economy of nature as plant fertilizers; and, though perhaps not exhibiting such
                    highly-developed instincts as the hive-bee, they possess sufficient reasoning
                    power to enable them, by perforating the base of the calyx of certain flowers,
                    to obtain otherwise inaccessible honey.</p>
