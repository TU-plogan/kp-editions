                    other. From his earliest childhood he was trained in every polite
                    accomplishment, and before he was seven he could speak French with fluency. He
                    was taught Latin by Johannes Dedelus, and soon became a master of classic
                    versification. As he grew up, he developed not only extraordinary intellectual
                    gifts but great physical beauty and strength, and was one of the most
                    accomplished athletes and gymnasts οΐ his age; his skill in playing the lute and
                    in the arts of painting and engraving attracted general attention before he
                    began to develop his genius as a writer. In 1616 he proceeded, with his elder
                    brother, to the university of Leyden. He stayed there only one year, and in 1618
                    proceeded to London with the English ambassador Carleton; he remained in London
                    for some months, and then went to Oxford, where he studied for some time in the
                    Bodleian Library,and to Woodstock,Windsor, and Cambridge; he was introduced at
                    the English court, and played the lute before James I. The most interesting
                    feature of this visit was the intimacy which sprang up between the young Dutch
                    poet and the famous Dr Donne, for whose genius Huygens preserved through life an
                    unbounded admiration. He returned to Holland in company with the English
                    contingent of the synod of Dort, and in 1620 he proceeded to Venice in the
                    diplomatic service of his country; on his return he nearly lost his life by a
                    foolhardy exploit, namely, the scaling of the topmost spire of Strasburg
                    cathedral. In 1621 he published one of his most weighty and popular poems, his
                    <hi rend="italic">Batava</hi><hi rend="italic">Tempe,</hi> and in the same year
                    he proceeded again to London, as secretary to the ambassador, Wijngaerdan, but
                    returned in three months. His third diplomatic visit to England lasted longer,
                    from the 5th of December 1621 to the 1st of March 1623. During his absence, his
                    volume of satires, <hi rend="italic">Costelick Mai,</hi> dedicated to Jacob
                    Cats, appeared at the Hague. In the autumn of 1622 he was knighted by James I.
                    He published a large volume of miscellaneous poems in 1625 under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Otiorum libri</hi><hi rend="italic">sex</hi>; and in the same
                    year he was appointed private secretary to the stadholder. In 1627 Huygens
                    married Suzanna van Baerle, and the young couple settled in a handsome house in
                    the best part of the Hague; four sons and a daughter were born to them. In 1630
                    Huygens was called to a seat in the privy council, and he continued to exercise
                    political power with wisdom and vigour for many years, under the title of the
                    lord of Zuylichem. In 1634 he completed his long-talked-of version of the poems
                    of Donne. In 1637 he had the misfortune to lose his admirable wife, and he
                    immediately began to celebrate the virtues and pleasures of their married life
                    in the remarkable didactic poem called <hi rend="italic">Daywerck,</hi> which
                    was not published till long afterwards. From 1639 to 1641 he occupied himself by
                    building a magnificent house and garden outside the Hague, and by celebrating
                    their beauties in a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Hofwijck,</hi> which saw the
                    light in 1654. In 1647 he wrote his beautiful poem of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oogentroost</hi> or “Eye Consolation,” to gratify his blind friend Lucretia van
                    Trollo. He made his solitary effort in the dramatic line in 1659, when he
                    brought out his comedy of <hi rend="italic">Trijntje</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cornelis,</hi> which deals, in rather broad humour, with the adventures of the
                    wife of a ship’s captain at Zaandam. In 1658 he rearranged his poems, and issued
                    them with many additions, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Corn
                    Flowers.</hi> He proposed to the Government that the present highway from the
                    Hague to the sea at Scheveningen should be constructed, and during his absence
                    on a diplomatic mission to the French court in 1666 the road was made as a
                    compliment to the venerable statesman, who expressed his gratitude in a
                    descriptive poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Zeestraet.</hi> Huygens edited his
                    poems for the last time in 1672, and died in his ninety-first year, on the 28th
                    of March 1687. His second son, Christiaan, the eminent astronomer, is noticed
                    above.</p>
                <p>Constantijn Huygens is the most brilliant figure in Dutch literary history. Other
                    statesmen surpassed him in political influence, and at least two other poets
                    surpassed him in the value and originality of their writings. But his figure was
                    more dignified and splendid, his talents were more varied, and his general
                    accomplishments more remarkable than those of any other person of his age, the
                    greatest age in the history of the Netherlands. Huygens is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >grand seigneur</hi> of the republic, the type of aristocratic oligarchy, the
                    jewel and ornament of Dutch liberty. When we consider his imposing character and
                    the positive value of his writings, we may well be surprised that he has not
                    found a modern editor. It is a disgrace to Dutch scholarship that no complete
                    collection of the writings of Huygens exists. His autobiography, <hi
                    rend="italic">Be vita propria</hi><hi rend="italic">sermones,</hi> did not see
                    the light until 1827, and his remarkable poem, <hi rend="italic">Cluys∙
                    werck,</hi> was not printed until 1842. As a poet Huygens shows a finer sense of
                    form than any other Dutch writer; the language, in his hands, becomes as
                    flexible as Italian. His epistles and lighter pieces, in particular, display his
                    metrical ease and facility to perfection. (E. W. G.)</p>
