                    celebrated Richard Hooker, devoted much of his time to the study of German
                    literature and the cultivation of curious plants. The son was educated at the
                    high school of Norwich, on leaving which his independent means enabled him to
                    travel and to take up as a recreation the study of natural history, especially
                    ornithology and entomology. He subsequently confined his attention to botany, on
                    the recommendation of Sir James E. Smith, whom he had consulted respecting a
                    rare moss picked up in a ramble. His first botanical expedition was made in
                    Iceland, in the summer of 1809, at the suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks; but the
                    natural history specimens which he collected, with his notes and drawings, were
                    lost on the homeward voyage through the burning of the ship, and the young
                    botanist himself had a narrow escape with his life. A good memory, however,
                    aided him to publish an account of the island, and of its inhabitants and flora
                    <hi rend="italic">(Tour in Iceland,</hi> 1809), privately circulated in 1811,
                    and reprinted in 1813. In 1810-11 he made extensive preparations, and sacrifices
                    which proved financially serious, with a view to accompany Sir R. Brownrigg to
                    Ceylon to explore that teeming though then almost unknown island; but the
                    disturbances created by the king of Candy led to the abandonment of the
                    projected expedition. Hooker immediately fixed his attention, however, on the
                    formation of an herbarium which was destined to-become the finest in Europe; and
                    in 1814 he spent nine· months in botanizing excursions in France, Switzerland,
                    and Northern Italy, during which he became acquainted with many of the leading
                    Continental botanists. The following year he married the eldest daughter of Mr
                    Dawson Turner, F.R.S., a lady who, during forty years, shared in the labours of
                    his study. Settling at Holes-worth<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0164-0153"/>, Suffolk, he continued to increase his herbarium,
                    which became the resort and admiration of British and Continental botanists. In
                    1816 appeared the <hi rend="italic">British Jungermannice,</hi> his first
                    scientific work, which is even now a model of microscopic dissection and of
                    accurate description and figuring. This was succeeded by a new edition of
                    Curtis’s <hi rend="italic">Flora Londinensis,</hi> for which he wrote the
                    descriptions (1817-28); by a description of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plantae</hi><hi rend="italic">Cryptogamicae</hi> of A. de Humboldt and A.
                    Bonpland; by the <hi rend="italic">Muscologia Britannica,</hi> a very complete
                    account of the mosses of Great Britain and Ireland, prepared in conjunction with
                    Dr T. Taylor (1818); and by his <hi rend="italic">Musci Exotici,</hi> 2 vols.
                    (1818-20), devoted to new foreign mosses and other cryptogamie plants. In 1820
                    he accepted the regius professorship of botany in Glasgow university, and
                    entered upon a new career of activity, in which he soon became popular as a
                    lecturer, his style being both clear and ready. The following year he brought
                    out the <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi><hi rend="italic">Scotica,</hi> in which the
                    natural method of arrangement of British plants was given with the artificial.
                    During the twenty years he remained at Glasgow he prepared and took part in many
                    works, the more important being the following</p>

                    >Letter</hi> on his grace’s death printed in 1840, calling attention to the
                    services rendered by him to botany and horticulture.</p>
                <p>It was mainly by Hooker’s exertions that botanists were appointed to the
                    Government expeditions. While his works were in progress his herbarium received
                    large and valuable additions from all parts of the globe, and his position as a
                    botanist was thus vastly improved. He received the honour of knighthood from
                    William IV. in 1836 in consideration of his meritorious researches in scientific
                    botany; and a few years later, in 1841, he was appointed director of the Royal
                    Botanical Gardens of Kew, on the resignation of Mr Alton. The attainment of this
                    post had long been the object of his life. The gardens flourished under his
                    administration; the Government had confidence in him; and his numerous friends
                    and correspondents took pride in contributing to the scientific needs of his
                    herbarium. From small beginnings the gardens expanded under his direction to 75
                    acres, with an arboretum of 270 acres; and three museums, enriched with many
                    thousand examples of vegetable products, have been added, forming together, with
                    the magnificent palm-house and conservatories, the most delightful and beautiful
                    resort that the inhabitants of London possess; while his extensive library of
                    reference and admirably arranged herbarium, the greater part of which was
                    presented by Sir William to the country, form a constant attraction to the
                    botanist. He was engaged on the <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Filicum</hi> with J. G. Baker when an epidemic at Kew brought his valuable life
                    to a close. He died August 12, 1865, in the eighty-first year of his age.</p>
