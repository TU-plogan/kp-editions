                    by the presbytery of Edinburgh in 1745. In the same year he joined as a
                    volunteer against the Pretender, and was taken prisoner at the battle of
                    Falkirk. Along with many others he was carried to the castle of Doune, from
                    which, however, he soon effected his escape. In July 1746 Home was presented to
                    the parish of Athelstaneford in Haddingtonshire, vacant by the death of Robert
                    Blair, the author of <hi rend="italic">The Grave.</hi> There he devoted himself
                    to dramatic literature, and his first production, <hi rend="italic">The Tragedy
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Agis,</hi> was finished in 1749. He took it to London
                    and submitted it to Garrick for representation at Drury Lane, but it was
                    rejected as unsuitable for the stage. Being but little disappointed, he
                    projected a new work, and having heard a lady sing the ballad of Gil Morice, he
                    formed the idea of <hi rend="italic">The Tragedy of Douglas,</hi> which after
                    five years’ labour he completed, and took to London for Garrick’s opinion. It
                    also was rejected, but on his return to Edinburgh his friends resolved that it
                    should be brought out in that city, where it met with overwhelming success, in
                    spite of the opposition of the clergy, who suspended one member of the
                    presbytery for a month for having attended its representation. As the author of
                    the tragedy might count on being dealt with yet more severely, Home resigned his
                    charge in 1757, and shortly afterwards he was appointed lecturer in a
                    Presbyterian chapel in Silver Street, London. In 1758 he became private
                    secretary to Lord Bute, then secretary of state; and three years later his
                    patron’s influence procured him a pension of £300 per annum. <hi rend="italic">A
                    Letter from a Blacksmith to the Ministers and Elders of the Church of
                    Scotland,</hi> in which the manner of public worship in that church is
                    considered, published in 1759, has been attributed to his pen. In 1760 Home
                    brought out another tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Siege of Aquileia,</hi> which
                    was put on the stage, Garrick taking the part of Aemilius. In 1763 he was
                    appointed to the sinecure office of conservator of Scots privileges at Campvere.
                    In 1769 Home’s tragedy of <hi rend="italic">The Fatal Discovery</hi> had a run
                    of nine nights; <hi rend="italic">Alonzo</hi> also (1773) had fair success in
                    the representation; but his last tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Alfred</hi> (1778),
                    was so coolly received that he gave up writing for the stage. From 1767 he
                    resided either at Edinburgh or at a villa which he built at K il luff near his
                    former parish. It was at this time that he wrote his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Rebellion of</hi> 1745, which appeared in 1802. Home died at Merchiston
                    Bank, near Edinburgh, in 1808, in his eighty-sixth year. He was a man of great
                    amiability of character, and numbered among his friends most of the Scottish
                    liter vti of the last century. His writings, while they display fervid feeling,
                    and have less artifici ιlity than the works of the poets of his time, are now,
                    with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Douglas,</hi> comparatively little
                    known.</p>
                <p>The works of Home were collected and published by Henry Mackenzie in 1822 (3
                    vols. 8vo), but several of his smaller poems seem to have escaped the editor’s
                    observation. These are—“The Fate of Caesar,” “Verses upon Inveraray,” “Epistle
                    to the Earl of Eglintoun,” “Prologue on the Birthday of the Prince of λVales,
                    1759,’’ and several “Epigrams,” which are printed in vol. ii. of <hi
                    rend="italic">Original Poems by Scottish Gentlemen,</hi> 1762.</p>
