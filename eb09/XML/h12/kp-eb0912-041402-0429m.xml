                    apprenticed to a lawyer. But as instead of copying law papers he was sometimes
                    found amusing his fellow-clerks with chemical experiments, his employer with
                    much sagacity advised that a more congenial profession thin the law should be
                    chosen for him. The young apprentice, released from his engagement, chose
                    medicine as the pursuit nearest akin to his favourite study of chemistry. He
                    studied for three years at Edinburgh, and completed his medical education by an
                    attendance of nearly two years at the medical classes in Paris, returning by the
                    Low Countries, and taking his degree of doctor of medicine at Leyden in 1749. At
                    the end of that year he came back to England, only to find, however, that though
                    he had qualified himself to practise as a medical man there seemed hardly any
                    opening for him. In the summer of the ensuing year he definitively abandoned the
                    idea of following out the medical profession, and, having inherited a small
                    property in Berwickshire from his father, resolved to devote himself to
                    agriculture. With the zeal and thoroughness characteristic of his disposition,
                    he then went to Norfolk to learn the practical work of farming. Thereafter he
                    extended his experience by a tour in Holland, Belgium, and the north of France.
                    During these years he began to study the surface of the earth, looking into
                    every pit, ditch, or river-bed that he saw, and gradually shaping in his mind
                    the problem to which he afterwards devoted his energies. In the summer of 1754
                    he established himself on his own farm in Berwickshire, where he resided for
                    fourteen years, and where he introduced the most improved forms of husbandry. As
                    the farm was brought into excellent order, and as its management, becoming more
                    easy, grew less interesting, he was finally induced to let it, and establish
                    himself for the rest of his life in Edinburgh. This took place about the year
                    1768.</p>
                <p>From this period until his death in 1797 he lived unmarried with his three
                    sisters. Surrounded by congenial literary and scientific friends, he devoted
                    himself to those researches which have had so important an influence upon <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0430-0415"/> the progress of science. At that time geology in
                    any proper sense of the term did not exist. Mineralogy, however, had made
                    considerable progress. Hutton’s taste for chemistry naturally led him into
                    mineralogy. But he had conceived larger ideas than were entertained by the
                    mineralogists of his day. He desired to trace back the origin of the various
                    minerals and rocks, ani thus to arrive at some clear understanding of the
                    history of the earth. For many years he continued to ponder over the subject,
                    making during that time many excursions to different parts of the country to
                    obtain materials for his researches, or to test the hypotheses he had been led
                    to form. At last, in the spring of the year 1785, he communicated his views to
                    the recently established Royal Society of Edinburgh in a paper entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Theory of the Earth, or an Investigation of the Laws Observable in
                    the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe.</hi> In
                    this remarkable work the doctrine is expounded that geology is not cosmogony,
                    but must confine itself to the study of the materials of the earth; that
                    everywhere evidence may be seen that the present rocks of the earth’s surface
                    have been formed out of the waste of older rocks; that these materials having
                    been laid down under the sea were there consolidated under great pressure, and
                    were subsequently disrupted and upheaved by the expansive power of subterranean
                    heat; that during these convulsions veins and misses of molten rock were
                    injected into the rents of the dislocated strata; that every portion of the
                    upraised land, as soon as exposed to the atmosphere, is subject to decay; and
                    that this decay must tend to advance until the whole of the land has been worn
                    away and laid down on the sea-floor, whence future upheavals will once more
                    raise the consolidated sediments into new land. In some of these broad and bold
                    generalizations Hutton was anticipated by the Italian geologists; but to him
                    belongs the credit of having first perceived their mutual relations, an 1
                    combined them in a luminous coherent theory everywhere based upon
                    observation.</p>
                <p>It was not merely the ground beneath us to which Hutton directed his attention.
                    He had long studied the changes of the atmosphere. The same volume in which his
                    <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Earth</hi> appeared contained also a <hi
                    rend="italic">Theory of Rain,</hi> which was read to the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh in February 1784. He contended that the amount of moisture which the
                    air can retain in solution increases with augmentation of temperature, and
                    therefore that on the mixture of two masses of air of different temperatures a
                    portion of the moisture must be condensed and appear in visible form. He
                    investigated the data available in his time regarding rainfall and climate in
                    different regions of the globe, and came to the conclusion that the rainfall is
                    everywhere regulated by the humidity of the air on the one hand, and the causes
                    which promote mixtures of different aeri ιl currents in the higher atmosphere on
                    the other.</p>
                <p>The vigour and versatility of his genius may be understood from the variety of
                    works which, during his thirty years’ residence in Edinburgh, he gave to the
                    world. In the year 1792 he published a quarto volume entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertations on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy,</hi> in which he
                    discussed the nature of matter, fluidity, cohesion, light, heat, and
                    electricity. Some of these subjects were further illustrated by him in papers
                    read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He did not restrain himself within
                    the domain of physics, but boldly marched into that of metaphysics, publishing
                    three quarto volumes with the title <hi rend="italic">An Investigation of the
                    Principles of Knowledge, and of the Progress of Reason—from Sense to Science and
                    Philosophy.</hi> In this work he develops the idea that the external world, as
                    conceived by us, is the creation of our own minds influenced by impressions from
                    without, that there is no resemblance between our picture of the outer world and
                    the reality, yet that the impressions produced upon our minds, being constant
                    and consistent, become as much realities tn us as if they precisely resembled
                    things actually existing, and therefore that our moral conduct must remain the
                    same as if our ideas perfectly corresponded to the causes producing them. His
                    closing years were devoted to the extension and republication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Theory of the Earth,</hi> of which two volumes octavo appeared in
                    1795. A third volume, necessary to complete the work, was left by him in
                    manuscript, and is referred to by his biographer Playfair, but seems to have
                    disappeared. No sooner had this task been performed than he set to work to
                    collect and systematize his numerous writings on husbandry, which he proposed to
                    publish under the title of <hi rend="italic">Elements of Agriculture.</hi> He
                    had nearly completed this labour when an incurable disease brought his active
                    career to a close on 26th March 1797.</p>
                <p>It is by his <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Earth</hi> that Hutton will be
                    remembered with reverence while geology continues to be cultivated. The author’s
                    style, however, being somewhat heavy and obscure, the book did not attract
                    during his lifetime so much attention as it deserved. Happily for science Hutton
                    numbered among his friends John Playfair, professor of mathematics in the
                    university of Edinburgh, whose enthusiasm for the spread of Hutton’s doctrine
                    was combined, with a rare gift of graceful and luminous exposition. Five years
                    after Hutton’s death he published a volume, <hi rend="italic">BBustratioηs of
                    the Huttonian Theory of the Earth,</hi> in which he gave an admirable summary of
                    that theory, with numerous additional illustrations and arguments. This work is
                    justly regarded as one of the classical contributions to geological literature.
                    To its influence niuch of the sound progress of British geology must be
                    ascribed. In the year 1805 a biographical account of Hutton, written by
                    Playfair, was published in vol. v. of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                    Royal Society of Edinburgh.</hi> (A. GE.)</p>
