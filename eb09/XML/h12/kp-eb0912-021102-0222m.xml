                <p><label type="entry">HORTICULTURE</label> embraces both the art and the science of
                    the cultivation of garden plants, whether for utilitarian or for decorative
                    purposes. The subject naturally divides itself into two sections, which we here
                    propose to treat separately, commencing with the science, and passing on to the
                    practice of the cultivation of flowers, fruits, and vegetables as applicable to
                    the home garden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> I.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Principles or Science of
                    Horticulture.</hi></p>
                <p>Horticulture, apart from the mechanical details connected with the maintenance of
                    a garden and its appurtenances, may be considered as the application of the
                    principles of vegetable physiology to the cultivation of plants. The lessons
                    derived from the abstract principles enunciated by the physiologist, the
                    chemist, and the physicist require, however, to be modified to suit the special
                    circumstances of plants under cultivation. The necessity for this modification
                    arises from the fact that such plants are subjected to conditions more or less
                    unnatural to them, and that they are grown for special purposes which are at
                    variance, in degree at any rate,, with their natural requirements.</p>
                <p>The life of the plant makes itself manifest in the processes of growth,
                    development, and reproduction. By growth is here meant mere increase in bulk,
                    and by development the series of gradual modifications by which a plant
                    originally simple in its structure and conformation becomes eventually
                    complicated, and endowed with distinct parts or organs. The reproduction of the
                    higher plants takes place either asexually by the formation of buds or organs
                    answering thereto, or sexually by the production of an embryo plant within the
                    seed. The conditions requisite for the growth, development, and reproduction of
                    plants are, in general terms, exposure, at the proper time, to suitable amounts
                    of light, heat, and moisture, and a due supply of appropriate food. The various
                    amounts of these needed in different cases have to be adjusted by the gardener,
                    according to the nature of the plant, its “habit” or general mode of growth in
                    its native country, and the influence to which it is there subjected, as also in
                    accordance with the purposes for which it is to be cultivated. &amp;c. It is but
                    rarely that direct information on all these points can be obtained; but
                    inference from previous experience, especially with regard to allied vegetable
                    forms, will go far to supply such deficiencies. Moreover, it must be remembered
                    that the conditions most favourable to plants are not always those to which they
                    are subjected in nature, for, owing to the competition of other vegetable forms
                    in the struggle for existence, liability to injury from insects, and other
                    adverse circumstances, plants may actually be excluded from the localities best
                    suited for their development. The gardener therefore may, by modifying, improve
                    upon the conditions under which a plant naturally exists. Thus it frequently
                    happens that in our gardens flowers have a beauty and a fragrance, and fruits a
                    size and savour denied to them in their native haunts. It behoves the judicious
                    gardener, then, not to be slavish in his attempts to imitate natural conditions,
                    and to bear in mind that such attempts must sometimes necessarily be failures.
                    The most successful gardening is that which turns to the best account the
                    plastic organization of the plant, and enables it to develop and multiply as
                    perfectly as possible. Experience, coupled with observation and reflexion, as
                    well as the more indirect teachings of tradition, are therefore of primary
                    importance to the practical gardener.</p>
                <p>We propose here to notice briefly the several parts of a flowering plant, and to
                    point out the rationale of the cultural procedures connected with them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Root.—</hi> The root, though not precluded from access of
                    air, is not directly dependent for its growth on the agency of light. The
                    efficiency of drainage, digging, hoeing, and like operations is accounted for by
                    the manner in which they promote aeration of the soil, raise its temperature,
                    and remove its stagnant or superfluous moisture. Owing to their growth in length
                    at, or rather in the immediate vicinity of, their tips, roots are enabled to
                    traverse long distances by surmounting some obstacles, penetrating others, and
                    insinuating themselves into narrow crevices. As they have no power of absorbing
                    solid materials, their food must be of a liquid or gaseous character. It is
                    taken up from the interstices between the particles of soil exclusively by the
                    finest subdivisions of the fibrils, and in many cases by the extremely delicate
                    thread-like cells which project from them, and which are known as root-hairs.
                    The number and density of these latter are in direct proportion to the abundance
                    and suitability of the food of the plant. The importance of the root-fibres, or
                    “feeding roots,” justifies the care which is taken by every good gardener to
                    secure their fullest development, and to' prevent as far as possible any injury
                    to them in digging, potting, and transplanting, such operations being therefore
                    least prejudicial at seasons when the plant is in a state of comparative
                    rest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Root-Pruning and Lifting.—</hi> In apparent disregard of the
                    general rule just enunciated is the practice of root-pruning fruit trees, when,
                    from the formation of wood being more active than that of fruit, they bear
                    badly. The contrariety is more apparent than real, as the operation consists in
                    the removal of the coarser roots, a process which results in the development of
                    a leash of fine feeding roots. Moreover, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n223/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0223-0212"/> there is a generally recognized quasi-antagonism
                    between the vegetative and reproductive processes, so that, other things being
                    equal, anything that checks the one helps forward the other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Watering.—</hi> So far as practical gardening is concerned,
                    feeding by the roots after they have been placed in suitable soil is confined
                    principally to the administration of water and, under certain circumstances, of
                    liquid manure; and no operations demand more judicious management. The amount of
                    water required, and the times when it should be applied, vary greatly according
                    to the kind of plant and the object for which it is grown, the season, the
                    supply of heat and light, and numerous other conditions, the influence of which
                    is to be learnt by experience only. The same may be said with respect to the
                    application of manures. The watering of pot-plants requires especial care. Water
                    should as a rule be used at a temperature not lower than that of the surrounding
                    atmosphere, and preferably after exposure for some time to the air.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bottom-Heat.—</hi> The “optimum” temperature, or that best
                    suited to promote the general activity of roots, and, indeed, of all vegetable
                    organs, necessarily varies very much with the nature of the plant, and the
                    circumstances in which it is placed, and is ascertained by practical experience.
                    Artificial heat applied to the roots, called by gardeners “bottom-heat,” is
                    supplied by fermenting materials, dung, tan, flues, or hot-water pipes. In some
                    cases solar heat is as it were entrapped by placing beneath the roots substances
                    such as bricks, the heat previously absorbed by which is slowly radiated. In
                    winter the temperature of the soil, out of doors, beyond a certain depth is
                    usually higher than that of the atmosphere, so that the roots are in a warmer
                    and more uniform medium than are the upper parts of the plant. Often the escape
                    of heat from the soil is prevented by “mulching,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    by depositing on it a thick layer of litter, straw, dead leaves, and the
                    like.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Stem</hi> and its subdivisions or branches lengthen, not
                    only near the tip, but also lower down, by intercalary growth. They upraise to
                    the light and air the leaves and flowers, and serve as channels for the passage
                    to them of fluids from the roots, and they act as reservoirs for nutritive
                    substances. Their functions in annual plants cease after the ripening of the
                    seed, whilst in plants of longer duration layer after layer of strong woody
                    tissue is formed, which enables them to bear the strains which the weight of
                    foliage and the exposure to wind, &amp;c., entail. The gardener aims usually at
                    producing stout, robust, short-jointed stems, instead of long lanky growths
                    defective in woody tissue. To secure these conditions free exposure to light and
                    air is requisite, but in the case of coppice woods, or where long straight spars
                    are needed by the forester, plants are allowed to grow thickly so as to ensure
                    development in an upward rather than in a lateral direction. This and like
                    matters will, however, be more fitly considered in dealing hereafter with the
                    buds and their treatment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leaves.—</hi> The work of the leaves may briefly be stated to
                    consist in the processes of nutrition and of respiration. Nutrition by the
                    leaves includes the inhalation of air, and the combination, under the influence
                    of light and in the presence of chlorophyll, of carbon from the carbonic acid
                    gas in the air with hydrogen from the watery vapour it contains, oxygen being
                    exhaled. There is also a process of true respiration, in which atmospheric
                    oxygen unites with a portion of the carbon in the plant, and is evolved as
                    carbonic acid gas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Syringing, &amp;c.—</hi> In certain circumstances water is
                    absorbed by the surface of leaves, especially when the supply of moisture at the
                    root is defective, and when by too long exposure to drought the watery
                    constituents of the plant have evaporated. A certain amount of evaporation of
                    superfluous watery fluid or vapour is a necessary accompaniment of nutrition,
                    but this may easily become excessive, especially where the plant cannot readily
                    recoup itself. In these circumstances such operations as “syringing” and
                    “damping down” are of special value. Evaporating basins or tanks in houses for
                    orchid and other plants are beneficial for like reasons. Following Boussingault
                    and Henslow, by whom the absorption of water by leaves has been proved, we may
                    sum up the advantages of syringing as follows :—it washes off dust and insects
                    from the leaves, and by moistening the cuticle promotes respiration and the
                    absorption of water; it checks loss by transpiration, and so enables terminal
                    shoots and young leaves to receive a sufficiency of sap from the stem; it keeps
                    the air cool by evaporation; and lastly, as moisture is actually imbibed by the
                    green parts of plants, it helps to compensate for any loss from within, and thus
                    supplements root absorption.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the facts just cited it is found that the preservation of cut
                    flowers is promoted by inserting some of their leaves as well as their stalks in
                    water. By cutting an herbaceous stem under water, so that the severed end is
                    never exposed to the air, withering can to a large extent be prevented; and a
                    bouquet may be kept fresh for a long time either by immersing the whole in
                    water, or by simply covering the vase of water in which it is placed with a
                    bell-glass. In the case of “cuttings” excessive transpiration is obviated by
                    means of bell-glasses and by shading, and sometimes by burying a portion of the
                    cutting with a leaf attached.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carnivorous Plants.—</hi> Before leaving the subject of
                    nutrition by leaves, reference may be made to the so-called carnivorous plants,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Drosera.</hi> Substances,
                    particularly such as contain nitrogen, as insects or fragments of meat, when
                    brought into contact with the surface of the leaves, or with certain glands on
                    the leaves, become dissolved by the agency of a digestive ferment secreted
                    therein, are then absorbed and serve as nutriment. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Insectivorous Plants.</hi><hi rend="italic">Respiration,</hi> already alluded
                    to, is not directly connected with exposure to light, since it goes on by night
                    as freely as by day. It is a process requisite for the health of the plant, and
                    contributes to maintain its heat, to perfect its structure, to eliminate some of
                    its secretions, and to destroy effete or impure matters. Chlorophyll, according
                    to Pringsheim, acts as a regulator of the respiration of plants by absorbing
                    some of the luminous rays, and thereby favouring the function of
                    assimilation.</p>
                <p>As a result of the processes carried on in the leaves under the influence of
                    light, many of the secretions, as starch, sugar, oils, and colouring and
                    odoriferous matters are formed. These either at once subserve the nutrition of
                    the plant or are stored in its tissues, as in the case of tubers and many seeds.
                    Usually before it can be rendered available as nourishment the stored matter has
                    to undergo a change from a more or less insoluble to a soluble form. The changes
                    which they undergo within the plant require very careful study, and indeed
                    constitute a department of physiology still very greatly in need of elucidation.
                    Pringsheim’s recent researches on the action of light on chlorophyll, prosecuted
                    with the aid of a small lens and observed under the microscope, bid fair, if
                    confirmed, materially to change the views of chemists as to the processes which
                    go on in leaves as a consequence of exposure to light; but, although they may
                    change or even reverse our notions as to the mode of action of chlorophyll, they
                    will not detract from its importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Buds.—</hi> The recognition of the various forms of buds, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0224-0213"/> and their modes of disposition in different
                    plants, on which see <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. pp. 95-99, 118,
                    119, is a matter of the first consequence in the operations of pruning and
                    training. Flower-buds may be produced on the old wood, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,e.,</hi> the shoots of the past year’s growth, or on a shoot of the present
                    year. The pear and rhododendron develop flowerbuds for the next season speedily
                    after blossoming, and these may be stimulated into premature growth. The
                    peculiar short stunted branches or “spurs” which bear the flowerbuds of the
                    pear, apple, and their allies, and of the laburnum, deserve special attention.
                    In the rose, in which the flowerbuds are developed at the ends of the young
                    shoot of the year, we have an example of a plant destitute of flowerbuds during
                    the winter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Propagation by Buds.—</hi> The detached leaf-buds <hi
                    rend="italic">(gemmoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bulbils')</hi> of some plants
                    are capable under favourable conditions of forming new plants. The edges of the
                    leaves of <hi rend="italic">Bryophyllum calycinum</hi> (see vol. iv. p. 98, fig.
                    67) and of <hi rend="italic">Cardamine pratensis,</hi> and the axils of the
                    leaves of <hi rend="italic">Lilium</hi><hi rend="italic">bulbiferum</hi> (iv.
                    99, fig. 71), produce buds of this character. It is a matter of familiar
                    observation that the ends of the shoots of brambles take root when bent down to
                    the ground. In rare instances buds form on the roots, and may be used for
                    purposes of propagation, as in the Japan quince. Of the tendency in buds to
                    assume an independent existence gardeners avail themselves in the operations of
                    striking “cuttings,” and making layers and “pipings,” as also in budding and
                    grafting. In taking a slip or cutting the gardener removes from the parent plant
                    one or more buds or “eyes,” in the case of the vine one only, attached or not to
                    a short shoot, and places them in a moist and sufficiently warm situation,
                    where, as previously mentioned, undue evaporation from the surface of the leaf
                    or leaves is prevented. For some cuttings pots filled with light soil, with the
                    protection of the propagating house and of bell-glasses, are requisite; but for
                    many, such as willows, no such precautions are necessary, and the thrusting of
                    the end of a shoot into moist ground suffices to ensure its growth. In the case
                    of the more delicate plants, the formation of roots is preceded by the
                    production from the cambium of the cuttings of a succulent mass of tissue, the
                    <hi rend="italic">callus.</hi> It is important in some cases to retain on the
                    cutting some of its leaves, so as to supply the requisite food for storage in
                    the callus. In other cases, where the buds themselves oontain a sufficiency of
                    nutritive matter for the young growths, the retention of leaves is not
                    necessary. In the tissues of willow-stakes just referred to there exists an
                    abundance of material available for the supply of the young roots. The most
                    successful mode of forming roots is to place the cuttings in a mild bottom-heat,
                    which expedites their growth, even in the case of many hardy plants whose
                    cuttings strike roots in the open soil. With some hard-wooded trees, as the
                    common white-thorn, roots cannot be obtained without bottom-heat. It is a
                    general rule throughout plant culture that the activity of the roots shall be in
                    advance of that of the leaves. Cuttings of deciduous trees and shrubs succeed
                    best if planted early in autumn while the soil still retains the solar heat
                    absorbed during summer. For evergreens April or May and August or September, and
                    for greenhouse and stove-plants the spring and summer months, are the times most
                    suitable for propagation by cuttings. The great object to be attained is to
                    secure the formation of active roots before the approach of winter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Layering</hi> consists simply in bending down a branch and
                    keeping it in contact with or buried to a small depth in the soil until roots
                    are formed; the connexion with the parent plant may then be severed. Many plants
                    can be far more easily propagated thus than by cuttings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Grafting or “working”</hi> consists in the transfer of a
                    branch, the “graft” or “scion,” from one plant to another, which latter is
                    termed the “stock.” The operation must be so performed that the growing tissues,
                    or cambium-layer of the scion, may fit accurately to the corresponding layer of
                    the stock. In <hi rend="italic">budding,</hi> as with roses and peaches, a
                    single bud only is implanted. <hi rend="italic">Inarching</hi> is essentially
                    the promotion of the union of one shoot to another of a different plant. The
                    outer bark of each being removed, the two shoots are kept in contact by ligature
                    until union is established, when the scion is completely severed from its
                    original attachments. This operation is varied in detail according to the kind
                    of plant to be propagated, but it is essential in all cases that the affinity
                    between the two plants be near, that the union be neatly effected, and that the
                    ratio as well as the season of growth of stock and scion be similar.</p>
                <p>The selection of suitable stocks is a matter still requiring much scientific
                    experiment. The object of grafting is to expedite and increase the formation of
                    flowers and fruit. Strong-growing pears, for instance, are grafted on the quince
                    stock in order to restrict their tendency to form “gross” shoots, and a
                    superabundance of wood in place of flowers and fruit. Apples, for the same
                    reason, are “worked” on the “paradise”or “doucin” stocks, which from their
                    influence on the scion are known as dwarfing stocks. Scions from a tree which is
                    weakly, or liable to injury by frosts, are strengthened by engrafting on robust
                    stocks. Lindley has pointed out that, while in Persia, its native country, the
                    peach is probably best grafted on the peach, or on its wild type the almond, in
                    England, the summer temperature of whose soil is much lower than that of Persia,
                    it might be expected, as experience has proved, to be most successful on stocks
                    of the native plum.</p>
                <p>The soil on which the stock grows is a point demanding attention. From a careful
                    series of experiments made in the Horticultural Society’s Garden at Chiswick, it
                    was found that where the soil is loamy, or light and slightly enriched with
                    decayed vegetable matter, the apple succeeds best on the doucin stock, and the
                    pear on the quince; aud where it is chalky it is preferable to graft the apple
                    on the crab, and the pear on the wild pear. For the plum on loamy soils the
                    plum, aud on chalky and light soils the almond, are the most desirable stocks,
                    and for the cherry on loamy or light rich soils the wild cherry, and on chalk
                    the “mahaleb” stock.</p>
                <p>The form and especially the quality of fruit is more or less affected by the
                    stock upon which it is grown. The Stanwick nectarine, so apt to crack and not to
                    ripen when worked in the ordinary way, is said to be cured of these propensities
                    by being first budded close to the ground, on a very strong-growing Magnum Bonum
                    plum, worked on a Brussels stock, and by then budding the nectarine on the
                    Magnum Bonum about a foot from the ground. The fruit of the pear is of a higher
                    colour and smaller on the quince stock than on the wild pear; still more so on
                    the medlar. On the mountain ash the pear becomes earlier.</p>
                <p>The effects produced by stock on scion, and more particularly by scion on stock,
                    are as a rule with difficulty appreciable. Nevertheless, in exceptional cases
                    modified growths, termed “graft-hybrids.” have been obtained which, have been
                    attributed to the commingling of the characteristics of stock and scion. Of
                    these the most remarkable example is <hi rend="italic">Cytisus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Adami,</hi> a tree which year after year produces some shoots,
                    foliage, and flowers like those of the common laburnum, others like those of the
                    very different looking dwarf shrub <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >purpureus,</hi> and others again intermediate between these. We may hence infer
                    that <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">purpureus</hi> was grafted or
                    budded on the common laburnum, and that the intermediate forms are the result of
                    graft-hybridization<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n225/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0225-0214"/>. Numerous similar facts have been recorded. Among
                    gardeners the general opinion is against the possibility of graft-hybridization.
                    The wonder, however, seems to be that it does not occur more frequently, seeing
                    that fluids must pass from stock to scion, and matter elaborated in the leaves
                    of the scion must certainly to some extent enter the stock. It is clear,
                    nevertheless, from examination that as a rule the wood of the stock and the wood
                    of the scion retain their external characters year by year without change.
                    Still, as in the laburnum just mentioned, in the variegated jasmine and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Abutilon Darwinii,</hi> in the copper beech and in the
                    horse-chestnut, the influence of a variegated scion has occasionally shown
                    itself in the production from the stock of variegated shoots. At a meeting of
                    the Scottish Horticultural Association (see <hi rend="italic">Gard.
                    G!ιron.,</hi> Jan. 10, 1880, fig. 12-14) specimens of a small roundish pear, the
                    “Aston Town,” and of the elongated kind known as “Beurré Clairgeau,” were
                    exhibited. Two more dissimilar pears hardly exist. The result of working the
                    Beurré Clairgeau upon the Aston Town was the production of fruits precisely
                    intermediate in size, form, colour, speckling of rind, and other
                    characteristics. Similar, though less marked, intermediate characters were
                    obvious in the foliage and flowers.</p>
                <p>Double grafting (French, <hi rend="italic">greffe sur greffe)</hi> is
                    sufficiently explained by its name. By means of it a variety may often be
                    propagated, or its fruit improved in a way not found practicable under ordinary
                    circumstances. For its successful prosecution prolonged experiments in different
                    localities and in gardens devoted to the purpose are requisite.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Planting.·</hi> —By removal from one place to another the
                    growth of every plant receives a check. How this check can be obviated or
                    reduced, with regard to the season, the state of atmosphere, and the condition
                    and circumstances of the plant generally, is a matter to be considered by the
                    practical gardener.</p>
                <p>As to season, it is now admitted with respect to deciduous trees and shrubs that
                    the earlier in autumn planting is performed the better; although some extendit
                    from the period when the leaves fall to the first part of spring, before the sap
                    begins to move. If feasible, the operation should be completed by the end of
                    November, whilst the soil is still warm with the heat absorbed during summer.
                    Attention to this rule is specially important in the case of rare and delicate
                    plants. Early autumn planting enables wounded parts of roots to be healed over,
                    and to form fibrils, which will be ready in spring, when it is most required, to
                    collect food for the plant. Planting late in spring should, as far as possible,
                    be avoided, for the buds then begin to awaken into active life, and the draught
                    upon the roots becomes great. It has been supposed that because the surface of
                    the young leaves is small transpiration is correspondingly feeble; but it must
                    be remembered, not only that their newly-formed tissue is unable without an
                    abundant supply of sap from the roots to resist the excessive drying action of
                    the atmosphere, but that, in spring, the lowness of the temperature at that
                    season in Great Britain prevents the free circulation of the sap. The
                    comparative dryness of the atmosphere in spring also causes a greater amount of
                    transpiration then than in autumn and winter. Another fact in ‰Vviir of autumnal
                    planting is the production of roots in winter.</p>
                <p>The best way of performing transplantation depends greatly on the size of the
                    trees, the soil in which they grow, and the mechanical appliances made use of in
                    lifting and transporting them. The smaller the tree the more success-f illy can
                    it be removed. The more argillaceous and the less siliceous the soil the more
                    readily can balls of earth be retained about the roots. All planters lay great
                    stress on the preservation of the fibrils; all indeed admit them to be
                    indispensable for the absorption of nutriment. The point principally disputed is
                    to what extent they can with safety be allowed to be cut off in transplantation.
                    Trees and shrubs in thick plantations, or in sheltered warm places, are ill
                    fitted for planting in bleak and cold situations. During their removal it is
                    important that the roots be covered, if only to prevent desiccation by the air.
                    Damp days are therefore the best for the operation; the dryest months are the
                    most unfavourable. Though success in transplanting depends much on the humidity
                    of the atmosphere, the most important requisite is warmth in the soil; humidity
                    can be supplied artificially, but heat cannot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pruning,</hi> or the removal of superfluous growths, is
                    practised in order to equalize the development of the different parts of trees,
                    or to promote it in particular directions so as to secure a certain form, and,
                    by checking undue luxuriance, to promote enhanced fertility. In the rose-b ush,
                    for instance, in which, as we have seen, the flower-buds are formed on the new
                    wood of the year, pruning causes the old wood to “break,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> to put forth a number of new buds, some of which will produce
                    flowers at their extremities. The manner and the time in which pruning should be
                    accomplished, and its extent, vary with the plant, the objects of the operation,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> whether for the production of timber or fruit, the
                    season, and various other circumstances. So much judgment and experience does
                    the operation call for that it is a truism to say that bad pruning is worse than
                    none. The removal of weakly, sickly, overcrowded, and gross infertile shoots is
                    usually, however, a matter about which there can be few mistakes when once the
                    habit of growth and the form and arrangement of the buds are known. Winter
                    pruning is effected when the tree is comparatively at rest, and is therefore
                    less liable to “bleeding” or outpouring of sap. Summer pruning or pinching off
                    the tips of such of the younger shoots as are not required for the extension of
                    the tree, when not carried to too great an extent, is preferable to the coarser
                    more reckless style of pruning. The injury inflicted is less and not so
                    concentrated; the wounds are smaller, and have time to heal before winter sets
                    in. The effects of badly-executed pruning, or rather hacking, are most
                    noticeable in the case of forest trees, the mutilation of which often results in
                    rotting, canker, and other diseases. Judicious and timely thinning so as to
                    allow the trees room to grow, and to give them sufficiency of light and air,
                    will generally obviate the need of the pruning-saw, except to a relatively small
                    extent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Training</hi> is a procedure adopted when it is required to
                    grow plants in a limited area, or in a particular shape, as in the case of many
                    plants of trailing habit. Judicious training also may be of importance as
                    encouraging the formation of flowers and fruit. Growth in length is mainly in a
                    vertical direction, or. at least at the ends of the shoots; and this should be
                    encouraged, in the case of a timber tree, or of a climbing plant which it is
                    desired should cover a wall quickly; but where flowers or fruit are specially
                    desired, then, when the wood required is formed, the lateral shoots may often be
                    trained more or less downward to induce fertility. The refinements of training,
                    as of pruning, may, however, be carried too far; and not unfrequently the
                    symmetrically trained trees of the French excite admiration in every respect
                    save fertility.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sports or Bud Variations.—</hi> Here we may conveniently
                    mention certain variations from the normal condition in the size, form, or
                    disposition of buds or shoots on a given plant. An inferior variety of pear, for
                    instance, may suddenly produce a shoot bearing fruit of superior quality; a
                    beech tree, without obvious cause, a shoot with finely divided foliage; or a
                    camellia an unwontedly fine flower. When removed from the plant and treated as
                    cuttings or grafts, such sports may be perpetuated. Many garden <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0226-0215"/> varieties of flowers and fruits have thus
                    originated. The cause of their production is very obscure. In certain instances
                    where plants have been “crossed” or hybridized, perhaps for generations, the
                    phenomenon may be explained on the supposition of a dissociation of previously
                    mixed elements, or of a reversion to some ancestral conditions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Flowers.—</hi> Flowers, whether for their own sake
                    or as the necessary precursors of the fruit and seed, are objects of the
                    greatest concern to the gardener. As a rule they are not formed until the plant
                    has arrived at a certain degree of vigour, or until a sufficient supply of
                    nourishment has been stored in the tissues of the plant. The reproductive
                    process of which the formation of the flower is the first stage being an
                    exhaustive one, it is necessary that the plant, as gardeners say, should get
                    “established” before it flowers. Moreover, although the green portions of the
                    flower do indeed perform the same office as the leaves, the more highly coloured
                    and more specialized portions, which are further removed from the typical
                    leaf-form, do not carry on those processes for which the presence of chlorophyll
                    is essential; and the floral organs may, therefore, in a rough sense, be said to
                    be parasitic upon the green parts. A check or arrest of growth in the vegetative
                    organs seems to be a necessary preliminary to the development of the flower. The
                    flower itself is always the modified extremity of a shoot or stalk, which only
                    exceptionally lengthens beyond the flower, as, for example, in “proliferous”

                <p>A diminished supply of water at the root is requisite, so as to check energy of
                    growth, or rather to divert it from leaf-making. Partial starvation will
                    sometimes effect this; hence the grafting of free-growing fruit trees upon
                    dwarfing stocks, as before alluded to, and also the “ringing” or girdling of
                    fruit trees, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the removal from the branch of a ring
                    of bark, or the application of a tight cincture, in consequence of which the
                    growth of the fruits above the wound or the obstruction is enhanced. On the same
                    principle the use of small pots to confine the roots, rootpruning and lifting
                    the roots, and exposing them to the sun, as is done in the case of the vine in
                    some countries, are resorted to. A higher temperature, especially with
                    deficiency of moisture, will tend to throw a plant into a flowering condition.
                    This is exemplified by the fact that the temperature of the climate of Great
                    Britain is too low for the flowering, though sufficiently high for the growth of
                    many plants. Thus the Jerusalem artichoke, though able to produce stems and
                    tubers abundantly, only flowers in exceptionally hot seasons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.</hi> —The operation of forcing is based upon the facts
                    just mentioned. By subjecting a plant to a gradually increasing temperature, and
                    supplying water in proportion, its growth may be accelerated; its season of
                    development may be, as it were, anticipated; it is roused from a dormant to an
                    active state. Forcing therefore demands the most careful adjustment of
                    temperature and supplies of moisture and light.</p>
                <p>Deficiency of light is less injurious than might at first be expected, because
                    the plant to be forced has stored up in its tissues, and available for use, a
                    reserve stock of material formed through the agency of light in former seasons.
                    The intensity of the colour of flowers and the richness of flavour of fruit are,
                    however, deficient where there is feebleness of light. Recent experiments of Dr
                    Siemens have shown that the gardener may avail himself of the electric light,
                    which is proved to exercise on chlorophyll the same kind of influence as do the
                    solar rays, and that he may thus supply the deficiencies of natural
                    illumination. The employment of that light for forcing purposes would seem to be
                    at present a question of expense. The great advantage hitherto obtained from its
                    use has consisted in the rapidity with which flowers have been formed and fruits
                    ripened under its influence, circumstances which go towards compensating for the
                    extra cost of production.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Double Flowers.—</hi> The taste of the day demands that “double
                    flowers” should be largely grown. Though in some instances, as in hyacinths,
                    they are decidedly less beautiful than single ones, they always present the
                    advantage of being less evanescent. Under the vague term “double” many very
                    different morphological changes are included. The flower of a double dahlia, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> offers a totally different condition of structure from
                    that of a rose or a hyacinth. The double poinsettia, again, owes its so-called
                    double condition merely to the increased number of its scarlet involucral
                    leaves, which are not parts of the flower at all. It is reasonable, therefore,
                    to infer that the causes leading to the production of double flowers are varied.
                    A good deal of difference of opinion exists as to whether they are the result of
                    arrested growth or of exuberant development, and accordingly whether restricted
                    food or abundant supplies of nourishment are the more necessary for their
                    production. It must suffice here to say that double flowers are most commonly
                    the result of the substitution of brightly-coloured petals for stamens or
                    pistils or both, and that a perfectly double flower where all the stamens and
                    pistils are thus metamorphosed is necessarily barren. Such a plant must needs be
                    propagated by cuttings. It rarely happens, however, that the change is quite
                    complete throughout the flower, and so a few seeds may be formed, some of which
                    may be expected to reproduce the double-blossomed plants. By continuous
                    selection of seed from the best varieties, and “roguing” or eliminating planta
                    of the ordinary type, a “strain” or race of double flowers is gradually
                    produced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Seed—Fertilization.—</hi> In fertilization— the
                    influence in flowering plants of the sperm-cell, or its contents upon the
                    germ-cell (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. 147, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Biology,</hi> vol. iii. 695)—there are many circumstances of
                    importance horticulturally, to which therefore brief reference must be made.
                    Flowers, generally speaking, are either self-fertilized, cross-fertilized, or
                    hybridized. Self-fertilization occurs when the pollen of a given flower affects
                    the germ-cell of the same individual flower. Such a flower is hermaphrodite
                    functionallyas well as structurally. Tn self-fertilizing flowers the structure
                    is such that the pollen inevitably comes in contact with the stigma; but
                    fertilization is also dependent on the simultaneous maturity of pollen . and
                    stigma. Cross-fertilization varies both in manner and degree. In the simplest
                    instances the pollen of one flower fertilizes the ovules of another on the same
                    plant, owing to the stamens arriving at maturity in any one flower earlier or
                    later than the pistils. Such flowers though structurally hermaphrodite are, at
                    any given time, functionally unisexual. In many plants a polymorphic condition
                    occurs: thus, in the same species of primrose some flowers have the stamens
                    short, and within the tube of the corolla, with the style projecting beyond the
                    mouth, giving the appearance termed “pin-eyed,” while others, known as
                    “thrum-eyed,” present exactly reverse conditions of stamens and style. In the
                    common loose-strife, <hi rend="italic">Lytlιrum Salicaria</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi> the stamens are of three lengths, and the styles differ
                    correspondingly. In such di-or tri-morρhic flowers, as Mr Darwin’s experiments
                    have shown, the most complete fertility occurs when a cross is effected between
                    a flower having short stamens and one with short styles. It is asserted that,
                    not only is such a union more fertile than when pollen from a short stamen is
                    placed on a long style, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> but the seedling
                    plants are as a rule more vigorous.</p>
                <p>Cross-fertilization must of necessity 'occur when the flowers are structurally
                    unisexual, as in the hazel, in which the male and female flowers are monoecious,
                    or <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n227/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0227-0216"/> separate on the same plant, and in the willow, in
                    which they are dioecious, or on different plants. A conspicuous example of a
                    dioecious plant is the common aucuba, of which for years only the female plant
                    was known in Britain. When, through the introduction of the male plant from
                    Japan, its fertilization was rendered possible, ripe berries, before unknown,
                    became common ornaments of the shrub.</p>
                <p>The conveyance of pollen from one flower to another in cross-fertilization is
                    effected naturally by the wind, or by the agency of insects and other creatures.
                    Flowers that require the aid of insects usually offer some attraction to their
                    visitors in the shape of bright colour, fragrance, or sweet juices. The colour
                    and markings of a flower often serve to guide the insects to the honey, in the
                    obtaining of which they are compelled either to remove or to deposit pollen. The
                    reciprocal adaptations of insects and flowers demand attentive observation on
                    the part of the gardener concerned with the growing of grapes, cucumbers,
                    melons, and strawberries, or with the raising of new and improved varieties of
                    plants. Scarcely less remarkable, though not so important in the present
                    connexion, are the means by which the visits of such insects as are useless for
                    the purpose of fertilization, or even injurious to the plant, as preying without
                    advantage to it on its secretions, are prevented or rendered ineffective. In
                    wind-fertilized plants the flowers are comparatively inconspicuous and devoid of
                    much attractions for insects; and their pollencells are smoother and smaller,
                    and better adapted for transport by the wind, than those of insect-fertilized
                    plants, the roughness of which adapt them for attachment to the bodies of
                    insects.</p>
                <p>Although the general facts with respect to fertilization are as above stated, it
                    must be remembered that probably self-fertilization is not constant in any plant
                    under all circumstances, and that it certainly does sometimes take place in
                    flowers which are usually cross-fertilized. It may be that, while continued
                    self-fertilization ensures the perpetuation of certain qualities,
                    cross-fertilization induces beneficial variation. Some botanists doubt the
                    injurious effects attributed to self-fertilization, and, so long as a plant is
                    healthy, it can be attended with but little disadvantage; but after a time in
                    any case a cross is probably useful, and sometimes fertility is found to be much
                    greater, and, in rare instances, only possible, when impregnation is effected by
                    pollen not produced by a flower’s own stamens.</p>
                <p>It is very probable that the same flower at certain times and seasons is
                    self-fertilizing, and at others not so. The defects which cause gardeners to
                    speak of certain vines as “shy setters,” and of certain strawberries as “blind,”
                    may be due either to unsuitable conditions of external temperature, or to the
                    non-accomplishment, from some cause or other, of cross-fertilization. In a
                    vinery or a peachhouse it is often good practice at the time of flowering to tap
                    the branches smartly with a stick so as to ensure the dispersal of the pollen.
                    Sometimes more delicate and direct manipulation is required, and the gardener
                    has himself to convey the pollen from one flower to another, for which purpose a
                    small camel’s-hair pencil is generally suitable. The degree of fertility varies
                    greatly according to external conditions, the structural and functional
                    arrangements just alluded to, and other causes which may roughly be called
                    constitutional. Thus, it often happens that an apparently very slight change in
                    climate alters the degree of fertility. Certain plants which seem almost sterile
                    with their own pollen become fertile if grafted on some others. In a particular
                    country or at certain seasons one flower will be self-sterile or nearly so, and
                    another just the opposite. The influence of conditions on the formation of
                    “races,” and the consequent importance to the horticulturist seeking to obtain
                    new and improved strains of crossing-plants grown in different localities, have
                    been specially insisted on by Darwin. The advantages of this practice are
                    analogous to those accruing from what gardeners call “change of seed,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the sowing of seed or the planting of tubers, say of
                    potatoes, in localities and on soils other than those in which they themselves
                    were produced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hybridization.—</hi> Some of the most interesting results and
                    many of the gardener’s greatest triumphs have been obtained by hybridization,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the crossing two individuals, not of the same but
                    of two distinct species of plants, as, for instance, two species of rhododendron
                    or two species of orchid. It is obvious that hybridization differs more in
                    degree than in kind from cross-fertilization. The occurrence of hybrids in
                    nature explains the difficulty experienced by botanists in deciding on what is a
                    species, and the widely different limitations of the term adopted by different
                    observers in the case of willows, roses, brambles, &amp;c. The artificial
                    process is practically the same in hybridization as in cross-fertilization, but
                    usually requires more care. To prevent self-fertilization, or the access of
                    insects, it is advisable to remove the stamens and even the corolla from the
                    flower to be impregnated, as its own pollen or that of a flower of the same
                    species is often found to be “prepotent.” There are, however, cases, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> some passion-flowers and rhododendrons, in which a
                    flower is more or less sterile with its own, but fertile with foreign pollen,
                    even when this is from a distinct species. It is a singular circumstance that
                    reciprocal crosses are not always or even often possible; thus, one rhododendron
                    may afford pollen perfectly potent on the stigma of another kind, by the pollen
                    of which latter its own stigma is unaffected. With respect to the relations of
                    the hybrid offspring, which partakes sometimes more of the characteristics of
                    the male or pollen parent, sometimes more of those of the female or seed-parent,
                    the opinions of practical experimenters are so diverse that at present no
                    general rule can be established. A valuable essay on the subject is the
                    presidential address read by Mr Anderson-Henry at the annual meeting of the
                    Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1867. A general <hi rend="italic"
                    >résumé</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the facts will be found in Darwin’s <hi

                    of flowers. See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Hybridism.</hi></p>
                <p>The object of the hybridizer is to obtain varieties exhibiting improvements in
                    hardihood, vigour, size, shape, colour, fruitfulness, or other attributes. His
                    success depends not alone on skill and judgment, for some seasons, or days even,
                    are found more propitious than others. Although promiscuous and hap-hazard
                    procedures no doubt meet with a measure of success, the best results are those
                    which are attained by systematic work with a definite aim. To secure early and
                    free-flowering varieties, Mr Henry advises “violent” crosses, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> crosses between varieties or species as distantly related as is
                    practicable. Careful experiments are still greatly needed for the elucidation of
                    the mysteries and the development of the resources of hybridization. It is
                    difficult to understand why some very closely-related species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the apple and pear, the currant and gooseberry, refuse to
                    intercross, while much more remote species, or even members of different genera,
                    can be made to do so, as in the case of the hybrid <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philageria</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle,</hi> 1872, p.
                    358), which is the result of a cross between the climbing plant <hi

                    buxifolia.</hi></p>
                <p>Hybrids are usually less fertile than pure-bred species, and are occasionally
                    quite sterile. Some hybrids, however, are as fertile as pure-bred plants. Hybrid
                    plants may be again crossed, or even re-hybridized, so as to produce a progeny
                    of very mixed parentage. This is the case with many of our roses, dahlias,
                    begonias, pelargoniums, and other long or widely cultivated garden plants.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Reversion.—</hi> In modified forms of plants there is
                    frequently a tendency to “sport” or revert to parental or ancestral
                    characteristics. So markedly is this the case with hybrids that in a few
                    generations all traces of a hybrid origin may disappear. The dissociation of the
                    hybrid element in a plant must be obviated by careful selection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Germination.—</hi> The length of the period during which seeds
                    remain dormant after their formation is very variable. The conditions for
                    germination are much the same as for growth in general. Access to light is not
                    required, because the seed contains a sufficiency of stored-up food. The
                    temperature necessary varies according to the nature and source of the seed.
                    Some seeds require prolonged immersion in water to soften their shells; others
                    are of so delicate a texture that they would dry up and perish if not kept
                    constantly in a moist atmosphere. Seeds buried too deeply receive a deficient
                    supply of air. As a rule, seeds require to be sown more deeply in proportion to
                    their size and the lightness of the soil.</p>
                <p>The time required for germination in the most favourable circumstances varies
                    very greatly, even in the same species, and in seeds taken from one pod. Thus

                    t</hi> though sown under precisely similar conditions, yet come up at very
                    irregular intervals of time. Germination is often slower where there is a store
                    of available food in the perisperm or albumen, or in the embryo itself, than
                    where this is scanty or wanting. In the latter case the seedling has early to
                    shift for itself, and to form roots and leaves for the supply of its needs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Selection.—</hi> Supposing seedlings to have been developed, it
                    is found that a large number of them present considerable variations, some being
                    especially robust, others peculiar in size or form. Those most suitable for the
                    purpose of the gardener are carefully selected for propagation, while others not
                    so desirable are destroyed; and thus after a few generations a fixed variety,
                    race, or strain superior to the original form is obtained. Many garden plants
                    have originated solely by selection; and it is certain that, quite independently
                    of cross-breeding, much could still be done to improve our breeds of vegetables,
                    flowers, and fruit by more systematic selection. The remarkable results obtained
                    in the case of Major Hallett’s pedigree wheat and Mr Bennett’s hybrid tea-roses
                    are instances in point. Two robust-growing varieties of potato, the “Magnum
                    Bonum” and the “Champion,” have been found to resist better than others the
                    attacks of fungus to which the plant is liable. Whatever may be the cause,
                    whether the possession by the tuber of a more than ordinarily thick skin, or
                    other peculiarity, it is obvious that selection with a view to the development
                    of this quality might be productive of the most important results. Darwin
                    recommends, as a means of improving health and fertility by intercrossing
                    without loss of purity of race, to sow in alternate rows seeds grown under as
                    different conditions as possible.</p>
                <p>Large and well-formed seeds are to be preferred for harvesting. The seeds should
                    be kept in sacks or bags in a dry place, and if from plants which are rare, or
                    liable to lose their vitality, they are advantageously packed for transmission
                    to a distance in bottles or jars filled with earth or sphagnum moss, without the
                    addition of moisture. Cuttings and entire plants may be transported in
                    widemouthed bottles.</p>
                <p>It will have been gathered from what has been said that seeds cannot always be
                    depended on to reproduce exactly the characteristics of the plant which yielded
                    them; for instance, seeds of the greengage plum or of the Ribston pippin will
                    produce a plum or an apple, but not these particular varieties, to perpetuate
                    which grafts or buds must be employed. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ. t. μ.)</hi><hi

                    Horticulture.</hi></p>
                <p>The details of horticultural practice naturally rang <hi rend="subscript">
                    es</hi> under the three heads of flowers, fruits, and vegetables. There are,
                    however, certain general aspects of the subject which will be more conveniently
                    noticed apart, since they apply alike to each department. We shall therefore
                    first treat of these under four headings :—formation and preparation of the
                    garden, garden structures and edifices, garden materials and appliances, and
                    garden operations.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Formation and Preparation of the Garden.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Site.—</hi> The site chosen for the mansion will more or
                    less determine that of the garden, the pleasure grounds and flower garden being
                    placed so as to surround or lie contiguous to it, while the fruit and vegetable
                    gardens, either together or separate, should be placed on one side or in the
                    rear, according to fitness as regards the nature of the soil and subsoil, the
                    slope of the surface, or the general features of the park scenery. In the case
                    of villa gardens there is usually little choice: the land to be occupied is cut
                    up into plots, usually rectangular, and of greater or less breadth, and in
                    laying out these plots there is generally a smaller space left in the front of
                    the villa residence and a larger one behind, the front plot being usually
                    devoted to approaches, shrubbery, and plantations, flower beds being added if
                    space pérmits, while the back or more private plot has a piece of lawn grass
                    with flower beds next the house, and a space for vegetables and fruit trees at
                    the far end, this latter being shut off from the lawn by an intervening screen
                    of evergreens. Between these two classes of gardens there are many gradations,
                    but our remarks will chiefly apply to those of larger extent.</p>
                <p>The almost universal practice is to have the fruit and vegetable gardens
                    combined; and the flower garden may sometimes be conveniently placed in
                    juxtaposition with them. When the fruit and vegetable gardens are combined, the
                    smaller and choicer fruit trees only should be admitted, such larger-growing
                    hardy fruits as apples, pears, plums, cherries, &lt;fcc., being relegated to the
                    orchard.</p>
                <p>Ground possessing a gentle inclination toward the south is desirable for a
                    garden. On such a slope effectual draining is easily accomplished, and the
                    greatest possible benefit is derived from the sun’s rays. It is well also to
                    have an open exposure towards the east and west, so that the garden may enjoy
                    the full benefit of the morning and evening sun, especially the latter; but
                    shelter is desirable on the north and north-east, or in any direction in which
                    the particular locality may happen to be exposed.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Soil and Subsoil.—</hi> A hazel-coloured loam, moderately
                    light in texture, is well-adapted for most garden crops, whether of fruits or
                    culinary vegetables, especially a good warm deep loam resting upon chalk; and if
                    such a soil occurs naturally in the selected site, but little will be required
                    in the way of preparation. If the soil is not moderately good and of fair depth,
                    the situation is not an eligible one for gardening purposes. Wherever the soil
                    is not quite suitable, but is capable of being made so, it is best to remedy the
                    defect at the outset; and as it will be found easier to render a light soil
                    sufficiently retentive than to make a tenacious clay sufficiently porous, a
                    light soil is to be preferred to one which is excessively stiff and heavy. It is
                    advantageous to possess a variety of soils; and if the garden be on a slope, it
                    will often be practicable to render the upper part light and dry, while the
                    lower remains of a heavier and damper nature.</p>
                <p>Natural soils consist of substances derived from the decomposition of various
                    kinds of rocks, the bulk consisting of clay, silica, and lime, in
                    various»proportions. As regards preparation, draining is of course of the utmost
                    importance.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0229-0218"/>
                <p>The ground should also be trenched to the depth of 3 feet at least, but the
                    deeper the better, provided the good soil be not buried under a mass of inferior
                    quality. In this operation all stones larger than a man’s fist must be taken
                    out, and all roots of trees and of perennial weeds carefully cleared away. When
                    the whole ground has been thus treated, a moderate liming will, in general, be
                    useful. After this, supposing the work to have occupied most of the summer, the
                    whole may be laid up in ridges, to expose as great a surface as possible to the
                    action of the winter’s frost.</p>
                <p>Argillaceous or clay soils are those which contain a large percentage (45-50) of
                    clay, and a small percentage (5 or less) of lime. These are unfitted for garden
                    purposes until improved by draining, liming, trenching, and the addition of
                    porous materials, such as ashes, burnt ballast, or sand, but when thoroughly
                    improved they are very fertile and less liable to become exhausted than most
                    other soils. Loamy soils contain a considerable quantity (30-45 per cent. ) of
                    clay, and smaller quantities (5 or less) of lime and humus. Such soils properly
                    drained and prepared are very suitable for orchards, and when the proportion of
                    clay is smaller (20-30 per cent.) they form excellent garden soils, in which the
                    better sort of fruit trees luxuriate. Marly soils are those which contain a
                    considerable percentage (10-20) of lime, and are called clay marls, loamy marls,
                    and sandy marls, according as these several ingredients preponderate. The clay
                    marls are, like clay soils, too stiff for garden purposes until ameliorated; but
                    loamy marls are fertile and well suited to fruit trees, and sandy marls are
                    adapted for producing early crops. Calcareous soils, which may also be heavy,
                    intermediate, or light, are those which contain more than 20 per cent, of lime,
                    their fertility depending on the proportions of clay and sand which enter into
                    their composition; they are generally cold and wet. Vegetable soils or moulds,
                    or humus soils, contain a considerable· percentage (more than 5) of humus, and
                    embrace both the rich productive garden moulds and those known as peaty
                    soils.</p>
                <p>The nature of the subsoil is of scarcely less importance than that of the surface
                    soil. If an unsuitable subsoil has to be dealt with, it must be removed or
                    ameliorated. An uneven subsoil, especially if retentive, is most undesirable, as
                    water is apt to collect in the hollows, and thus affect the upper soil. The
                    remedy is to make the plane of its surface agree with that of the ground. When
                    there is a hard pan this should be broken up, and if of bad quality the material
                    should be removed altogether. When there is an injurious preponderance of
                    metallic oxides or other deleterious substances, the roots of trees would be
                    affected by them, and they must therefore be removed. When the subsoil is too
                    compact to be pervious to water, effectual drainage must be resorted to; when it
                    is very loose, so that it drains away the fertile ingredients of the soil as
                    well as those which are artificially supplied, the compactness of the stratum
                    must be increased. The best of all subsoils is a dry bed of clay overlying
                    sandstone.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Size and Form,.—</hi> The general size of a garden adjoining
                    a mansion is from 4 to 6 acres; but in many places the extent varies from 12 to
                    20 or even 30 acres. A garden of 2 to 3 acres, enclosed by walls and surrounded
                    by slips, will, however, suffice for the supply of a moderate establishment.</p>
                <p>In laying out the garden, the plan should be prepared in minute detail before
                    commencing operations. The form of the kitchen and fruit garden should be square
                    or oblong, rather than curvilinear, since the working and cropping of the ground
                    can thus be more easily carried out. The whole should be compactly arranged, so
                    as to facilitate working, and to afford convenient access for the carting of the
                    heavy materials. This access is especially desirable as regards the store-yards
                    and framing ground, where fermenting manures and tree leaves for making up hot
                    beds, coals or wood for fuel, and ingredients for composts, together with flower
                    pots and the many necessaries of garden culture, have to be accommodated. In the
                    case of villas or picturesque residences, gardens of irregular form may be
                    permitted; when adapted to the conditions of the locality, they associate better
                    with surrounding objects, but in such gardens wall space is usually limited.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the garden area in walks, borders, and compartments must be
                    partly regulated by the outline of the ground. In general, a gravel walk, 6 or 8
                    feet broad, is led quite round the garden, both within and without the walls. A
                    walk of similar dimensions is often constructed in the centre of the garden in
                    the direction of the glazed houses, and this is sometimes crossed by another at
                    right angles, which is far preferable to having the walks led diagonally from
                    the corners, since this throws the enclosed plots out of the square. The space
                    between the wall and the walk that skirts it is called the wall-border, and is
                    commonly from 15 to 20 feet broad. On the interior of the walk there is usually
                    another border 5 or 6 feet broad, which is generally occupied by fruit trees,
                    trained either as espaliers, as dwarfs, or as pyramids. The middle part of the
                    garden is divided into rectangular compartments for raising the various culinary
                    crops. It is advantageous to have several small beds, in which to cultivate the
                    less bulky subjects, such as basil, sage, tarragon, &lt;fcc., which, in large
                    spaces, are apt to be overlooked or neglected.</p>
                <p>A considerable portion of the north wall is usually covered in front with the
                    glazed structures called forcinghouses, and to these the houses for ornamental
                    plants are sometimes attached; but a more appropriate site for the latter is the
                    flower garden, when that forms a separate department. It is well, however, that
                    everything connected with the forcing of fruits or flowers should be
                    concentrated in one place. The frame ground, including melon and pine pits,
                    should occupy some well-sheltered spot in the slips, or on one side of the
                    garden, and adjoining to this may be found a suitable site for the compost
                    ground, in which the various kinds of soils are kept in store, and in which also
                    composts may be prepared.</p>
                <p>As the walls afford valuable space for the growth of the choicer kinds of hardy
                    fruits, the direction in which they are built is of considerable importance. In
                    the warmer parts of the country the wall on the north side of the garden should
                    be so placed as to »face the sun at about an hour before noon, or a little to
                    the east of south; in less favoured localities it should be made to face direct
                    south, and in still more unfavourable districts it should face the sun an hour
                    after noon, or a little west of south. The east and west walls should run
                    parallel to each other, and at right angles to that on the north side, in all
                    the most favoured localities; but in colder or later ones, though parallel, they
                    should be so far removed from a right angle as to get the sun by eleven o’clock.
                    On the whole, the form of a parallelogram with its longest sides in the
                    proportion of about five to three of the shorter, and running east and west, may
                    be considered the best form, since it affords a greater extent of south wall
                    than any other. Mr Thompson, in the <hi rend="italic">Gardener</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s Assistant,</hi> gives a
                    figure which is nearly in this proportion (fig. 1), representing a small garden
                    272∣ feet by 160, and therefore containing exactly an acre. This figure admits
                    of nearly double the number of trees on the south aspect as compared with the
                    east and west; it allows a greater number of espalier or pyramid trees to face
                    the south; and it admits of being divided into equal principal compartments,
                    each of which forms nearly a square. The size of course can be increased to any
                    requisite extent. That of the royal gardens at Frogmore, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n230/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0230-0219"/> 760 feet from east to west, and 440 feet from
                    north to south, is nearly of the same proportions.</p>
                <p>The spaces between the walls and the outer fence are called slips. A considerable
                    extent is sometimes thus enclosed, and utilized for the growth of such
                    vegetables as potatoes, winter greens, and sea-kale, for the small bush fruits,
                    and for strawberries. The slips are also convenient as affording a variety of
                    aspects, and thus helping to prolong the season of particular vegetable
                    crops.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Shelter.—</hi> A screen of some kind to temper the fury of
                    the blast is absolutely necessary. If the situation is not naturally well
                    sheltered, the defect may be remedied by masses of forest trees disposed at a
                    considerable distance so as not to shade the walls or fruit trees. They should
                    not be nearer than say 50 yards, and may vary from that to 100 or 150 yards
                    distance according to circumstances, regard being had especially to
                    peculiarities occasioned by the configuration of the country, as for instance to
                    aerial currents from adjacent eminences. Care should be taken, however, not to
                    hem in the garden by crowded plantations, shelter from the prevailing strong
                    winds being all that is required, while the more open it is in other directions
                    the better. The trees employed for screens should include both those of
                    deciduous and of evergreen habit, and should suit the peculiarities of local
                    soil and climate. Of deciduous trees the sycamore, wych-elm, horse-chestnut,
                    beech, lime, plane, and poplar may be used,—the <hi rend="italic">Populus
                    canadensis nova</hi> being one of the most rapid-growing of all trees, and, like
                    other poplars, well-suited for nursing other choicer subjects; while of
                    evergreens, the holm oak, holly, laurel (both common and Portugal), and such
                    conifers as the Scotch, Weymouth, and Austrian pines, with spruce and silver
                    firs and yews, are suitable. The conifers make the most effective screens.</p>
                <p>Extensive gardens in exposed situations are often divided into compartments by
                    hedges, so disposed as to break the force of high winds. Where these are
                    required to be narrow as well as lofty, holly, yew, or beech is to be preferred;
                    but, if there is sufficient space, the beautiful laurel and the bay may be
                    employed where they will thrive. Smaller hedges may be formed of evergreen
                    privet, or of tree-box. These subordinate divisions furnish, not only shelter,
                    but also shade, which, at certain seasons, is peculiarly valuable.</p>
                <p>Belts of shrubbery may be placed round the slips outside the walls; and these may
                    in many cases, or in certain parts, be of sufficient breadth to furnish pleasant
                    retired promenades, at the same time that they serve to mask the formality of
                    the walled gardens, and are made to harmonize with the picturesque scenery of
                    the pleasure ground.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Water Supp&gt;ly.</hi> —Although water is one of the most
                    important elements in vegetable life, we do not find one garden in twenty where
                    even ordinary precautions have been taken to secure a competent supply.
                    Rain-water is the best, next to that river or pond water, and last of all that
                    from springs; but a chemical analysis should be made of the last before
                    introducing it, as some spring waters contain mineral ingredients injurious to
                    vegetation. Iron pipes are the best conductors; they should lead to a capacious
                    open reservoir placed outside the garden, and at the highest convenient level,
                    in order to secure sufficient pressure for effective distribution, and so that
                    the wall trees also may be effectually washed. Stand pipes should be placed at
                    intervals beside the walks and in other convenient places from which water may
                    at all times be drawn; and short flexible tubes should be made to fit on to
                    them, to which a garden hose can be attached, so as to permit of the whole
                    garden being readily and when necessary profusely watered. The mains should be
                    placed under the walks for safety, and also that they may be easily reached when
                    repairs are required. Pipes should also be laid having a connexion with all the
                    various greenhouses and forcing-houses, each of which should be provided with a
                    cistern for aerating the daily supplies. In fact, every part of the garden,
                    including the working sheds and offices, should have water supplied without
                    stint. At the same time it is not expedient to admit of large basins or ponds,
                    and far less of a running stream in a garden.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Approach and Fence.—</hi> The entrance to the garden from
                    without is a matter requiring the exercise of some taste and of sound judgment.
                    If possible, it should be from the south and front, so that the pleasing effect
                    of the range of glazed houses may be realized by the visitor on entering.
                    Sometimes a lateral entrance, leading from the flower-garden through an
                    intermediate shrubbery, and coming upon the hot-houses in flank, may be
                    necessary. The worst of all entrances is from the back or north, everything
                    being then viewed in reverse.</p>
                <p>All gardens of large extent should be encircled by an outer boundary, which is
                    often formed by a sunk wall or ha-ha surrounded by an invisible wire fence to
                    exclude ground game, or consists of a hedge with low wire fence on its inner
                    side. Occasionally this sunk wall is placed on the exterior of the screen
                    plantations, and walks lead through the trees, so that views are obtained of the
                    adjacent country. Although the interior garden receives its form from the walls,
                    the ring fence and plantations may be adapted to the shape and surface of the
                    ground. In smaller country gardens the enclosure or outer fence is often a
                    hedge, and there is possibly no space enclosed by walls, but some divisional
                    wall having a suitable aspect is utilized for the growth of peaches, apricots,
                    &amp;c., and the hedge merely separates the garden from a paddock used for
                    grazing. The still smaller gardens of villas are generally bounded by a wall or
                    wood fence, the inner side of which is appropriated to fruit trees. For the
                    latter, walls are much more convenient and suitable than a boarded fence, but in
                    general these are too low to be of much value as aids to cultivation, and they
                    are best covered with bush fruits or with ornamental plants of limited
                    growth.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Walks and Edgings.—</hi> The best material for the
                    construction of garden walks is good binding gravel. The ground should be
                    excavated to the depth of a foot or more,— the bottom being made firm and
                    slightly concave, so that it may slope to the centre, where a drain should be
                    introduced; or the bottom may be made convex and the water allowed to drain away
                    at the sides. The bottom 9 inches should be filled in compactly with hard coarse
                    materials, such as stones, brickbats, clinkers, burned clay, &amp;c., on which
                    should be laid two or three inches of coarse gravel, and then an inch or two of
                    firm binding gravel on the surface. The surface of the walks should be kept well
                    rolled, for nothing contributes more to their elegance and durability.</p>
                <p>All the principal lines of walk should be broad enough to allow at least three
                    persons to walk abreast; the others may be narrower, but a multitude of narrow
                    walks has a puny effect. Much of the neatness of walks depends upon the material
                    of which they are made. Gravel from an inland pit is to be preferred; though
                    occasionally very excellent varieties are found upon the sea-coast. The gravels
                    of Kensington and Blackheath have attained considerable celebrity, and have been
                    frequently employed in remote parts of the kingdom, the expense being lessened
                    by their being conveyed to different sea-ports as ballast for ships. Gravel
                    walks must be kept free from weeds, either by hand weeding, by occasionally
                    salting the surface, or by watering with boiling salt water. In some parts of
                    the country the available material does not bind to form a close even surface,
                    and such walks are kept clean by hoeing.</p>
                <p>Grass walks were common in English gardens during the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0231-0220"/> prevalence of the Dutch taste, but, owing to the
                    frequent humidity of the climate, they have in a great measure been discarded.
                    Their disuse is perhaps to be regretted, as in some situations, particularly
                    behind lengthened screens of trees, they form very agreeable promenades in dry,
                    hot weather. Grass walks were made in the same way as grass lawns. When the
                    space to be thus occupied had been prepared, a thin layer of sand or poor earth
                    was laid upon the surface, and over this a similar layer of good soil. This
                    arrangement was adopted in order to prevent excessive luxuriance in the
                    grass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Edgings.—</hi> Walks are separated from the adjoining beds and
                    borders in a variety of ways. If a living edging is adopted, by far the best is
                    afforded by the dwarf Dutch box planted closely in line. It is of extremely neat
                    growth, and, when annually clipped, will remain in good order for many years.
                    Very good edgings, but of a less durable character, are formed by thrift <hi
                    rend="italic">(Statice Armeria),</hi> double daisy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bellis</hi><hi rend="italic">perennis),</hi> gentianella <hi rend="italic"

                    finer grasses very carefully selected, such as the sheep’s fescue <hi

                    >or</hi> its glaucous-leaved variety. Indeed, any low-growing herbaceous plant,
                    susceptible of minute division, is suitable for an edging. Edgings may also be
                    formed of narrow slips of sandstone flag, slate, fire-clay tiles, bricks, glass,
                    or castiron. An excellent form of edging tile is that invented by Mr Stevens of
                    Trentham Gardens (fig. 2), which is made of a very durable kind of clay, and is
                    remarkably neat in appearance. It is 18 inches long, 5 inches deep, and 5 inches
                    broad, and, resting on the broad base, is held firmly by the gravel used for
                    filling up the walk. One advantage of using edgings of this kind, especially in
                    kitchen gardens, is that they do not harbour slugs and similar vermin, which all
                    live edgings do, and often to a serious extent, if they are left to grow large.
                    In shrubberies and large flower-plots, verges of grass-turf, from 1 to 3 feet in
                    breadth, according to the size of the border and width of the walk, make a very
                    handsome edging, but they should not be allowed to rise more than an inch and a
                    half above the gravel, the grass being kept short by repeated mowings, and the
                    edges kept trim and well-defined by frequently clipping with shears, and cutting
                    once a year with an edging iron.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Garden Structures.</hi></p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Gardener's Residence.—</hi> The gardener’s residence and the
                    apartments for the workmen should be within convenient distance of each other
                    and of the forcing-houses. The gardener’s house may stand in the centre of the
                    range of hot-houses, or it may be placed in one corner of the walled garden. In
                    either case it should communicate on the one side with the best part of the
                    garden, and on the other with the yard in which the garden offices are
                    placed.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Walls.—</hi> The position to be given to the garden walls
                    has been already referred to under par. 3. The shelter afforded by a wall, and
                    the increased temperature secured by its presence, are indispensable in the
                    climate of Great Britain, for the production of all the finer kinds of outdoor
                    fruits; and hence, the inner side of a north wall, having a southern aspect, is
                    appropriated to the more tender kinds. It is, indeed, estimated that such
                    positions enjoy an increased temperature equal to 7° of latitude; that is to
                    say, the mean temperature within a few inches of the wall is equal to the mean
                    temperature of the open plain 7° farther south. The eastern and western aspects
                    are set apart for fruits of a somewhat hardier character.</p>
                <p>Where the inclination of the ground is considerable, and the presence of high
                    walls would be objectionable, the latter may be replaced by sunk walls. These
                    should not rise more than 3 feet above the level of the ground behind them. As
                    dryness is favourable to an increase of heat, such walls should be either built
                    hollow, or packed behind to the thickness of 3 or 4 feet with rubble stones,
                    flints, brickbats, or similar material, thoroughly drained at bottom. For mere
                    purposes of shelter a height of 6 or 7 feet will generally be sufficient for the
                    walls of a garden, but for the training of fruit trees it is found that an
                    average height of 12 feet is most suitable. In gardens of large size the
                    northern or principal wall may be 14 feet, and the side walls 12 feet in height;
                    while smaller areas of an acre or so should have the principal walls 12 and the
                    side walls 10 feet in height. As brick is more easily built hollow than stone,
                    it is to be preferred for garden walls. A 14-inch hollow wall will take in its
                    construction 12,800 bricks, while a solid 9-inch one, with piers, will take
                    11,000; but the hollow wall, while thus only a little more costly, will be
                    greatly superior, being drier and warmer, as well as more substantial. Bricks
                    cannot be too well burnt for garden walls; the harder they are the less moisture
                    will they absorb. The darker colour they acquire when the process of burning is
                    prolonged is also more in harmony with the surrounding objects. At one time
                    brick walls were preferred on account of the facility they afforded for training
                    trees, but now cast-iron studs (fig. 3) or sometimes nails are placed in the
                    wall during its erection, being pushed into the joints before the mortar becomes
                    set, and ranged in straight lines, both vertically and horizontally; for
                    peaches, &lt;kc., they are placed 9 inches apart, and for pears, &amp;c., 15
                    inches. The trees are fastened to them by soft ligatures of twine or matting,
                    which should be twisted after being tied to the stud or nail, so as to prevent
                    contact between the branch and the metal. Many excellent walls are built of
                    stone. The best is dark-coloured whinstone, because it absorbs very little
                    moisture, or in Scotland Caithness pavement 4 inches thick. The stones can be
                    cut (in the quarries) to any required length, and built in regular courses.
                    Stone walls should always be built with thin courses for convenience of training
                    over their surface. Concrete walls, properly coped and provided with a trellis,
                    may in some places be cheapest, and they are very durable. Common rubble walls
                    are the wors of all.</p>
                <p>The coping of garden walls is important, both for the preservation of the walls
                    and for throwing the rain-water off their surfaces. It should not project less
                    than from 2 to 2∣ inches, but in wet districts may be extended to 6 inches.
                    Stone copings are best, but they are costly, and Portland cement is sometimes
                    substituted. Temporary copings of wood, which may be fixed by means of permanent
                    iron brackets just below the stone coping, are extremely useful ih spring for
                    the protection of the blossoms of fruit trees. They should be 9 inches or a foot
                    wide, and should be put on during spring before the blossom buds begin to
                    expand; they should have attached to them scrim cloth (a sort of thin canvas),
                    which admits light pretty freely, yet is sufficient to ward off ordinary frosts;
                    this canvas is to be let down towards evening, and drawn up again in the
                    morning. These copings should be removed when they are of no further utility as
                    protectors, so that the foliage may have the full benefit of rain and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"

                    radiation, though it may not keep the temperature much above freezing, will be
                    found sufficient. Standard fruit trees must be left to take their chance; and,
                    indeed from the lateness of their flowering, they are generally more injured by
                    blight, and by drenching rains, which wash away the pollen of the flowers, than
                    by the direct effects of cold.</p>
                <p>i Hot walls, whether constructed to be warmed by flues or hot-water pipes, are
                    nearly or quite obsolete. Their chief use is to assist in ripening the young
                    wood and the crops of the later varieties of tender fruits by the aid of
                    artificial heat, but the expenditure would be more usefully directed to the
                    construction of a glazed house for that purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Espalier Rails.—</hi> Subsidiary to walls as a means of
                    training fruit trees, espalier rails were formerly much employed, and are still
                    used in many gardens. In their simplest form, they are merely a row of slender
                    stakes of larch or other wood driven into the ground, and connected by a slight
                    rod or fillet at top. The use of iron rails has ,now been almost wholly
                    discontinued on account of metallic substances acting as powerful conductors of
                    both heat and cold in equal extremes. Trees trained to espalier rails have some
                    advantages, as they are easily got at for all cultural operations, space is
                    saved, and the fruit, while freely exposed to sun and air, is tolerably secure
                    against wind. They form, moreover, neat enclosures for the vegetable quarters,
                    and, provided excess of growth from the centre is successfully grappled with,
                    they are productive in soils and situations which are suitable.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Plant Houses.—</hi> These include all those structures
                    which are more intimately associated with the growth of ornamental plants and
                    flowers, and comprise conservatory, plant stove, greenhouse, and the subsidiary
                    pits and frames. They should be so erected as to present the smallest extent of
                    opaque surface consistent with stability. With this object in view, the early
                    improvers of hot-house architecture substituted metal for wood in the
                    construction of the roofs, and for the most part dispensed with back walls; but
                    the conducting power of the metal caused a great irregularity of temperature,
                    which it was found difficult to control; and, notwithstanding the elegance of
                    metallic houses, this circumstance, together with their greater cost, and some
                    doubt as to their durability, has induced most recent authorities to give the
                    preference to wood. The combination of the two, however, as in the Crystal
                    Palace at Sydenham, shows clearly that, without much variation of heat or loss
                    of light, any extent of space may be covered, and houses of any altitude
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>The earliest notice we have of such structures is given in the Latin writers of
                    the 1st century (Mart., <hi rend="italic">Epigr.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> y</hi> viii. 14 and 68); the Άδώνιδος κψroι, to which allusion is
                    made by various Greek authors, have no claim to be mentioned in this connexion.
                    Columella (xi. 3, 51, 52) and Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.N.,</hi> xix. 23) both
                    refer to their use in Italy for the cultivation of the rarer and more delicate
                    sorts of plants and trees. Seneca has given us a description of the application
                    of hot water for securing the necessary temperature. The botanist Jungermann had
                    plant houses at Altdorf in Switzerland; those of Loader, a London merchant, and
                    the conservatory in the Apothecaries’ Botanic Garden at Chelsea, were the first
                    structures of the kind erected in British gardens. These were, however, ill
                    adapted for the growth of plants, as they consisted of little else than a huge
                    chamber of masonry, having large windows in front, with the roof invariably
                    opaque. The next step was taken when it became fashionable to have
                    conservatories attached to mansions, instead of having them in the pleasure
                    grounds. This arrangement brought them within the province of architects, and
                    for nearly a century utility and fitness for the cultivation of plants were
                    sacrificed, as still is often the case, to the unity of architectural expression
                    between the conservatory and the mansion.</p>
                <p>Plant houses must be as far as possible impervious to wet and. cold air from the
                    exterior, provision at the same time being made for ventilation, while the
                    escape of warm air from the interior must also be under control. The most
                    important part of the enclosing material is necessarily glass. But as the rays
                    of light, even in passing through transparent glass, lose much of their energy,
                    which is further weakened in proportiqn to the distance it has to travel, the
                    nearer the plant can be placed to the glass the more perfectly will its
                    functions be performed; hence the importance of constructing the roofs at such
                    an angle as will admit the most light, especially sunlight, at the time it is
                    most required. Plants in glass houses require for their fullest development more
                    solar light probably than even our best hot-houses transmit,—certainly much more
                    than is transmitted through the roofs of houses as generally constructed.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Knight, an unquestionable
                    authority, proposed a general pitch or elevation of 34° for the latitude of
                    London, the angle at which the rays of the mid-day sun are perpendicular to the
                    surface on the 20th of May and 21st of July. This would afford four months, from
                    the 20th of April to the 21st of August, during which the angle of incidence at
                    mid-day would not at any time amount to 9, while the deviation at the winter
                    solstice would be 43°, and the loss of light from reflexion would be little more
                    than ⅛∙ <hi rend="superscript"> τhe an</hi> 8 <hi rend="superscript"> le of
                    45</hi> ° <hi rend="superscript"> ha3 becn</hi> recommended as a pitch extremely
                    suitable for early vineries and pine stoves, in which case the midsummer
                    deviation would be 19°, and the loss χ⅛, and the winter deviation 30°, the loss
                    being nearly the same. Greater exactness, however, has been sought in this
                    matter than is at all necessary. The reduction of the opacity of the roof
                    arising from the breadth and depth of rafters and astragals is of much more
                    consequence. The massive rafters, framed sashes, and inferior glass inserted in
                    small fragments, with numerous overlaps liable to be choked with dirt, intercept
                    a large proportion of the solar light and heat in ordinary glass
                    houses.</p></note></p>
                <p>Plant houses should be constructed of the best Baltic pine timber, as being the
                    most durable, but the whole of the parts should be kept as light as possible. In
                    many houses, especially those where ornament is of no consequence, the rafters
                    are now omitted, or only used at wide intervals, somewhat stouter sash-bars
                    being adopted, and stout panes of glass, 8 to 12 inches wide, made use of. Such
                    houses are very light; being also very close, they require careful ventilation.
                    The glass roof is commonly designed so as to form a uniform plane or slope from
                    back to front in lean-to houses (fig. 4), and from centre to sides in
                    span-roofed houses. In some cases, however, the roof sashes are fitted up on the
                    ridge-and-furrow principle invented by Sir Joseph Paxton, shown in fig. 5, which
                    represents the original ridge-and-furrow house erected by him at Chatsworth. To
                    secure the greatest possible influx of light, some scientific horticulturists
                    recommend curvilinear roofs; but the superiority of these is largely <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0233-0222"/> due to the absence of rafters, which may also be
                    dispensed with in plain roofs. Span and ridge-and-furrow roofs, the forms now
                    mostly preferred, are exceedingly well adapted for the admission of light,
                    especially when they are glazed to within a few inches of the ground. They can
                    be made, too, to cover in any extent of area without sustaining walls. Indeed,
                    it has been proposed to support such roofs to a great extent upon suspension
                    principles, the internal columns of support being utilized for con ducting the
                    rain-water off the roof to underground drains or reservoirs. The lean-to is the
                    least desirable form, since it scarcely admits of elegance of design, but it is
                    necessarily adopted in some cases.</p>
                <p>In glazing, the greater the surface of glass, and the less space occupied by
                    rafters and astragals as well as overlaps, the greater the admission of light.
                    Some prefer that the sash-bars should be grooved instead of rebated, and this
                    plan exposes less putty to the action of the weather. The simple bedding of the
                    glass, without the use of over putty, seems to be widely approved; but the glass
                    may be fixed in a variety of other ways, some of which are patented. In Beard’s
                    method (a very good one) the glass is fixed between strips of felt, the covering
                    bar being held in position by white metal nuts tightly screwed. Good results
                    have also been obtained from the system introduced and improved by Rendle, which
                    covers all the framework of the roof, so that the timber is not exposed to the
                    vicissitudes of weather.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Conservatory</hi> is often built in connexion with the
                    mansion, so as to be entered from the drawing-room or boudoir. But when so
                    situated it is apt to suffer from the shade of the building, and is
                    objectionable on account of admitting damp to the drawingroom. Where
                    circumstances will admit, it is better to place it at some distance from the
                    house, and to form a connexion by means of a glass corridor. In order that the
                    conservatory may be kept gay with flowers, there should be a subsidiary
                    structure to receive the plants as they go out of bloom. The conservatory may
                    also with great propriety be placed in the flower garden, where it may occupy an
                    elevated terrace, and form the termination of one of the more important
                    walks.</p>
                <p>Great variety of design is admissible in the conservatory, but it ought always to
                    be adapted to the style of the mansion of which it is a prominent appendage.
                    Some very pleasing examples are to be met with which have the form of a
                    parallelogram with a lightly rounded roof; others of appropriate character are
                    square or nearly so, with a ridge-and-furrow roof. Whatever the form, there must
                    be light in abundance; and the shade both of buildings and of trees must be
                    avoided. A southern aspect, or one varying to south-east or south-west, is
                    preferable; if these aspects cannot be secured, the plants selected must be
                    adapted to the position. The central part of the house may be devoted to
                    permanent plants; the side tables and open spaces in the permanent beds should
                    be reserved for the temporary plants.</p>
                <p>The kind of plants adapted for planting out in conservatories are palms, cycads,
                    dracaenas, aralias, luculias, camellias, &amp;c., with fuchsias, habrothamnus,
                    plumbago, strong-growing scarlet pelargoniums, &amp;c., on the pillars, and
                    tacsonias, passifloras, lapagerias, &amp;c., on the roof.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Greenhouse</hi> is a structure designed for the growth of
                    such exotic plants as require to be kept during winter in a temperature
                    considerably above the freezing-point. The best form is the span-roofed, a
                    single span being better even than a series of spans such as form the
                    ridge-and-furrow roof. For plant culture, houses at a comparatively low pitch
                    are better than higher ones where the plants have to stand at a greater distance
                    from the glass, and therefore in greater gloom. Fig. 6 represents a form of
                    house adopted by a most successful cultivator, Mr B. S. Williams, of Holloway.
                    It is 20 feet wide and 12 feet high, the length in this case being 50 feet, but
                    of course any other convenient length could be adopted. The side walls are
                    surmounted by short upright sashes which open outwards by machinery <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and the roof is provided with sliding upper sashes for top
                    ventilation. In the centre is a two-tier stage for plants, 6 feet wide, with a
                    pathway on each side 3 feet wide, and a side table 4 feet wide, the side tables
                    being flat, and the centre stage having the middle portion one-third of the
                    width elevated 1 foot above the rest, so as to lift up the middle row of plants
                    nearer the light. Span-roofed houses of this character should run north and
                    south so as to secure an equalization of light, and should be warmed by two
                    4-inch hot-water pipes carried under the side tables along each side and across
                    each end. Where it is desired to cultivate a large number of plants, it is much
                    better to increase the number of such houses than to provide larger structures.
                    The smaller houses are far better for cultural purposes, while the plants can be
                    classified, and the little details of management more conveniently attended to.
                    Pelargoniums, cinerarias, calceolarias, cyclamens, camellias, heaths, Australian
                    plants, roses, and other specialities might thus have to themselves either a
                    whole house or part of a house, the conditions of which could then be more
                    accurately fitted to the wants of the inmates.</p>
                <p>The lean-to house is in most respects inferior to the span-roofed; one of the
                    latter could be converted into two of the former of opposite aspects by a
                    divisional wall along the centre. Except where space does not permit a
                    span-roofed building to be introduced, a lean-to is not to be recommended; but a
                    house of this class may often be greatly improved by adopting a half-span or
                    hipped roof (as in fig. 9), that is, one with a short slope behind and a longer
                    in front.</p>
                <p>Where the cultivation of large specimens of heaths, Australian plants, Indian
                    azaleas, &amp;c., has to be carried on, a span-roofed house of greater height
                    and larger dimensions may sometimes prove useful; but space for this class of
                    plants may generally be secured in a house of the smaller elevation, simply by
                    lowering or removing altogether the staging erected for smaller plants, and
                    allowing the larger ones to stand on or nearer the floor.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Plant Stove</hi> differs in no respect from the greenhouse
                    except in having a greater extent of hot-water pipes for the purpose of securing
                    a greater degree of heat, although, as the plants in stove houses often attain a
                    larger size, and many of them require a tan bed to supply them with bottom heat,
                    a somewhat greater elevation may perhaps be occasionally required in some of the
                    houses. For the smaller plants, and for all choicer subjects, the smaller size
                    of house already recommended for greenhouses, namely, 20 feet wide and 12 feet
                    high, with a side table of 4 feet on each side, a pathway of 3 feet, and a
                    central stage on two levels of 6 feet wide, will be preferable, because more
                    easily managed as to the supply of heat and moisture. Mr Williams’s plant stove
                    (fig. 7), which is a very good model, is of the foregoing dimensions. It has,
                    however, a diflerent arrangement from the greenhouse as to ventilation. It will
                    be seen that along the ridge of the roof a raised portion or lantern light δ,
                    &amp; is introduced, whicli permits of the fixing of two continuous ventilators,
                    one along each side, for the egress of heated and foul air, openings <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a</hi> being also provided in the side walls opposite the
                    hot-water pipes for the admission of pure cold air.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n234/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0234-0223"/>
                <p>Three or four rows of pipes will be required on each side, according to the heat
                    proposed to be maintained.</p>
                <p>In their interior fittings plant stoves require more care than greenhouses, which
                    are much drier, and in which consequently the staging does not so soon decay. In
                    stoves the tables should always be of slate or stone, and the supports of iron;
                    slate is now most commonly used. This should be covered with a layer of 2 or 3
                    inches of some coarse gritty material, such as pounded spar, or the shell sand
                    obtained on the sea-coast, on which the pots are to stand; its use is to absorb
                    moisture and gradually give it out for the benefit of the plants. The pathways
                    should be paved, or made of concrete and cement, and the surface should be
                    gently rounded so that the water required for evaporation may drain to the sides
                    while the centre is sufficiently dry to walk upon; they should also have brick
                    or stone edgings to prevent the water so applied soaking away at the sides and
                    thus being wasted.</p>
                <p>The greenhouses, if large and ornamental, should be contiguous to the flower
                    garden or pleasure ground; but if of the simple character employed only for
                    growing decorative plants, it is better to associate them with similar houses
                    set^apart for other purposes, in an enclosed portion of the grounds contiguous
                    to the potting sheds, where fuel and other materials required can be
                    conveniently stored, and where all the untidiness of the workshops may be
                    masked. For this reason it is a very convenient plan to place side by side a
                    series of small span-roofed houses for growing plants, where they can be
                    connected by a glazed passage-way at the back. The glazed way may be utilized
                    for the cultivation of plants requiring less light than others, such as ferns,
                    camellias, &amp;c.; it should communicate with the workmen’s offices, which are
                    commonly placed on the north side of the garden wall, so that potting and other
                    cultural operations may be carried on without creating a block or confusion in
                    the several houses. Wherever plahed, it is imperative that all plant houses
                    should have a free and abundant admission of light.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Fruit Houses.—</hi> The principal of these are the vinery,
                    pinery, peach house, cucumber and melon house, and orchard house. These or a
                    portion of them, especially the vineries and peacheries, are frequently br'".ght
                    together into a range along the principal interior or south wall o£ the garden,
                    where they are well exposed to sun and light, an ornamental plant house being
                    sometimes introduced into the centre of the range in order to give effect to the
                    outline of the buildings. When thus associated, the houses are usually of the
                    lean-to class, which have the advantage of being more easily warmed and kept
                    warm than buildings having glass on both sides, a matter of great importance for
                    forcing purposes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vinery</hi> is a house devoted to the culture of the
                    grape-vine, which is by far the most important exotic fruit cultivated in
                    English gardens. When forming part of a range a vinery would in most cases be a
                    lean-to structure, with a sharp pitch (45°-50°) if intended for early forcing,
                    and a flatter roof (40°) with longer rafters if designed for the main or late
                    crops. Mr A. F. Barron, a recognized authority on grape growing, recommends in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Floriat</hi><hi rend="italic">and Pomologist</hi> (1879,
                    p. 37) three classes of vineries, namely, <hi rend="italic">early</hi> for the
                    production of early or forced grapes, <hi rend="italic">general-crop</hi> for
                    all unheated grape houses, and <hi rend="italic">late</hi> for producing and
                    keeping grapes till late in the season, each requiring its own special
                    arrangements. The following are the three forms of houses recommended by him.
                    (1) The <hi rend="italic">lean-to</hi> (fig. 8) is the simplest form, often
                    erected against some existing wall, and the best for early forcing, being warmer
                    on account of the shelter afforded by the back wall. In this house the principal
                    ρaι ’ t of the roof is a fixture, ventilation being provided for by small
                    lifting sashes against the back wall, and by the upright front sashes being hung
                    on a pivot so as. to swing outwards on the lower side. The necessary heat is
                    provided by four 4-inch hot-water pipes, which would perhaps be best placed if
                    all laid side by side, while the vines are planted in front, and trained upwards
                    under the roof. A second set of vines may be planted against the back wall, and
                    will thrive there until the shade of the roof becomes too dense.</p>
                <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">hipped-roofed</hi> or three-quarter span (fig. 9) is a
                    combination of the lean-to and the span-roofed, uniting to a great degree the
                    advantages of both, being warmer than the span and lighter than the lean-to. The
                    heating and ventilating arrangements are much the same as in the lean-to, only
                    the top sashes which open are on the back slope, and therefore do not interfere
                    so much with the vines on the front slope. In both this and the lean-to the
                    aspect should be as nearly due south as possible. Houses of this form are
                    excellent for general purposes, and they are well adapted both for muscats,
                    which require a high temperature, and for late-keeping grapes.</p>
                <p>(3) The <hi rend="italic">span-roofed</hi> (fig. 10), the most elegant and
                    ornamental form, is especially adapted for isolated positions; indeed, no other
                    form affords so much roof space for the development of the vines. The amount of
                    light admitted being very great, these houses answer well for general purposes
                    and for the main crop. The large amount of glass or cooling surface, however,
                    makes it more difficult to keep up a high and regular temperature in them, and
                    from this cause they are not so well adapted for very early or very late crops.
                    They are best, nevertheless, when grapes and ornamental plants are grown in the
                    same house, except, indeed, in very wet and cold districts, where, in
                    consequence of its greater warmth, the lean-to is to be preferred.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pinery</hi> is a house devoted to the cultivation of the
                    pineapple. The pineries or pine stoves of former times were generally large
                    lofty structures of the lean-to vinery fashion, and heated by smoke flues; but
                    these were superseded by buildings of more compact form, such as that of
                    Baldwin,, a noted pine grower of his 4ay, in which the low roof was hipped, the
                    short or northern slope being of slate, and the glazed sashes being fixtures.
                    These were again improved by the substitution of glass for slate in the back
                    slope, and of hot-water pipes for smoke flues as the heating medium, openings
                    being provided at back and front, as at <hi rend="italic">a, a</hi> (fig. 11),
                    for ventilation. Such houses as these are low, and therefore are more
                    economically kept at the high temperature necessary for pine growing. The best
                    form of pinery is a low structure of this kind, but somewhat wider, so as to
                    permit of the utilization of the front and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0235-0224"/> spaces for general forcing purposes (fig 12).
                    Such a house might be 14 feet wide, consisting of a plunging bed for bottom heat
                    8 feet wide, a back path of 2 feet provided with a shelf for strawberries near
                    the glass, a front path of 2 feet, and between that and the front wall a stage
                    for pots, which might be used for forcing French beans, and which should be on
                    the same level as the front curb of the centre pit, and about 2⅛ feet from the
                    glass. The height of the back wall should be 15 feet. The house should be heated
                    by three or four hot-water pipes placed beneath the front stage, and two placed
                    close to the wall in the back path; and the necessary bottom heat should be
                    provided by fermenting tan or leaves, or by hot-water pipes or a hot-water tank
                    placed beneath the plunging bed. Ventilators should be fixed at short intervals
                    in the front wall beneath the stage and opposite the heating pipes; and the
                    alternate upper sashes should be made to open, or corresponding ventilators
                    close to the top of the back wall should be provided.</p>
                <p>If the stock of pine plants is not extensive, certain and abundant crops of fruit
                    cannot be expected; and it is therefore necessary to have not only fruiting
                    pineries but pineries for succession plants. These are generally called <hi
                    rend="italic">pine pits,</hi> and differ little from the pits used for
                    accommodating other tender plants. Two or three succession pits are required to
                    provide a stock of plants to keep the fruiting-house filled. Low-roofed pits are
                    to be preferred, not only on account of their appearance, but because the pine
                    can only be cultivated in its highest state of perfection when grown in pits
                    just sufficient for the full development of the foliage and crown of the fruit.
                    These pits, if span-roofed, should be provided with a central path under the
                    ridge, just high enough for a workman to stand upright, and a plunging-pit on
                    each side; but any ordinary well-constructed pit will answer the purpose if
                    sufficiently heated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Peach House</hi> is a structure in which the ripening of
                    the fruit is accelerated by the judicious employment of artificial heat. For
                    early forcing, as in vineries, the lean-to form is to be preferred, and the
                    house may have a tolerably sharp pitch. A width of 7 or 8 feet, with the glass
                    slope continued down to within a foot or two of the ground, and without any
                    upright front sashes, will be suitable for such a house, which may also be
                    conveniently divided into compartments of from 30 to 50 feet in length according
                    to the extent of the building, small houses being preferable to larger ones. As
                    a very high temperature is not required, two or three pipes running the whole
                    length of the house will suffice. The front wall should be built on piers and
                    arches to allow the roots to pass outwards into a prepared border, the trees
                    being planted just within the house. Abundant means of ventilation should be
                    provided.</p>
                <p>For more general purposes the house represented in fig. 13 will be found more
                    useful. One set of trees is planted near the front, and trained to an arched
                    trellis <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Another set is planted at the back, and
                    trained on a trellis <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which is nearly upright, and
                    leans against the back wall; or the back wall itself may be used for training.
                    There are no upright front sashes, but to facilitate, ventilation there are
                    ventilators <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in the front wall, and the upper roof
                    sashes are made to move up and down for the same object. Two or three hot-water
                    pipes are placed near the front wall. The back wall is usually planted with
                    dwarf and standard trees alternately, the latter being temporary, and intended
                    to furnish the upper part of the trellis, while the permanent dwarfs are
                    gradually filling up the trellis from below. In any case the front trellis
                    Should stop conveniently short of the top of the sashes if there are trees
                    against the back wall, in order to admit light to them. They would also be
                    better carried up nearly parallel to the roof, and at about 1 foot distant from
                    it, supposing there were no trees at the back.</p>
                <p>A span-roofed house, being lighter than a lean-to, would be so much the better
                    for peach culture, especially for the crop grown just in anticipation of those
                    from the open walls, since a high temperature is not required. A low span, with
                    dwarf side walls, and a lantern ventilator along the ridge, the height in the
                    centre being 9 feet, would be very well adapted for the purpose. The trees
                    should be planted inside and trained up towards the ridge on a trellis about a
                    foot from the glass, the walls being arched to permit the egress of the roots. A
                    trellis path should run along the centre, and movable pieces of trellis should
                    be provided to prevent trampling on the soil while dressing and tying in the
                    young wood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Cucumber and Melon House.—</hi> Wherever a continuous
                    supply of cucumbers and a considerable number of melons are required, it is
                    found most convenient to grow them in houses, the attention required and the
                    risk of failures being much less than when hotbeds and pits heated by fermenting
                    materials are employed. The best form of house is a narrow span (fig. 14), on
                    account of the much greater amount of light which it admits. The width should be
                    12 feet, the height about 10 feet, and the length divided into short portions so
                    as to be worked in succession; a 60-feet house divided into three 20-feet
                    portions would be found very useful, as one or more could be taken for either
                    crop according to the demand. The inside arrangements should include a pathway
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of 3 feet in the centre, two beds <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> provided with hot-water pipes c, <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> or hθt-water tank for bottom heat, two pipes <hi
                    rend="italic">d, d</hi> on each side for warming the atmosphere, a lantern
                    ventilator <hi rend="italic">e</hi> at the ridge, and openings in the
                    wall/beneath the beds to admit fresh air, and a trellis <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    for training the plants, fixed at 12 or 18 inches from the roof.</p>
                <p>Where the house is built against a wall, the hipped form of roof is to be
                    preferred, as it will admit more light, and also allows more space for the
                    cucumber or melon vines. Fig. 15, from Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the
                    Cucumber,</hi> shows such a structure, in which <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the
                    pathway, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> front ventilator, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    back ventilator, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> hot-water pipes, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> tank for bottom heat. The cold air admitted at <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    enters a chamber <hi rend="italic">g</hi>; thence it passes into the space <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n236/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0236-0225"/><hi rend="italic">h</hi> over the water in the
                    tank, and is admitted through a tube <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> which passes up
                    through the bed of soil, into the house near the front; similar tubes <hi
                    rend="italic">ή,</hi> inserted at intervals along the front of the bed, are
                    intended for supplying water amongst the rubble, to keep the soil about the
                    roots constantly moistened.</p>
                <p>Pits and frames of various kinds are also frequently used for the cultivation of
                    cucumbers and melons, as well as hot beds covered by ordinary garden frames. In
                    these cases the first supply of heat is derived from the hot bed made up within
                    the pit (fig. 17, <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> which is all the better for having
                    a layer or two of faggot-wood worked into it to facilitate the distribution of
                    the heat from the linings later on. When the heat of the original bed subsides,
                    linings of fermenting dung <hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    must be added, and these must be kept active by occasional turnings and the
                    addition of fresh material as often as required. Figs. 16 and 17 show different
                    forms of pits of this character. It is, however, a vast improvement upon the old
                    system to effect both top and bottom heating by hot-water pipes (fig. 16, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a),</hi> in which case the width of the pits may be increased
                    by at least 2 feet. Where there is much forcing carried on, the judicious
                    arrangement of the several structures, permitting of their being worked from one
                    boiler, should be carefully seen to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Orchard Houses</hi> are the invention of the late Mr Rivers of
                    Sawbridgeworth. In all the more genial portions of England and Scotland they may
                    be used without fire-heat, and chiefly for potted fruit trees; and if the trees
                    are well managed, a very large quantity and variety of fruit can be produced, of
                    excellent if not first-rate quality. These houses will be found useful adjuncts
                    to other structures even in large gardens, while they are of the utmost value to
                    amateurs, who would otherwise be dependent on outdoor crops. They are, moreover,
                    exceedingly economical, and may be turned to a variety of uses, being just as
                    suitable for the growth of half-hardy flowers as for our less hardy fruits. For
                    fruit trees the orchard houses are of most value in spring, not to excite but to
                    protect the blossom buds, and in autumn to assist in ripening both fruit and
                    wood. While peaches, nectarines, and apricots are the permanent occupants of the
                    house, except in late autumn, when they may be set out of doors, plums, pears,
                    and apples may all by this means be assisted to produce good crops. During
                    winter and spring (when they should be kept cool) the trees may be stored as
                    closely as possible, and in this state they may remain until after blooming is
                    over and the fruits are set, when the hardier kinds should be gradually drawn
                    out and hardened in sheltered spots, and eventually plunged in the open garden
                    to swell their fruits, this thinning out affording room for the tenderer
                    kinds.</p>
                <p>The orchard house may be of the lean-to form or a span; but the latter is much to
                    be preferred. Fig. 18 is a ske÷ch of Mr Rivers’s small span-roofed orchard
                    house, which is built of wood and glass. Two rows, 14 feet apart, of oak posts
                    <hi rend="italic">a, a,</hi> δ by 3 inches and 9 feet long, or of deal posts set
                    in cast-iron sockets, are firmly fixed 3 feet in the ground and 5 feet apart. On
                    each of these should be firmly nailed the plate <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> 4
                    inches by 3, to receive the ends of the rafters c, c, which should be 8 feet
                    long and 3 inches by 1⅛. The ridge board <hi rend="italic">d</hi> should be 3
                    inches by 1, to which the upper ends of the rafters, after being sloped, should
                    be nailed. At the. lower end a drip board, 5 inches by 1, placed sloping to
                    receive the lower ends of the glass, must be fixed on the plate the full length
                    of the house; and on the ridge board a small ledge must be nailed for the upper
                    ends of the glass panes to rest upon. On the upper edge of the ridge board a
                    cap, 3 inches by 1, shaped thus A, should be nailed, to shoot off the water and
                    prevent its entrance at the ridge. The sides <hi rend="italic">i</hi> are
                    boarded, and the roof is of 21 oz. glass, the rafters</p>
                <p>(stout sash-bars) being 20 inches apart, and the panes 15 inches long, set end to
                    end in glazing. Under the glass <hi rend="italic">g</hi> on each side is a
                    ventilating shutter <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> f inch broad and 1 foot wide,
                    hinged and opening downwards. The roof is stay∣ d by irons screwed to every
                    fourth rafter. The angular space over the door forms a ventilator. A house of
                    this form should have a central path <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the two beds or
                    spaces on each side <hi rend="italic">f,f</hi> accommodating the fruit trees
                    either planted out or grown in pots. These beds may be raised above the path if
                    used for dwarf trees.</p>
                <p>As a larger house, one of 24 feet width (fig. 19) might be recommended. The oak
                    posts or deal posts in sockets, 6 inches by 4, must be set in two rows <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a,</hi> 24 feet asunder, 6 feet apart in the rows, and the
                    plates, rafters, ridge board, and drip board should be as described above. The
                    apex of the ridge <hi rend="italic">d</hi> should be 12 feet from the surface.
                    The roof itself c is supported and steadied by two rows of iron pillars <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> connected by tie rods, and glazed with 21 oz. glass, the
                    rafters being 20 inches apart. The sides and ends are boarded, and provided with
                    hinged ventilators as in the smaller house. The floor may be level with the
                    ground, and with a central path or two side paths <hi rend="italic">e, e.</hi>
                    For dwarfer and more bushy plants, and for general purposes, the beds may be
                    slightly raised, as/,/,/in fig. 19. When the trees are planted out the raised
                    beds would be objectionable as diminishing the available height, but for potted
                    plants they are an advantage, raising the trees nearer to the light.</p>
                <p>In the north of England, and in all moist and cold districts of Scotland or
                    Ireland, Mr Rivers recommends the introduction of a hot-water pipe or two into
                    houses in which peaches, nectarines, and apricots are to be grown, not to force
                    them, but to ensure the ripening of both wood and fruit.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Pits and Frames.—</hi> These are used both for the summer
                    growth and winter protection of various kinds of ornamental plants, for the
                    growth of such fruits as cucumbers, melons, and strawberries, and for the
                    forcing of vegetables. When heat is required, it is sometimes supplied by means
                    of fermenting dung, or dung and leaves, or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"

                    provided, on the score of labour at least, by hot-water pipes. Pits of many
                    different forms have been designed, but it may be sufficient here to describe
                    one or two which can be recommended for general purposes.</p>
                <p>Fig. 20 represents a simple and useful form of pit designed for the Chiswick
                    garden by Mr Sibthorpe, and published by Mr R. Thompson <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gardener's Assistant,</hi> 499). It is 7 feet wide, the front wall 2 feet
                    high, the back wall 3⅛ feet. The walls are one brick thick, or 4⅜ inches, with a
                    4-inch pier <hi rend="italic">a</hi> at every third rafter, the foundations
                    being respectively 9 and 14 inches. The wall plates both at front and back
                    project so as to allow the drip to fall clear of the walls; and fillets of wood
                    fixed to their under surfaces and close up to the wall on each side serve to
                    maintain both the wall plate and top of the wall steadily in their positions.
                    Such a pit used for cucumbers or melons might be excavated slightly below the
                    ground level to admit of bottom heat being supplied by a bed of fermenting dung,
                    over which the soil should be placed in the usual way, bringing the plants up
                    near to the glass; or the bottom heat might be supplied by the tank system of
                    heating or by hot-water pipes. For small store plants of any kind the interior
                    might be filled up with any porous materials, finishing off with a surface of
                    fine coal-ashes at a suitable height, or larger plants might be accommodated by
                    using it as shown, without any filling up. Heat can easily be supplied by one or
                    two 4-inch pipes, front and back, according to the temperature required; but if
                    fermenting material be used for this purpose, the lower portion of the walls, as
                    far up as will be covered by the interior filling, should be pigeon-holed.</p>
                <p>An excellent pit for wintering bedding-out plants or young greenhouse stock is
                    shown at fig. 21. It is built upon the pigeonhole principle as high as the
                    ground level <hi rend="italic">a, a,</hi> and above that in 9-inch brickwork. At
                    a distance of 9 inches retaining walls <hi rend="italic">b, b</hi> are built up
                    to the ground level, and the spaces between the two are covered by thick
                    boarding, which is to be shut down as shown at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in cold
                    weather to exclude frost, and opened as shown at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in
                    mild weather to promote a free circulation of air through the pit. The height of
                    the pit might· be reduced according to the size of the plants; and, to secure
                    the interior against frost, a flow and return hot-water pipe <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> should pass along beneath the staging, which should be a strong wooden
                    trellis supported by projections in the brickwork. The water which drains from
                    the plants or is spilt in watering would fall on the bottom, which should be
                    made porous to carry it away. For many plants this under current of ventilation
                    would be exceedingly beneficial, especially when cold winds prevented the sashes
                    from being opened. A pit of this character may be sunk into the ground deeper
                    than is indicated in the figure if the subsoil is dry and gravelly, but in the
                    case of a damp subsoil it should rather be more elevated, as the soil could
                    easily be sloped up to meet thé retaining wall.</p>
                <p>For all useful purposes these two forms of pits will suffice, but there will
                    always be found occupation for some of the common hotbed frames (fig. 22). They
                    should be made of the best red deal, 1∣ inch thick. A convenient size is 6 feet
                    wide, 24 inches high at the back and 15 in front; and they are usually 12 feet
                    long, which makes three lights and sashes, though they can be made with two
                    lights or one light for particular purposes. Indeed, a one-light frame (fig. 23)
                    is often found very convenient for many purposes. The lights should be 2 inches
                    thick, and glazed with 21 oz. sheet glass, in broad panes four or five to the
                    breadth of a light, and of a length which will work in conveniently and
                    economically, very long panes being undesirable from the havoc caused by
                    accidents, and very short ones being objectionable as multiplying the chances of
                    drip; panes of from 6 or 8 to 12 inches long are of convenient size for garden
                    lights of this character. In all gardens the frames and lights should be of one
                    size so as to be interchangeable, and a good supply of extra lights (sashes) may
                    always be turned to good account for various purposes.</p>
                <p>Boulton and Paul’s span-roof garden frame (fig. 24) may under some circumstances
                    be useful as a substitute for the three-light frame. It is adapted for storing
                    plants in winter, for nursing small plants in summer, and for the culture of
                    melons and other crops requiring glass shelter. These frames are made 11 inches
                    high in front, 22 at the back, and 32 at the ridge, with ends of l⅜-inch red
                    deal; the sashes, which are 2 inches thick, open by gearing, the front and back
                    separately. The lights are hinged so that they can be turned completely back
                    when necessary. This more direct and ready access to the plants within is one of
                    the principal recommendations of this form of pit.</p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Mushroom House.—</hi> Mushrooms may be grown in sheds and
                    cellars, or even in protected ridges in the open ground, but a special structure
                    is usually devoted to them. A lean-to against the north side of the garden wall
                    will be found suitable for the purpose, though a span-roofed form may also be
                    adopted, especially if the building stands apart.</p>
                <p>The internal arrangement of a lean-to mushroom house is shown in fig. 25. The
                    length may vary from 30 feet to 60 feet; a convenient width is 10 feet, which
                    admits of a 3⅜ feet central path, and beds 3 feet wide on each side. The shelves
                    should be of slate <hi rend="italic">a, a,</hi> supported by iron uprights <hi
                    rend="italic">b, b,</hi> each half having a front ledge of bricks set on edge in
                    cement . -</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c, c.</hi> The slabs of slate forming the shelves should not be
                    too closely fitted, as a small interval will prevent the accumulation of
                    moisture at the bottom of the bed. They may be supported <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n238/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0238-0227"/> by iron standards or brick piers, back and front,
                    bearing up a flat bar of iron on which the slates may rest; the use of the bar
                    will give wider intervals between the supports, which will be found convenient
                    for filling and emptying the beds. The roof may be tiled or slated; but, to
                    prevent the injurious influence of hot sun, there should be an inner roof or
                    ceiling <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the space between which and the outer roof <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> should be packed with sawdust. A hot-water pipe / should
                    run along both sides of the pathway, close to the front ledge of the lowest
                    beds. The different shelves can be planted in succession; and the lower ones,
                    especially those on the floor level, as being most convenient, can be utilized
                    for forcing sea-kale and rhubarb.</p>
                <p>Another style of house which answers remarkably well may be formed by an arch of
                    brickwork, making a kind of tunnel, or by a semi-arch projected against a brick
                    Wall or against the side of a bank (fig. 26). In either case the arch <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> should be covered with a thick bank of earth <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and planted with spreading shrubs to keep it cool and
                    shaded. The size of the beds and the fitting up may be exactly the same as in
                    fig. 25 already described, except that on one side the available height will be
                    necessarily less.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Fruit Room.—</hi> In many gardens a portion of the shed
                    accommodation behind the ranges of glass-houses is made to do service as a fruit
                    room, but it is sometimes difficult to secure in this way the conditions
                    favourable for the conservation of fruit. The main requisites are coolness and a
                    steady uniform temperature, combined with darkness and moderate but not
                    excessive dryness. A dry cool cellar makes an excellent fruit room.</p>
                <p>One of the most successful examples of a fruit room is that of Mr Moorman of
                    Clapham, described by Mr Robert Thompson in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the
                    Horticultural Society</hi> (vi. 110), of which figs. 27 and 28 represent a plan
                    and section. The building in this case was not specially erected for a fruit
                    room, having been originally a loft over a coach-house. The walls have an inner
                    lining of board enclosing a cavity, which is probably one cause of the
                    efficiency of the apartment, since the wood lining and the cavity containing air
                    both act as slow conductors of heat. The ceiling on the north side is double,
                    which also conduces to the same end. There is a swing window <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> opened a little occasionally, but always covered with a roller Wind so
                    as to shut out light, and there is a small stove c, but seldom used, and never
                    for the sake of warming the air, unless the temperature is below freezing; if
                    damp is observed a little fire is lighted on a dry day, and this with
                    ventilation soon dissi pates it. The fruit shelves <hi rend="italic">d,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> are made with battens 1⅛ inch wide and 1∣ inch apart, with
                    a layer of clean straw placed across them, and on this the fruit is laid out
                    singly. The shelves are enclosed by a partition of open work <hi rend="italic"
                    >e, e,</hi> which is made of battens similar to the shelves themselves.</p>
                <p>The fruit room in the Royal Horticultural Garden at Chiswick is a very good
                    example of one on a larger scale. The floor of this is sunk about 18 inches
                    below the ground level, and is concreted to keep out rats and mice. It is built
                    against a north wall, and has a low sloping roof of slate. Three or four ranges
                    of shelves are fixed all round against the walls, and there is a table occupying
                    the centre for the display of samples of the different kinds grown. Such an
                    apartment would form a convenient finit room in a private garden establishment.
                    The walls should be hollow; and a ventilator made to open and shut, and
                    communicating obliquely with the external air, should be inserted in the ceiling
                    near each end, the interval between ceiling and roof being packed with dry
                    sawdust to assist in keeping up a uniform temperature. The shelves should be
                    made of narrow battens of wood laid somewhat apart, as in Mr Moorman’s house,
                    and the central table should be fitted with shallow drawers in which to store
                    the very choicest fruits, such as the finer dessert pears, which should be
                    individually wrapped in tissue paper and laid in a single tier. The better kinds
                    of fruits on the open shelves should be laid out singly. It is a wise economy
                    not to stint space in such a structure, as many things can be accommodated for a
                    time in a room of this sort; for example, the floor space beneath the shelves
                    forms a good place for storing seed potatoes, especially those for the early
                    crops. A window is necessary, as light will be occasionally required to examine
                    and to select the fruits, but it should be tight-fitting, and on all other
                    occasions closed by shutters so as to keep the interior dark. The door should
                    also be closely fitted, to exclude the external air; indeed it is better if the
                    fruit room itself can be entered from an adjoining apartment, from which light
                    need not be excluded, and which may serve as a seed room and store room for many
                    of the smaller garden requisites. If a hot-water pipe can be run round these
                    apartments from some neighbouring apparatus, so much the better, but in the
                    fruit room proper it should only be used occasionally to dispel damp, or, in the
                    case of very severe weather, to keep out frost.</p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Heating Apparatus.—</hi> Plant houses are heated in a
                    variety of ways, but practically smoke flues and hot-water pipes are principally
                    made use of. The cost of erection is a little more for hot water pipes than for
                    flues, but the former are the cheaper in the end. Steam is not now used as a
                    heating medium, except where the waste steam of a manufactory is turned to
                    account in some adjoining garden. The use of fermenting vegetable substances in
                    the production of heat is rapidly disappearing from our best gardens before the
                    application of hot water, which is far more economical and certain in its
                    effects.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Smoke Flue,</hi> that is, the continuous cavity commencing
                    at the back of the furnace and ending at the chimney, whan used as <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0239-0228"/> a source of heat, should be carried along the
                    front of the house, returning near the back; by the time it has run thus far
                    most of the heat taken up from the fuel will be in course of transmission to the
                    enclosed atmosphere of the house to be heated. There should be a gradual rise
                    for some distance after leaving the furnace, which should be from 1 to 2 feet
                    below the level of the front flue; and there should be no sharp angles or
                    turnings. Earthenware pipes may be substituted when appearance is not a
                    consideration. Smoke flues should be cleaned out at least once a year. When
                    properly constructed, they answer their purpose sufficiently well; but this mode
                    of heating is now virtually superseded in all gardens of note by the hot-water
                    system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hot Water.—</hi> The diffusion of heat in plant houses by
                    causing hot water to circulate in iron pipes or vessels was brought into notice
                    in 1827, and has gradually superseded all other modes. The apparatus is more
                    durable than flues, occupies less space, can be placed in situations where flues
                    cannot, is more elegant in appearance, gives out a more steady and uniform heat,
                    and can seldom be overheated. The true cause of the circulation of the water in
                    the pipes may be explained by fig. 29. When the water in the boiler <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is heated up, it expands and so becomes lighter than that
                    in the cistern <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; the pressure at <hi rend="italic"
                    >z</hi> in the horizontal pipe <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is thus less than at <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> so that the water flows through <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> is kept supplied from the pipe <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> In this
                    arrangement, which represents the common tank boiler, with a cistern at the
                    extremity of the pipes, the process of heating was slow, and many changes have
                    consequently been made.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Furnace.—</hi> The most perfect furnace is that in which
                    the combustion is most complete. On this account the fire should be surrounded
                    by slow conductors of heat, such as Welsh lumps or other kinds of fire-brick;
                    and the sides of the furnace should not be formed by any part of the boiler, nor
                    should the furnace bars be tubular and connected with the boiler, though this
                    latter plan is sometimes adopted to prevent the burning out of the bars. All the
                    air necessary for maintaining combustion should enter from below, that is,
                    through the ash-pit, and not through the door or sides of the furnace; but to
                    produce this effect the furnace should be fitted with double doors and ash-pit
                    registers, for thus only can the stoker have control over his furnace. By
                    shutting the ashpit and furnace door closely combustion is lessened, and the
                    fire may be kept almost in a state of quiescence for many hours together; while,
                    on opening either the door or ash-pit register, air is admitted and combustion
                    goes on. Sylvester’s furnace doors or doors of similar sliding form (fig. 30)
                    are preferable to the ordinary hinged doors, because they can be opened to any
                    extent, and are less liable to get out of order. These doors are faced with
                    firebrick, and run on rollers on an iron rod, or slide by means of a ledge. JIr
                    Taplin recommended, in the <hi rend="italic">Florist and Pomologist</hi> (1868,
                    p.</p>
                <p>32), that, to prevent the burning away of the furnace bars and the formation of
                    clinkers, the ash-pit should be kept filled with water, and states that the bars
                    will then last three times as long as with the ordinary dry ash-pit. The ash-pit
                    may be built in cement for this purpose, or fitted with a cast-iron pan for the
                    water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hot-Water Boilers.—</hi> Only a few of the principal types of
                    the very diverse kinds of boilers can be noticed here. The simpler the form and
                    the less complicated the whole apparatus is the better. It is essential that a
                    large area of the boiler surface should be brought within the direct action of
                    the fire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rogers’s Conical Boiler</hi> (fig. 31), which has long been in
                    use, is very suitable for heating pits and small houses, since it is econo mical
                    of fuel, and gives out a steady heat for a long time—15 to 20 hours. It is
                    formed of two truncated concentric cones, with a space of 2 or 3 inches between
                    them for the water, the furnace being in the inner cone, and the fuel supplied
                    from the top. It was originally surrounded with brickwork, but several
                    improvements have been introduced. In fig. 31 the boiler is placed in a
                    cast-iron stand, with ground circular furnace, and register ash-pit doors,— <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> being the furnace, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the boiler, <hi

                    cleaning the furnace. The best kinds of fuel are coke, gas cinders, and
                    anthracite; but common coal which does not cake very much is also suitable, as
                    it is soon formed into coke.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Saddle Boilers.—</hi> The saddle boiler is a very efficient
                    form, steady and sure in its working. In its improved forms it is, perhaps, the
                    best for general purposes. It should be set over a furnace, the sides and end of
                    which should be of fire-brick. It may be quite plain, or with the inner surface
                    ribbed or corrugated (fig. 32), a modification adopted by Mr Gray of Chelsea. In
                    all saddle boilers, which should be deep from front to back, and set well back
                    from the doors of the furnace, the full force of the fire strikes the dome of
                    the boiler directly, and so long as the fire continues this Is the part most
                    directly influenced by its heat. The flow pipe is shown at <hi rend="italic"

                    boiler. The boiler is emptied by a small tap affixed to the pipe shown in the
                    front.</p>

                    Birmingham in 1872. The Witley Court boiler and the Glasgow boiler are both
                    excellent forms of the flued saddle type.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stevens s Trentham Boiler</hi> (fig. 39) is a very powerful and

                    substantially rivetted together, and having a water space of about 2 inches
                    between them. The frame for the furnace doors <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    attached to the front. It is supported by two cast-iron chairs <hi rend="italic"

                    above them forming the furnace, and that below them the ash-pit. The heat thus
                    passes through the centre of the cylinder, then returns by the upper flue over
                    its top, and is conducted to the chimney by the lower flue, which arrangement is
                    found to work better than when the heated air is made to pass through the lower
                    flue first.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tubular Boilers. —</hi> While the action of tubular boilers is
                    rapid, and they are undoubtedly very powerful, they are said to be prodigal in
                    their consumption of fuel, and liable to crack. In many cases, however, they
                    have done good work for many years, and they are consequently employed to a
                    considerable extent. The original tubular boilers were horizontal, but the
                    upright form has nearly superseded this, and the <hi rend="italic">Upright Oval
                    Tubular</hi> of Mr Gray, and the <hi rend="italic">Duplex Upright Tubular</hi>
                    of Messrs Weeks &amp; Co., both of Chelsea,—the latter marked by improvements
                    introduced specially to meet the foregoing objections,—are the best forms at
                    present in use. The Duplex (fig. 40) is made in two equal parts, each being
                    capable of being worked alone. Each section consists of a semicircle of upright
                    tubes forming the boiler proper, fitted with the diaphragm <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> by which more perfect combustion of the fuel is secured, a series of
                    horizontal pipes forming the furnace ∕, a flow pipe <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
                    a return pipe <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and an outlet <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    for removing sedimentary deposits from the interior.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ladds's Boiler</hi> (fig. 41) is a horizontal tubular, which is
                    found to be extremely powerful as well as economical. It is a rectangular box 6
                    feet long, made of 2-inch iron pipes, fixed into hollow water spaces which form
                    the ends; these pipes act as fire bars, and form the sides of the furnace. Above
                    the fire there are three series of horizontal pipes, each covered by a layer of
                    tiles so placed as to convert the two intervening spaces into flues, along which
                    the flames and smoke travel for 18 feet, the smoke escaping at the far end by an
                    opening in the upper layer of tiles. Each tier of pipes in its turn therefore
                    gets its share of heat from the burning fuel, and the consequence is that the
                    apparatus is very quick in its action. The tubes are fitted in with Portland
                    cement and hempen cord packing—tar ropes being found to destroy the cement.
                    These boilers each heat 3000 feet or more of 4-inch piping. On the top of the
                    upper layer of tiles are placed about 9 inches of ashes, then ordinary inch
                    boards which rest on 4⅛-inch retaining walls, and on these 8 or 10 inches more
                    of ashes, which very efficiently prevents any loss of heat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stoves, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> In the case of very small houses
                    petroleum stoves or lamps are sufficient to keep out all ordinary frosts, but
                    they are attended with a disagreeable smell. A small conical or cylindrical
                    boiler attached to a system of piping is by far the safest and best in such
                    cases. The furnace heating may also be effected either with petroleum, or,
                    better still, as requiring no attendance, with gas. The furnace should be
                    accessible from the outside only, so that none of the products of combustion may
                    enter the house. A small conservatory might be readily heated in this way from a
                    furnace fixed in a recess of the back wall or in the basement of the house, and
                    placed near one of the fire-places, so that the outlet may be conducted into the
                    chimney. A flow and return passing along under the side and front stage
                    (avoiding doorways) might be kept heated by means of a small boiler of any form
                    set over a circlet of gas jets. If on the level, the arrangement would be more
                    simple still, since the boiler could be set in the house without brickwork, and
                    the furnace constructed beneath it by piercing through the exterior wall, and
                    fitting the opening with an ordinary furnace door.</p>
                <p>Hot-water pipes are best made of cast-iron. Tow or rope, and a mixture of red and
                    white lead, are generally used for packing or caulking the joints, though some
                    prefer vulcanized india-rubber rings, which make good sound joints, and are very
                    easily removable; for the joints near the fire iron cement must, however, be
                    used. Flat pipes, and fluted or semi-circular pipes have sometimes been used,
                    but the cylindrical form is much to be preferred. The number of pipes must be
                    regulated by the extent to be heated, and the degree of temperature required; it
                    is often well to have three or even four flow pipes and only one return
                    pipe.</p>
                <p>Pipes of 4-inch bore are almost universally employed, but 3-inch pipes may often
                    be used in small houses. It is a mistake to stint the quantity of piping, since
                    it is far more economical and better for the plants to have a larger surface
                    heated moderately than a smaller surface heated to the highest possible degree.
                    The pipes should, moreover, be placed near the front or lowest part of the
                    house, and, to prevent loss of heat by conduction, should be supported clear of
                    the ground, not less than 6 inches, upon cast-iron chairs.</p>
                <p>Mr Cannell of Swanley has adopted the plan of fixing two or three distinct lines
                    of small piping close under the roof glass, so as to prevent the air near the
                    glass from getting cold. This contrivance is particularly useful in repelling
                    damp during winter; and it may also be adopted for warming pits intended for the
                    growth of half-hardy plants.</p>
                <p>Hot water may be beneficially applied to garden walls, not, however, for the
                    purpose of forcing the blossoms, but to assist in maturing late fruit and the
                    young wood in unpropitious seasons.</p>

                <p>To this end the walls must be built hollow, and the pipes placed near the bottom
                    of the cavity, and supported on cast-iron chairs placed on the top of the
                    foundation course of material. This method was first exemplified by Mr Atkinson
                    in the gardens of the duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey in 1828.</p>

                    introduced some years since by Mr W. E. Rendle. It consists in circulating hot
                    water in broad shallow tanks instead of closed pipes. It will be obvious that as
                    the water is to flow along these open (or only loosely covered) conduits, they
                    must themselves be level, and the boiler must be either at the same level or
                    below it, the connexion between the two being made in either case by hot-water
                    pipes of suitable length. The tanks are formed of wood, brick, stone, or
                    cast-iron. When of wood, they require to be made of good sound plank, not less
                    than 2 inches thick, and properly jointed, and they are usually covered with
                    slates. Stone or brick tanks require to be lined with a thick coating of Roman
                    cement, while stone, slate, or brick pavement may be employed for covers. The
                    cast-iron tanks have covers of the same material.</p>
                <p>When one tank only is employed, as for example in supplying bottom heat to the
                    front bed of a propagating pit, it should be Constructed with a division along
                    the centre, running to within about a foot of the end, which should be -left
                    open to allow of the water passing to the other side; the flow pipe from the
                    boiler should be connected with the end of the tank on one side of the central
                    division, and the return pipe for leading the water back to the boiler should be
                    connected at the same end on the other side of the division, a sufficient number
                    of pipes being also connected with the flow and return pipes to heat the
                    atmosphere to the temperature desired. It is convenient to have valves fixed in
                    the flow and return pipes, so as to shut off bottom or top heat as may be
                    required. In a larger house a tank may run along the front, across the end, and
                    along the back to the end whence it started; and this may be either divided
                    along the centre as in the former case, the water flowing the whole distance on
                    one side the division and returning on the other, or a broad tank may occupy the
                    front and back, and be connected at the end by an ordinary 4-inch pipe, the flow
                    from the boiler being united with the front tank, and the return carried from
                    the back tank into the boiler.</p>
                <p>The tank system of heating is perhaps one of the readiest modes of supplying
                    bottom heat to plunging beds either for propagating or for growing plants,
                    though the same end is practically attained by running some of the ordinary
                    4-inch pipes connected with the heating apparatus through a tank which can be
                    charged with water when necessary, and emptied when heat is not required. When
                    the plan is used for supplying both top and bottom heat, provision must be made
                    to prevent too much of the steam or vapour from passing into the house; and, on
                    account of the danger of having too much damp at certain seasons, it is perhaps
                    preferable to have a separate set of pipes for the supply of atmospheric
                    heat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Solar Heat.—</hi> The rays of the sun reflected from walls and
                    other surfaces become a source of artificial heat. This species of heat,
                    however, is materially affected by the admission of the air necessary to the
                    health of the plants. Solar heat, if properly regulated by ventilation, is of
                    immense importance in the ripening of all the finer fruits, as well as for the
                    abundant development of blossoms in the case of flowering plants. In the orchard
                    house, fruits are ripened by the influence of solar heat alone. To secure as
                    much solar heat during the day as possible, the ventilators should be opened
                    early in the morning, and closed early in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Ventilating Apparatus.—</hi> The object of ventilation is
                    not so much to aid the respiration of the plants as to carry off noxious vapours
                    and to regulate the moisture and temperature. The mechanical agitation both of
                    the atmosphere and of the foliage caused by a free circulation, provided it be
                    not too cold or too rudely admitted, has also a beneficial influence on the
                    health of the plants. All ventilation, observes Mr M <hi rend="superscript">
                    ζ</hi> Intosh <hi rend="italic">(Book of the Garden,</hi> i. 271), “is founded
                    upon the simple principle that cold air is heavier and has a tendency to sink
                    downwards, while hot air is light and rises to the top. At first sight it may
                    appear that, for the purpose of ventilating any building, it is only necessary
                    that holes should be made at the bottom of the apartment for the air to enter,
                    and other holes be placed in the upper part for the air to escape. Practically,
                    however, ventilation is far from being so simple an affair,” since currents of
                    air are very difficult to direct or control, to moderate, or even to regulate
                    with very great nicety. Too frequently air is given only during the day, and is
                    excluded at night, often with an increase of fire-heat. Judicious
                    horticulturists will reverse this, since plants require fresh air by night as
                    well as by day, and in all countries cool nights succeed even the hottest
                    days.</p>
                <p>The mode of ventilating plant houses formerly in use was by letting down the top
                    roof sashes; this was often supplemented by having the front or upright sashes
                    also made movable, and more or less widely opened either outwards or laterally
                    during the daytime. It is much more economical, however, and equally
                    efficacious, to have the roof sashes fixed, and the top ventilation effected by
                    means of a lantern in the case of a span-roofed house, or by horizontal
                    ventilators near the top of the back wall in a lean-to. The front ventilation
                    may be effected by openings in the front wall opposite the heating pipes, by
                    which means the cold air is warmed, which is the best plan in all houses where a
                    high temperature has to be maintained, and is especially necessary in
                    forcing-houses, on account of the risk of injury to the foliage from cold air;
                    or the front sashes may be made movable, which is better in temperate houses. In
                    the case of pits, where there are no front sashes provided, the ventilators are
                    sufficient for the purpose. The sliding down of one sash over the other, as once
                    generally and even now frequently practised, greatly augments the shade in
                    oblique sunshine, and is strongly objectionable on that account. The lantern
                    mode of construction obviates this, but in a lean-to, and even with span roofs,
                    it is better to have shorter movable sashes, hung so as to open by being
                    elevated at the lower edge instead of sliding one over the other. A very slight
                    elevation is sufficient for the egress of vitiated air.</p>
                <p>A successful plan of warming the fresh air, recommended many years ago by Mr T.
                    Moore <hi rend="italic">(Journ.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> i. 110), consists in passing the air after its
                    admission by front ventilators through a heated chamber separate from the tank
                    used as the heating medium, but admitting of communication with the tank chamber
                    if necessary for the purpose of supplying moisture. The warmed fresh air is then
                    led out in front of the tank, and carried forwards by the circulation up the
                    slope of the roof, descending near the back wall to the floor, whence it is
                    sucked into the heated chamber, mingling with the fresh air as it enters to
                    repeat the circuit. A ventilator in the back wall provides the means of egress
                    when this is required. Another plan, well adapted for forcing-houses, consists
                    in fixing from end to end, below the hot-water pipes used for heating the
                    structure, a zinc pipe of 6-inch or 8-inch diameter, and perforated with small
                    holes, one end of the tube passing through an outer wall, and being fitted with
                    a valve which can be wholly or partly closed at pleasure. Other means of
                    accomplishing the same end may be adopted to suit particular cases.</p>
                <p>In order to secure the circulation of the confined air during the night, and thus
                    to prevent an injurious rise of the temperature, and also to economize fuel, it
                    is of advantage where practicable to use shutters. These should consist of a
                    light frame, readily movable, and fitted so as to slide readily in grooves on a
                    skeleton roof; and they should be covered with asphalted felt, or strong brown
                    paper coated with tar, which is much used in Germany for covering purposes, and
                    is both durable and cheap. This should form a close outer covering, the
                    ventilators being set open at bottom and top.</p>
                <p>Formerly all ventilation had to be effected by the hand unaided, each sash being
                    opened or shut separately, a matter of some urgency on the sudden outburst of
                    sunshine. In all good ranges of glass, and in detached houses also, the work is
                    now effected by machinery, many ingenious combinations of which are in use for
                    this purpose.</p>
                <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Hygrometry.—</hi> For the healthy growth of plants, the
                    regulation of the moisture is as necessary as the regulation of the heat. A
                    considerable degree of moisture is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n243/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0243-0232"/> necessary in the cases of most plants cultivated
                    in a high temperature; but the amount varies of course in different cases, and
                    this presents one of the principal difficulties in the management of what is
                    called a mixed collection, whether of stove or greenhouse plants. In the case of
                    fruits, where a house is mostly devoted to one subject, whether grapes, peaches,
                    pines, or melons, the requisite conditions can be more readily secured. The
                    instrument with which the amount of moisture present in the atmosphere is
                    measured is the hygrometer. The two hygrometers most generally used are
                    Daniell’s and the dry and wet bulb, the former a more delicate instrument, best
                    adapted for scientific observations, the latter a simpler instrument, better
                    adapted for horticultural purposes, because requiring less delicate
                    manipulation. It consists of two thermometers mounted on one frame, the readings
                    of which when uncovered should correspond. One bulb is left uncovered, the other
                    is covered with muslin, and a few threads of cotton, with their other ends
                    immersed in water, keep it constantly moist. The temperature is lowered by the
                    evaporation from the moistened bulb, and the difference in the readings of the
                    two thermometers shows the degree of dryness. Mr Glaisher’s instructions, which
                    accompany the set of hygrometrical tables published by him, will be found of
                    great assistance by every one making use of this instrument.</p>

                <p>18. <hi rend="italic">Soils and Composts.—</hi> The principal soils used in
                    gardens, either alone, or mixed to form what are called composts, are—loam,
                    sand, peat, leaf-mould, and various mixtures and combinations of these made up
                    to suit the different subjects under cultivation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Loam</hi> is the staple soil for the gardener; it is not only
                    used extensively in the pure and simple state, but enters into most of the
                    composts prepared specially for his plants. For garden purposes loam should be
                    rather unctuous or soapy to the touch when moderately dry, not clinging nor
                    adhesive, and should readily crumble when a compressed handful is thrown on the
                    ground. If it clings together closely it is too heavy and requires amelioration
                    by the admixture of gritty material; if it has little or no cohesion when
                    squeezed tightly in the hand, it is too light, and needs to be improved by the
                    addition of heavier or clayey material. Sound friable loam cut one sod deep from
                    the surface of a pasture, and stacked up for twelve months in a heap or ridge,
                    is invaluable to the gardener. When employed for making vine borders, loam of a
                    somewhat heavier nature can be used with advantage, on account of the porous
                    materials which should accompany it. For stone fruits a calcareous loam is best;
                    indeed, for these subjects a rich calcareous loam used in a pure and simple
                    state cannot be surpassed. Somewhat heavy loams are best for potting pine
                    apples, for melons and strawberries, and may be used with the addition of
                    manures only; but for ornamental plants a loam of a somewhat freer texture is
                    preferable and more pleasant to work. Loam which contains much red matter (iron)
                    should be avoided.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sand</hi> is by itself of little value except for striking
                    cuttings, for which purpose fine clean sharp silver sand is the best; and a
                    somewhat coarser kind, if it is gritty, is to be preferred to the comminuted
                    sands which contain a large proportion of earthy matter. River sand and the
                    sharp grit washed up sometimes by the road side are excellent materials for
                    laying around choice bulbs at planting time to prevent contact with earth which
                    is perhaps manure-tainted. Sea sand may be advantageously used both for
                    propagating purposes and for mixing in composts. For the growth of pot plants
                    sand is an essential part of most composts, in order to give them the needful
                    porosity to carry off all excess of moisture from the roots. If the finer earthy
                    sands only are obtainable, they must be rendered sharper by washing away the
                    earthy particles. Washed sand is best for all plants like heaths, which need a
                    pure and lasting compost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peat</hi> soil is largely employed for the culture of American
                    plants, as rhododendrons, azaleas, heaths, &amp;c. In districts where heather
                    and gritty soil predominate, the peat soil is poor and unprofitable, but
                    selections from both the heathy and the richer peat soils, collected with
                    judgment, and stored in a dry part of the compost yard, are essential
                    ingredients in the cultivation of many choice pot plants, such as the Cape
                    heaths and many of the Australian plants. Most monocotyledons do well in peat,
                    even if they do not absolutely require it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leaf-mould</hi> is eminently suited for the growth of many
                    free-growing plants, especially when it has been mixed with stable manure and
                    has been subjected to fermentation for the formation of hot beds. In any state
                    most plants feed greedily upon it, and when pure or free from decaying wood or
                    sticks it is a very safe ingredient in composts; but it is so liable to generate
                    fungus, and the mycelium or spawn of certain fungi is so injurious to the roots
                    of trees, attacking them if at all sickly or weakened by drought, that many
                    cultivators prefer not to mix leaf-mould with the soil used for permanent
                    plants, as peaches or choice ornamental trees. For quick growing plants,
                    however, as for example most annuals cultivated in pots, such as balsams,
                    cockscombs, globe-amaranths, and the like, for cucumbers, and for young
                    soft-wooded plants generally, it is exceedingly useful, both by preventing the
                    consolidation of the soil and as a manure. The accumulations of light earth
                    formed on the surface in woods where the leaves fall and decay annually are
                    leafmould of the finest quality.</p>
                <p>The material known as cocoa-nut fibre refuse is analogous to leaf soil, and may
                    be employed for similar purposes. It should be mixed with gritty matter to
                    favour the passage of water, and indeed requires to be so mixed when in an
                    advanced stage of decay, in order to prevent its collapse into a close pasty
                    mass. This cocoa-nut refuse is also a useful light material into which to plunge
                    pots containing plants, as a preservative of the roots from the drying effects
                    of the sun or the chilling effects of frost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Composts</hi> are mixtures of the foregoing ingredients in
                    varying proportions, and in combination with manures if necessary, so as to suit
                    particular plants or classes of plants. The chief point to be borne in mind in
                    making these mixtures is not to combine in the same compost any bodies that are
                    antagonistic in their nature, as for example lime and ammonia. In making up
                    composts for pot plants, the fibrous portion should not be removed by sifting,
                    except for small sized pots, but the turfy portions should be broken up by hand
                    and distributed in smaller or larger lumps throughout the mass. When sifting is
                    had recourse to, the fibrous matter should be rubbed through the meshes of the
                    sieve along with the earthy particles. Before being used the turfy ingredients
                    of composts should lie together in a heap only long enough for the roots of the
                    herbage to die, not to decompose.</p>

                    cattle thrown together, and more or less soaked with liquid drainings of the
                    stable or byre. It is no doubt the finest stimulant for the growth of plants,
                    and that most adapted to restore the fertile elements which the plants have
                    abstracted from exhausted soils. This manure is best fitted for garden use when
                    in a moderately fermented state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Horse dung</hi> is generally the principal ingredient in all
                    hot bed manure; and, in its partially decomposed state, as afforded by exhausted
                    hot beds, it is well adapted for garden use. It is most <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0244-0233"/> beneficial on cold stiff soils. It should not be
                    allowed to lie too long unmoved when fresh, as it will then heat violently, and
                    the ammonia is thus driven off. To avoid this, it should be turned over two or
                    three times if practicable, and well moistened—preferably with farm-yard
                    drainings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cow dung</hi> is less fertilizing than horse dung, but being
                    slower in its action it is more durable; it is also cooler, and therefore better
                    for hot dry soils. Thoroughly decayed, it is one of the best of all manures for
                    mixing in composts for florists’ flowersand other choice plants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pig dung</hi> is very powerful, containing more nitrogen than
                    horse dung; it is therefore desirable that it should undergo moderate
                    fermentation, which will be secured by mixing it with litter and a portion of
                    earth. When weeds are thrown to the pigs, this fermentation becomes specially
                    desirable to kill their seeds. The drainings of a pig-stye form a most valuable
                    liquid manure for vegetable crops.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Night-soil</hi> is an excellent manure for all bulky crops, but
                    requires to be mixed with earth or peat, or coal-ashes, so as both to deodorize
                    it and to ensure its being equally distributed. Quick lime should not be used,
                    as it dispels the greater part of the ammonia. When prepared by drying and
                    mixing with various substances, night-soil is sold as poudrette, or desiccated
                    night-soil, the value of which depends upon the materials used for
                    admixture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Malt-dust</hi> is an active manure frequently used as a
                    top-dressing, especially for fruit trees in pots. It is rapid in its action, but
                    its effects are not very permanent. <hi rend="italic">Rape dust</hi> is somewhat
                    similar in its character and action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bones</hi> are employed as a manure with decided advantage both
                    to vegetable crops and to fruit trees, as well as to flowers. For turnips bone
                    manure is invaluable. The effects of bones are no doubt mainly due to the
                    phosphates they contain, and they are most effectual on dry soils. They are most
                    quickly available when dissolved in sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Guano</hi> is a valuable manure now much employed, and may be
                    applied to almost every kind of crop λvith decided advantage. It should be mixed
                    with six or eight times its weight of loam or ashes, charred peat,
                    charcoal-dust, or some earthy matter, before it is applied to the soil, as from
                    its causticity it is otherwise not unlikely to kill or injure the plants to
                    which it is administered.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pigeon dung</hi> approaches guano in its power as manure. It
                    should be laid up in ridges of good loamy soil in alternate layers to form a
                    compost, which becomes a valuable stimulant for any very choice subjects if
                    cautiously used. The dung of the domestic fowl is very similar in character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Horn, hoof-parings, woollen rags, fish, blubber,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">blood</hi> are all good manures, and should be utilized if readily
                    obtainable. <hi rend="italic">Sawdust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tan</hi> are of
                    less value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Liquid manure,</hi> consisting of the drainings of dung-heaps,
                    stables, cowsheds, &amp;c., or of urine collected from dwelling houses or other
                    sources, is a most valuable and powerful stimulant, and can be readily applied
                    to the roots of growing plants. The urine should be allowed to putrefy; as in
                    its decomposition a large amount of ammonia is formed, which should then be
                    fixed by sulphuric acid or gypsum; or it may be applied to the growing crops
                    after being freely diluted with water or absorbed in a compost heap. Liquid
                    manures can be readily made from most of the solid manures when required, simply
                    by admixture with water. When thus artificially compounded, unless for immediate
                    use, they should be made strong for convenience of storage, and applied as
                    required much diluted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ammonia</hi> is the most powerful of the manures of the
                    inorganic series, and one of the most important of the constituents of manures
                    generally, since it is the chief source whence plants derive their nitrogen. It
                    is largely supplied in all the most fertilizing of organic manures, but when
                    required in the inorganic state must be obtained from some of the salts of
                    ammonia, as the sulphate, the muriate, or the phosphate, all of which, being
                    extremely energetic, require to be used with great caution. These salts of
                    ammonia may be used at the rate of from 2 to 3 cwt. per acre as a top-dressing
                    in moist weather. When dissolved in water they form active liquid manures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Potash</hi> and <hi rend="italic">soda</hi> are also valuable
                    inorganic manures in the form of carbonates, sulphates, silicates, and
                    phosphates, but the most extensively employed is the nitrate of potash. The
                    manures of this class are of course of value only in cases where the soil is
                    naturally deficient in them. On this account the salts of soda are of less
                    importance than those of potash. The value of wood ashes as a manure very much
                    depends upon the carbonate and other salts of potash which they contain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lime</hi> in the caustic state is beneficially applied to soils
                    which contain an excess of inert vegetable matter, and hence may be used for the
                    improvement of old garden soils saturated with humus, or of peaty soils not
                    thoroughly reclaimed. It does not supply the place of organic manures, but only
                    renders that which is present available for the nourishment of the plants. It
                    also improves the texture of clay soils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gypsum,</hi> or sulphate of lime, applied as a top-dressing at
                    the rate of 2 to 3 cwt. per acre, has been found to yield good results,
                    especially on light soils. It is also employed in the case of liquid manures to
                    fix the ammonia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Burnt clay</hi> has a very beneficial effect on clay land by
                    improving its texture and rendering soluble the alkaline substances it contains.
                    The clay should be only slightly burnt, so as to make it crumble down readily;
                    in fact, the fire should not be allowed to break through, but should be
                    constantly repressed by the addition of material. The burning should be effected
                    when the soil is dry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable refuse</hi> of all kinds, when smother-burned in a
                    similar way, becomes a valuable mechanical improver of the soil; but the
                    preferable course is to decompose it in a heap with quick lime and layers of
                    earth, converting it into leaf-mould.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soot</hi> forms a good top-dressing; it consists principally of
                    charcoal, but contains ammonia, whence its value as a manure is derived. It
                    should be kept dry until required for use. It may also be used beneficially in
                    preventing the attacks of insects, such as the onion gnat and turnip fly, by
                    dusting the plants or dressing the ground with it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Common salt</hi> acts as a manure when used in moderate
                    quantities, but in strong doses is injurious to vegetation. It suits many of the
                    esculent crops, as onions, beans, cabbages, carrots, beet-root, asparagus,
                    &amp;c.; the quantity applied varies from 5 to 10 bushels per acre. It is used
                    as a top-dressing sown by the hand. Hyacinths and other bulbs derive benefit
                    from slight doses, while to asparagus as much as 20 It&gt; to the rood has been
                    used with beneficial effect. At the rate of from 6 to 10 bushels to the acre it
                    may be used on garden lawns to prevent worm casts. For the destruction of weeds
                    on gravel walks or in paved yards a strong dose of salt, applied either dry or
                    in solution, is found very effective, especially a hot solution, but after a
                    time much of it becomes washed down, and the residue acts as a manure; its
                    continued application is undesirable, as gravel so treated becomes pasty.</p>
                <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Tools, Implements, fee.</hi> — With regard to garden tools,
                    instruments, implements, and machinery, it is only some of the more modern
                    inventions and improvements that can be touched on here. The two indispensable
                    tools are the spade and the knife. The spade is commonly used for digging and
                    trenching, but much of this work is now better done by means of Parkes’s
                    digging-fork (fig. 42), which is both handier and lighter, and breaks up the
                    ground better than the spade. The pickfork or Canterbury hoe (fig. 43) is a very
                    useful tool for breaking up the surface soil, the threepronged end being used
                    for the looser parts, and the mattock end for breaking clods, or when the
                    surface has become much consolidated. The drag (fig. 44) is also useful—a light
                    three-pronged tool, which may be used for loosening the soil amongst vegetable
                    crops as well as flower garden plants, and may also be sometimes employed, if
                    the tines are sufficiently narrow and pointed, to drag off weeds from the
                    surface. The hand-fork (fig. 45), a shorthandled three-tined implement, is
                    extremely handy for many purposes, such as loosening weeds for hand-weeding, or
                    for planting or transplanting small subjects; it is also very handy for plunging
                    pots, either indoors or out, in tan-beds<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0245-0234"/>, ash-beds, or common soil. Hoes and rakes made
                    with a tapered neck and socket, into which the handle is fitted, do not clog so
                    readily as when they are driven into a ferruled handle.</p>
                <p>For pruning purposes a variety of instruments have been invented, under the names
                    of sécateurs, pruning-shears, pruning-scissors, &lt;fcc., but nothing equals a
                    well-tempered old-fashioned knife, varied in form, strength, and size to suit
                    the particular object to be operated on. The averruncator is a useful instrument
                    for cutting branches at a considerable elevation (12 to 15 feet) from the
                    ground. Selby’s flower gatherer (fig. 46), which cuts and holds the flower at
                    the same time, may be recommended, especially for the use of ladies. Some of the
                    fruit gatherers also are ingenious and useful. A new instrument for clipping
                    hedges, Ridgway’s hedge-cutter (fig. 47), does its work quickly and well; and
                    the same can be said for Adie’s new lawn-edging machine.</p>
                <p>For the destruction of insects Dean’s and Appleby’s and Dreschler’s fumigators
                    are all useful, but an equally efficient plan is to put a few live embers in a
                    flower-pot, raised on two bricks so placed as not to close the hole at the
                    bottom; on these embers moistened tobacco or tobacco paper is to be put, and
                    over all damped moss. This will burn slowly and fill the house with smoke, care
                    being taken that the material, as it dries, is lightly sprinkled with water, so
                    that it does not burst into a flame.</p>
                <p>Sulphurators are instruments for distributing flowers of sulphur, for the purpose
                    of destroying mildew. In the case of greenhouse plants, such as heaths, simply
                    dusting with sulphur through a muslin bag or dredger is sufficient; but in cases
                    where vines are attacked with the <hi rend="italic">Oidium</hi> or vine-mildew,
                    the saving of the crop depends on the prompt diffusion of sulphur over all the
                    affected parts, and this could not be so readily done by any other contrivance
                    as by some one of the various forms of sulphurator (figs. 48, 49).</p>
                <p>For the distribution of water in the form of spray, syringes are used, and of
                    these there are none better than</p>
                <p>Read’s patent, which acts by a piston and ball valve; while for the more powerful
                    garden engines, those manufactured by Read (fig. 50) and Warner have the
                    preference.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tallies</hi> of wood should be slightly smeared with white
                    paint and then written on while damp with a black-lead pencil. To preserve them
                    from decay they should first be soaked in linseed oil. Zinc tallies are the
                    best, on account of their durability, if written upon with a proper ink,—12
                    grains of bichloride of platinum dissolved in 1 oz. of distilled water. Larger
                    labels of various materials and patterns are provided for trees and shrubs, and
                    other permanent outdoor plants. Lead labels with stamped figures are very
                    useful. For numbering pot plants, these may be wedge-shaped and bent over close
                    to the pot-rim; for collections of plants they should be small and light, so
                    that the suspending wire may not cut into the bark of the plants. Zinc labels
                    with the names shown in relief are to be recommended when they can be obtained
                    ready made, but are too expensive when they have to be specially prepared.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Garden Operations.</hi></p>
                <p>21. <hi rend="italic">Propagation.—</hi> The increase of plants, so far as the
                    production of new individuals of particular kinds is concerned, is one of the
                    most important and constantly recurring of gardening operations. In effecting
                    this, various processes are adopted, which will now be described.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">B↑) Seeds.—</hi> This may be called the natural means of
                    increasing the number of any particular kind of plant, but it is to be
                    remembered that we do not by that means secure an exact reproduction of the
                    parent. We may get a progeny very closely resembling it, yet each plant
                    possessing a distinct individuality of its own; or we may get a progeny very
                    unlike the parent, or a mixed progeny showing various degrees of divergence.
                    Many seeds will grow freely if sown in a partially ripened state; but as a
                    general rule seeds have to be kept for some weeks or months in store, and hence
                    they should be thoroughly ripened before being gathered. They should be sown in
                    fine rich soil, and such as will not readily get consolidated. In the case of
                    outdoor crops, if the soil is inclined <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be heavy, it is
                    a good plan to cover all the smaller seeds with a light compost. Very small
                    seeds should only have a sprinkling of light earth or of sand, and sometimes
                    only a thin layer of soft moss to exclude light and preserve an equable degree
                    of moisture. Somewhat larger seeds sown indoors may be covered to the depth of
                    one-eighth or one-fourth of an inch, according to their size. Outdoor crops
                    require to be sown, the smaller seeds from half an inch to an inch, and the
                    larger ones from 2 to 4 inches <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0246-0235"/> under the surface, the covering of the smaller
                    ones especially being light and open. Many seeds grow well when raked in; that
                    is, the surface on which they are scattered is raked backwards and forwards
                    until most of them are covered. Whatever the seeds, the ground should be made
                    tolerably firm both beneath and above them; this may be done by treading in the
                    case of most kitchen garden crops, which are also better sown in drills, this
                    admitting the more readily of the ground being kept clear from weeds by hoeing.
                    All seeds require a certain degree of heat to induce germination. F or tropical
                    plants the heat of a propagating house—75° to 80°, with a bottom heat of 80° to
                    90°—is desirable, and in many cases absolutely necessary; for others, such as
                    half-hardy annuals, a mild hot bed, or a temperate pit ranging from 60° to 70°,
                    is convenient; while of course all outdoor crops have to submit to the natural
                    temperature of the season. It is very important that seeds should be sown when
                    the ground is in a good working condition, and not clammy with moisture.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">By Offsets.—</hi> This mode of increase applies speciali y
                    to bulbous plants, such as the lily and hyacinth, which produce little bulbs on
                    the exterior round their base. Most bulbs do so naturally to a limited but
                    variable extent; when more rapid increase is wanted the heart is destroyed, and
                    this induces the formation of a larger number of offsets. The stem bulbs of
                    lilies are similar in character to the offsets from the parent bulb. The same
                    mode of increase occurs in the gladiolus and crocus, but their bulb-like
                    permanent parts are called corms, not bulbs. After they have ripened in
                    connexion with the parent bulb, the offsets are taken off, stored in appropriate
                    places, and at the proper season planted out in nursery beds.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">By Tubers.—</hi> The tuber is a fleshy underground stem,
                    furnished with eyes which are either visible, as in the potato and in some
                    familiar kinds of <hi rend="italic">Tropoeolum</hi><hi rend="italic">( T.

                    vol. iv. p. 98. When used for propagation, the tubers are cut up into what are
                    called “sets,” every portion having an eye attached being capable of forming an
                    independent plant. The cut portions of bulky sets should be suffered to lie a
                    short time before being planted, in order to dry the surface and prevent
                    rotting; this should not, however, be done with such tropical subjects as
                    caladiums, the tubers of which are often cut up into very small fragments for
                    propagation, and of course require to be manipulated in a properly heated
                    propagating pit. No eyes are visible in the Chinese yam, but slices of the long
                    club-shaped tubers will push out young shoots and form independent plants, if
                    planted with ordinary care.</p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">By Division. —</hi> Division, or partition, is usually
                    resorted to in the case of tufted growing plants, chiefly perennial herbs; they
                    may be evergreen, as chamomile or thrift, or when dormant may consist only of
                    underground crowns, as larkspur or lily-of-.the-valley; but in either case the
                    old tufted plant being dug up may be divided into separate pieces, each
                    furnished with roots, and, when replanted, generally starting on its own account
                    without much check. Suffruticose plants and even small shrubs may be propagated
                    in this way, by first planting them deeper than they are ordinarily grown, and
                    then after the lapse of a year, which time they require to get rooted, taking
                    them up again and dividing them into parts or separate plants. Box-edgmg and
                    southernwood are examples. The same ends may sometimes be effected by merely
                    working fine soil in amongst the base of the stems, and giving them time to
                    throw out roots before parting them.</p>
                <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">By Stickers.—</hi> Root suckers are young shoots from the
                    roots of plants, chiefly woody plants, as may often be seen in the case of the
                    elm and the plum. The shoots when used for propagation must be transplanted with
                    all the roots attached to them, care being taken not to injure the parent plant.
                    If they spring from a thick root it is not to be wantonly severed, but the soil
                    should be removed and the sucker taken off by cutting away a clean slice of the
                    root, which will then heal and sustain no harm. Stem suckers are such as proceed
                    from the base of the stem, as is often seen in the case of the currant and
                    lilac. They should be removed in any case; when required for propagation they
                    should be taken with all the roots attached to them, and they should be as
                    thoroughly disbudded below ground as possible, or they are liable to continue
                    the habit of suckering. In this case, too, the soil should be carefully opened
                    and the shoots removed with a suckering iron, a sharp concave implement with
                    long iron handle (fig. 51). When the number of roots is limited, the tops should
                    be shortened, and some care in watering and mulching should be bestowed on the
                    plant if it is of value.</p>
                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">By Runners.—</hi> A definition of runners will be found in
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. p. 97. The young string-like shoots
                    produced by the strawberry are a well-known example of them. The process of
                    rooting these runners should be facilitated by fixing them close down to the
                    soil, which is done by small wooden hooked pegs or by stones; hair-pins, short
                    lengths of bent wire, &amp;c., may also be used. After the roots are formed, the
                    strings are cut through, and the runners become independent plants.</p>
                <p>(7) <hi rend="italic">By Proliferous Buds.—</hi> Not unlike the runner, though
                    growing in a very different way, are the bud-plants formed on the fronds of
                    several kinds of ferns belonging to the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asplénium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Woodwardia, Polystichum, Lastrea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Adiantum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cystopteris,</hi> &amp;c. In some

                    rend="italic">Polystichum lepidocaulon)</hi> the rachis of the frond is
                    lengthened out much like the string of the strawberry runner, and bears a plant
                    at its apex. In others <hi rend="italic">{Polystichum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >angulare</hi><hi rend="italic">proliferum),</hi> the stipes below and the
                    rachis amongst the pinnae develop buds, which are often numerous and crowded. In
                    others again (<hi rend="italic">Woodτoardia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >orientalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Asplénium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bulbiferum),</hi> buds are numerously produced on the upper surface of the
                    fronds. These will develop on the plant if allowed to remain. For propagation
                    the bulbiferous portion is pegged down on the surface of a pot of suitable soil;
                    if kept close in a moist atmosphere, the little buds will soon strike root and
                    form independent plants. In the <hi rend="italic">Cystopteris</hi> the buds are
                    deciduous, falling off as the fronds acquire maturity, but, if collected and
                    pressed into the surface of a pot of soil and kept close, they will grow up into
                    young plants the following season.</p>
                <p>(8) <hi rend="italic">By Layers.—</hi> Layering consists in preparing the branch
                    of a plant while still attached to the parent, bending it so that the part
                    operated on is brought under ground, and then fixing it there by means of a
                    forked peg. Some plants root so freely that they need only pegging down; but in
                    most cases the arrest of the returning sap to form a callus, and ultimately
                    young roots, must be brought about artificially, either by twisting the branch,
                    by splitting it, by girding it closely with wire, by taking off a ring of bark,
                    or by “tonguing.” In tonguing the leaves are cut off the portion which has to be
                    brought under ground, and a tongue or slit is then cut from below upwards close
                    beyond a joint, of such length that, when the cut part of the layer is pegged an
                    inch or two (or in larger woody subjects 3 or 4 inches) below the surface, the
                    elevation of the point of the shoot to an upright position may open the
                    incision, and thus set it free, so that it may be surrounded by earth to induce
                    it to form roots. The whole branch, except a few buds at the extremity, is
                    covered with soil. The best seasons for these operations are early spring and
                    midsummer, that is, before the sap begins to flow, and after the first flush of
                    growth has passed off. One whole summer, sometimes two, must elapse before the
                    layers will be fully rooted in the case of woody plants; but sι¼dι plants as
                    carnations and picotees, which are usually propagated in this way, in favourable
                    seasons take only a few weeks to root, as they are layered towards the end of
                    the bl∣ oming season in July, and are taken off and planted separately early in
                    the autumn. Fig. 52 shows a woody plant with one layer prepared by tonguing and
                    another by ringing.</p>
                <p>In general, each shoot makes one layer, but in plants like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wistaria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Clematis,</hi> which make long shoots, what
                    is called serpentine layering may be adopted; that is, the shoot is taken
                    alternately below and above the surface, as frequently as its length permits.
                    There must, however, be a joint at the underground part where it is to be
                    tongued and pegged, and at least one sound bud in each exposed part, from which
                    a shoot may be developed to form the top of the young plant.</p>
                <p>(9) <hi rend="italic">By</hi><hi rend="italic">Circum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >position.—</hi> When a plant is too high or its habit does not conveniently
                    admit of its being layered, it may often be increased by what is called
                    circumposition, the soil being carried up to the branch operated on. The branch
                    is to be prepared by ringing or notching or wiring as in layering, and a
                    temporary stand made to support the vessel which is to contain the soil. The
                    vessel may be a flower-pot sawn in two, so that the halves may be bound together
                    when used, or it may be a flower-pot or box with a side slit which will admit
                    the shoot; this vessel is to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n247/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0247-0236"/> filled, compactly with suitable porous earth, the
                    opening at the slit being stopped by pieces of slate or tile. The earth must be
                    kept moist, which is perhaps best done by a thick mulching of moss, the moss
                    being also bound closely over the openings in the vessel, and all being kept
                    damp by frequent syringings. Reid remarks of this method of propagation that he
                    has effected it with clay and cow dung, well mixed, after the bark had been
                    taken off all round, and wrapped about with a double or triple swaddling of
                    straw or hay ropes <hi rend="italic">(Scots Gardener,</hi> 1721).</p>
                <p>This process is sometimes found very useful in the case of choice conservatory
                    plants which may be getting too tall for the house, such as a fine <hi
                    rend="italic">Dracaena</hi> (fig. 53) or <hi rend="italic">Yucca.</hi> Such a
                    plant may be operated oh wherever the stem has become firm and woody; the top
                    will not fail to make a fine young specimen plant, which might be removed in the
                    course of about twelve months, while other shoots would no doubt be obtained
                    from the old stem, which, with its head thus reduced, might be removed to
                    quarters where it would not be an eyesore. The head would perhaps require
                    steadying if the stem were loaded with a pot or box of soil, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in the figure. Mr Bain records <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Faxt.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mag. Bot.,</hi> xvi. 46) a successful experiment
                    of this kind with a <hi rend="italic">Dracaena</hi><hi rend="italic">Draco</hi>
                    which was getting too tall for its position. An incision was made in the stem
                    half an inch deep to the extent of half its circumference, lime being applied to
                    the wound to dry up the sap. This incision was from time to time deepened (and
                    lime-dried) until severed, the top being suspended from the roof. After some
                    months roots were protruded from between the woody structure and its bush-like
                    covering, and the gigantic cutting was lowered into its place, and grew away
                    freely. In this case Mr Bain was of opinion that success was due to the slowness
                    of the process and the precautions taken to dry and harden the stem.</p>
                <p>(10) <hi rend="italic">By Grafts.—</hi> Grafting is so extensively resorted to
                    that it is impossible here to notice all its phases. It is perhaps of most
                    importance as the principal means of propagating our hardy kinds of fruit,
                    especially the apple and the pear; but the process is the same with most other
                    fruits and ornamental hardy trees and shrubs that are thus propagated. The
                    stocks are commonly divided into two classes :—(1) free stocks, which consist of
                    seedling plants, chiefly of the same genus or species as the trees from which
                    the scions are taken; and (2) dwarfing stocks, which are of more diminutive
                    growth, either varieties of the same species or species of the same or some
                    allied genus as the scion, which have a tendency to lessen the expansion of the
                    engrafted tree. The French Paradise is the best dwarfing stock for apples, and
                    the quince for pears. In determining the choice of stocks, the nature of the
                    soil in which the grafted trees are to grow should have full weight. In a soil,
                    for example, naturally moist, it is proper to graft pears on the quince, because
                    this plant not only thrives in such a soil, but serves to check the luxuriance
                    thereby produced. The scions should always be portions of the wood of the
                    preceding year, selected from healthy parents; in the case of shy-bearing kinds,
                    it is better to obtain them from the fruitful branches. The scions should be
                    taken off some weeks before they are wanted, and halfburied in the earth, since
                    the stock at the time of grafting should in point of vegetation be somewhat in
                    advance of the graft. During winter, grafts may be conveyed long distances, if
                    carefully packed. If they have been six weeks or two months separated from the
                    parent plant, they should be grafted low on the stock, and the earth should be
                    ridged up round them, leaving only one bud of the scion exposed above ground.
                    The best season for grafting apples and similar hardy subjects is the month of
                    March; but it may be commenced as soon as the sap in the stock is fairly in
                    motion, and may be continued during the first half of April.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Whip-grafting or Tongue-grafting</hi> (fig. 54) is the most
                    usual mode of performing the operation. The stock is headed off by an oblique
                    transverse cut as shown at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> a slice is then pared off
                    the side as at 5, and on the face of this a tongue or notch is made, the cut
                    being in a downward direction; the scion c is pared off in a similar way by a
                    single clean sharp cut, and this is notched or tongued in the opposite direction
                    as the figure indicates; the two are then fitted together as shown at <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> so that the inner bark of each may come in contact at
                    least on one side, and then tied round with damp soft bast as at e; next some
                    grafting clay is taken on the forefinger and pushed down on each side so as to
                    fill out the space between the top of the stock and the graft, and a portion is
                    also rubbed over the ligatures on the side where the graft is placed, a handful
                    of the clay is then taken, flattened out, and rolled closely round the whole
                    point of junction, being finished off to a tapering form both above and below,
                    as shown by the dotted line <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> To do this deftly, the
                    hands should be plunged from time to time in dry ashes, to prevent the clay from
                    sticking to them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cleft-grafting</hi> (fig. 55) is another method in common use.
                    The stock <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is cleft down from the horizontal cut <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> and the scion, when cut to a thin wedge form, as shown at
                    c and c, is inserted into the cleft; the whole is then bound up and clayed as in
                    the former case. This is not so good a plan as whip-grafting; it is improved by
                    sloping the stock on one side to the size of the graft.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crown-grafting</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bind-grafting</hi>
                    (fig. 56) is preferable to cleftgrafting, inasmuch as it leaves no open spaces
                    in the wood. The stock <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is cut off horizontally or
                    nearly so, and a slit is then cut in the bark <hi rend="italic">f, f,</hi> a
                    wedge-shaped piece of ivory being inserted to raise the bark; the scion is then
                    cut to the same, wedge-shaped form <hi rend="italic">g, h,</hi> and inserted in
                    the space opened for it between the albumen and the bark, after which it is tied
                    down and clayed over in the manner already described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Side-grafting</hi> is performed like whip-grafting, the graft
                    being inserted on the side of a branch and not at the cut end of the stock. It
                    may be practised for the purpose of changing a part of the tree, and is
                    sometimes very useful for filling out vacant spaces, in trained trees
                    especially.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inarching</hi> is another form of side-grafting. Here the graft
                    is fixed to the side of the stock, which is planted or potted close to the plant
                    to be worked. The branches are applied to the stock while yet attached to the
                    parent tree, and remain so until united. In the case of trained trees, a young
                    shoot is sometimes inarched to its parent stem to supply a branch where one has
                    not been developed in the ordinary way.</p>
                <p>For the propagation by grafts of stove and greenhouse plants the process adopted
                    is whip-grafting or a modification of it. The parts <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0248-0237"/> are, however, sometimes so small that the. tongue
                    of the graft is dispensed with, and the two stems simply pared smooth and bound
                    together. In this way hardy rhododendrons of choice sorts, greenhouse azaleas,
                    the varieties of the orange family, camellias, roses, rare conifers, and
                    numerous other plants are increased. In small subjects soft cotton is used for
                    tying instead of bast, and graftingwax is substituted for grafting-clay. The
                    best is the French cold mastic “L’Homme Lefort.” All grafting of this kind is
                    done in the propagating house, at any season when grafts are obtainable in a fit
                    state,—the plants when operated on being placed in close frames warmed to a
                    suitable temperature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Root-grafting</hi> is sometimes resorted to where extensive
                    increase is an object, or where stem-grafting or other means of propagation are
                    n t available. In this case the scion is grafted directly on to a portion of the
                    root of some appropriate stock, both graft and stock being usually very small;
                    the grafted root is then potted so as to cover the point of junction with the
                    soil, and is plunged in the bed of the propagating house, where it gets the
                    slight stimulus of a gentle bottom heat. Dahlias (fig. 57) and naeonies may be
                    grafted by inserting young shoots into the neck of one of the fleshy roots of
                    each kind respectively—the best method of doing so being to cut a triangular
                    section near the upper end of the root, just large enough to admit the young
                    shoot when slightly pared away on two sides to give it a similar form. In the
                    case of large woody plants thus worked (fig. 58) the grafted roots, after the
                    operation is completed, are planted in nursery beds, so that the upper buds only
                    are exposed to the atmosphere, as shown at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in the
                    figure.</p>
                <p>(11) <hi rend="italic">By Buds.—</hi> Budding is the inserting of a bud cut with
                    a portion of bark of the plant to be propagated into the bark of the stock,
                    where it is bound gently but firmly. Stone fruits, such as peaches, apricots,
                    plums, cherries, &amp;c., are propagated in this way, as well as roses, and many
                    other plants. In the propagating house budding may be done at any season when
                    the sap is in motion; but for fruit trees, roses, &amp;c., in the open air, it
                    is usually done in July or August, when the buds destined for the following year
                    are completely formed in the axils of the leaves, and when the bark separates
                    freely from the wood it covers. Those buds are to be preferred, as being best
                    ripened, which occur on the middle portion of a young shoot.</p>
                <p>The simplest and most generally practised form of budding is that called <hi
                    rend="italic">Shield-budding or ^T-budding</hi> (fig. 59). The operator should
                    be provided with a budding-knife in which the cutting edge of the blade is
                    rounded off at the point, and which has a thin ivory or bone handle, for raising
                    the bark of the stock. A horizontal incision is made in the bark quite down to
                    the wood, and from this a perpendicular slit is drawn downwards to the extent of
                    perhaps an inch, so that the slit has a resemblance to the letter T, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> A bud is then cut by a clean incision from the tree
                    intended to be propagated, having a portion of the wood attached to it, and so
                    that the whole may be an inch and a half long, as at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi>
                    The bit of wood <hi rend="italic">e</hi> must be gently withdrawn, care being
                    taken that the bud adheres wholly to the bark or shield, as it is called, of
                    which /is a side view. The bark on each side of the perpendicular slit being
                    then cautiously opened, as at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> with the handle of the
                    knife, the bud and shield are inserted as shown at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The
                    upper tip of the shield is cut off horizontally, and brought to fit the oark of
                    the stock at the transverse incision. . Slight ties of soft cotton wool or
                    worsted, or even moist bast-matting, are then applied. In about a month or six
                    weeks the ligatures may be taken away, when, if the operation has been
                    successful, the bud will be fresh and full, and the shield firmly united to the
                    wood. In the following spring a strong shoot will be thrown out, and to this the
                    stock is headed down by gradations during the course of the summer.</p>
                <p>To be successful the operation should be performed with a quick and light hand,
                    so that no part of the delicate tissues be injured, as would happen if they were
                    left for a time exposed, or if the bud were forced in like a wedge. The union is
                    effected as in grafting, by means of the organizable sap or cambium, and the
                    less this is disturbed until the inner bark of the shield is pressed and fixed
                    against it the better. Inverted T-budding, in which the two incisions are in the
                    form ±, is for some reasons preferable to the more ordinary method.</p>
                <p>(12) <hi rend="italic">By Branch Cuttings. —</hi> Propagation by cuttings is the
                    mode of increase most commonly adopted, next to that by seeds. It is effected by
                    taking a portion from a branch or shoot of the plant, and placing it in the
                    soil. There are great differences to be observed in the selection and treatment
                    of cuttings. Sometimes soft green shoots, as in <hi rend="italic">Verbena</hi>
                    (fig. 60, a), are used; sometimes the shoots must be half-ripened, and sometimes
                    fully matured. So of the mode of preparation; some will root if cut off’ or
                    broken off at any point and thrust into wet earth or sand in a warm place (fig.
                    60, α); others require to be cut with the utmost care just below a joint or
                    leaf-base, and by a keen blade so as to sever the tissues without tearing or
                    bruising; and others again after being cut across require to be split up for a
                    short distance. It is usual and in most cases necessary to cut away the lower
                    portion of a cutting up to just below the noαe or joint (fig. 60, <hi
                    rend="italic">b, d, e).</hi> The internodal parts will not often divide so as to
                    form separate individual plants; sometimes, however, this happens; it is said
                    that the smallest piece of <hi rend="italic">Torenia asiatica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> for instance, will grow. Then as to position,
                    certain cuttings grow readily enough if planted outdoors in the open soil, some
                    preferring shade, others sunshine, while less hardy subjects must be covered
                    with a bell-glass, or must be in a close atmosphere with bottom heat, or must
                    have the aid of pure silver sand to facilitate their rooting (fig. 60, c).
                    Cuttings should in all cases be taken from healthy plants, and from shoots of a
                    moderate degree of vigour. It is also important to select leafy growths, and not
                    such as will at once run up to flower. Young shoots which have become moderately
                    firm generally make the best cuttings, but sometimes the very softest shoots
                    strike more readily. For all plants in a growing state spring is the safest time
                    for taking cuttings.</p>
                <p>Cuttings of deciduous plants should be taken off after the fall of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0249-0238"/> the leaf, and should have all underground buds
                    carefully removed so as to prevent as far as possible the formation of suckers.
                    These cuttings should be about one foot in length, and should be planted at once
                    in the ground so as to leave only the top with the two or three preserved buds
                    exposed. If a clean stem, however, is desired, a longer portion may be left
                    uncovered.</p>
                <p>Cuttings of growing plants are prepared by removing with a sharp knife, and
                    moderately close, the few leaves which would otherwise be buried in the soil;
                    they are then cut clean across just below a joint; the fewer the leaves thus
                    removed, however, the better, as if kept from being exhausted they help to
                    supply the organizable matter out of which the roots are formed. Free-rooting
                    subjects strike in any lightish sandy mixture; but difficult subjects should
                    have thoroughly well-drained pots, a portion of the soil proper for the
                    particular plants made very sandy, and a surfacing of clean sharp silver sand
                    about as deep as the length of the cutting (fig. 60, c). Mr Ayres, writing in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</hi> (1843, p. 116), recommends
                    5-inch pots for cuttings; and these he prepares by placing over the hole at the
                    bottom of each an inverted 3-inch pot, around it potsherds broken small, over
                    these some moss, and then the compost made up of equal quantities of peat, sand,
                    and leaf-mould, leaving about half an inch at top for white sand, which runs
                    into the holes as the cuttings are inserted. Mr Ayres advises that “a stock of
                    pots thus prepared should be kept in a frame or propagating house, as nothing is
                    so injurious to cuttings taken from plants growing in heat as to put them into
                    cold soil. Cuttings cannot be too short if they have the necessary buds to form
                    a plant; neither can they be inserted too shallow, if they are made firm in the
                    pots.”</p>
                <p>All plants while striking may be kept in a temperature rather higher than that in
                    which they grow naturally, and the soil about them should be kept moist,
                    although they must not from want of drainage in any degree get sodden with wet.
                    The humidity kept up about the cuttings is maintained by covering them with
                    bell-glasses, or setting them in handlights or small glazed frames of convenient
                    size.</p>
                <p>A special contrivance for a cutting pot (fig. 61) was brought into notice many
                    years ago by Mr A. Forsyth. A smaller pot was put into a larger one, the hole at
                    the bottom being closed with clay <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> the bottom of the
                    outer pot is filled with crocks <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> so that the small pot
                    is brought up to the level of the larger one; and the space between the two pots
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is filled with propagating soil, the cuttings being so
                    planted that their ends rest against the sides of the inner pot, which is then
                    filled with water, and this passing slowly through the sides of the pots, just
                    keeps the soil moistened.</p>
                <p>Such delicate plants as heaths are reared in silver sand, a stratum of which is
                    placed over the sandy peat soil in the cutting pot, and thus the cuttings,
                    though rooting in the sand, find at once on the emission of roots congenial soil
                    for them to grow in (fig. 60, c).</p>
                <p>Hardy plants, such as pinks, pansies, &amp;c., are propagated by cuttings planted
                    during early summer in light rich soil. The cuttings of pinks are called pipings
                    (fig. 60, &lt;Z), and are planted about June, while pansies may be renewed in
                    this way both in spring and in autumn.</p>
                <p>(13) <hi rend="italic">By Leaf Cuttings.—</hi> Many plants may be propagated by
                    planting their leaves or portions of their leaves as cuttings, as, for example,
                    the herbaceous <hi rend="italic">Gloxinia</hi> (fig. 62, α) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesnera,</hi> the succulent <hi rend="italic">Sempervivum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Echeveria, Pachyphytum,</hi> and their allies, and such
                    hard-leaved plants as <hi rend="italic">Theophrasta</hi> (fig. 62, δ). The
                    leaves are best taken off with the base whole, and should be planted in
                    well-drained sandy soil; in due time they form roots, and ultimately from some
                    latent bud a little shoot which forms the young plant. The treatment is
                    precisely like that of branch cuttings. Gloxinias, begonias, &amp;c., grow
                    readily from fragments of the leaves cut clean through the thick veins and ribs,
                    and planted edgewise like cuttings. This class of subjects may also be fixed
                    flat on the surface of the cutting pot, by means of little pegs or hooks, the
                    main ribs being cut across at intervals, and from these points roots, and
                    eventually young tubers, will be produced (fig. 63).</p>
                <p>(Ί4) <hi rend="italic">By Root Cuttings.—</hi> Some plants which are not easily
                    increased by other means propagate readily from root cuttings. Amongst the
                    indoor plants which may be so treated, the <hi rend="italic">Bouvardia,
                    Pelargonium, Arabia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wigandia</hi> may be mentioned.
                    The <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi</hi> is to turn the
                    plant out of its pot, shake away the soil so as to free the roots, and then
                    select as many pieces of the stouter roots as may be required. These are cut up
                    into half-inch lengths (sometimes less), and inserted in light sandy soil round
                    the margin of a cutting pot, so that the upper end of the root cutting may be
                    level with the soil or only just covered by it. The pots should be watered so as
                    to settle the soil, and be placed in the close atmosphere of the propagating pit
                    or frame, where they will need scarcely any water until the buds are seen
                    pushing through the surface.</p>
                <p>There are various herbaceous plants which may be similarly treated, such as
                    sea-kale and horseradish, and, among ornamental plants, the beautiful
                    autumn-blooming <hi rend="italic">Anemone japonica</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Senecio pulcher.</hi> The sea-kale and horseradish require to be treated in the
                    open garden, where the cut portions should be planted in lines in well-worked
                    soil; but the roots of the <hi rend="italic">Anemone</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Senecio</hi> should be planted in pots and kept in a close frame with a little
                    warmth till the young shoots have started.</p>
                <p>Various hardy ornamental trees are also increased in this way, as the quince,
                    elm, robinia, and mulberry, and the rose amongst shrubs. The most important use
                    to which this mode of propagation is put is, however, the increase of roses, and
                    of the various plums used as stocks for working the choicer stone fruits. The
                    method in the latter case is to select roots averaging the thickness of the
                    little finger, to cut these into lengths of about 3 of 4 inches, and to plant
                    them in lines just beneath the surface in nursery beds. The root cuttings of
                    rose-stocks are prepared and treated in a similar way.</p>

                    surface in pots of light soil, which are placed in.a hot bed or propagating pit,
                    and in due time each pushes up a young shoot which forms the future stem, while
                    from about its base the young roots are produced (fig. 64, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b)</hi> which convert it into an independent plant. In the case of plants with
                    persistent leaves, the stem may be cut through just above and below the bud,
                    retaining the leaf which is left on the cutting, the old wood and eye being
                    placed beneath the oil and the leaf left exposed. In this way the india-rubber

                    example, and many other tender plants may be increased with the aid of a brisk
                    bottom heat. Many of the free-growing soft-wood ed plants may also be grown from
                    cuttings of single joints of the young wood, where rapid increase is desired;
                    and in the case of oppof ite-Ieaved plants two cuttings may often be made from
                    one joint by splitting the stem longitudinally, each cutting consisting of a
                    leaf and a perfect bud attached to half the thickness of the stem.</p>
                <p>22, <hi rend="italic">Planting and Transplanting.—</hi> In preparing a fruit tree
                    for transplantation, the first thing to be done is to open a trench round it at
                    a distance of from 3 to 4 feet, according to size. The trench should be opened
                    to about two spades’ depth, and any coarse roots which may extend thus far from
                    the trunk may be cut clean off with a sharp knife. The soil between the trench
                    and the stem is to be reduced as far as may seem necessary or practicable by
                    means of a digging fork, the roots as soon as they are liberated being fixed on
                    one side and carefully preserved. By working in this way all round the ball, the
                    best roots will be got out and preserved, and the ball lightened of all
                    superfluous soil. The tree will then be ready to lift if carefully prized up
                    from beneath the ball, and if it does not lift readily, it will probably be
                    found that a root has struck downwards, which will have to be sought out and cut
                    through. Whenever practicable, it is best to secure a ball of earth round the
                    roots. On the tree being lifted from its hole the roots should be examined, and
                    all which have been severed roughly with the spade should have the ends cut
                    smooth with the knife to facilitate the emission of fibres. The tree can then be
                    transported to its new position. The hole for its reception should be of
                    sufficient depth to allow the base of the ball of earth, or of the roots, to
                    stand so that the point whence the uppermost roots spring from the stem may be 2
                    or 3 inches above the general surface level. Then the bottom being regulated so
                    as to leave the soil rather highest in the centre, the plant is to be set in the
                    hole in the position desired, and steadied there by hand. Next the roots from
                    the lower portion of the ball are to be sought out and laid outwards in lines
                    radiating from the stem, being distributed equally on all sides as nearly as
                    this can be done; some fine and suitable good earth should be thrown amongst the
                    roots as they are thus being placed, and worked in well up to the base of the
                    ball. The soil covering the roots may be gently pressed down, but the tree
                    should not be pulled up and down, as is sometimes done, to settle the soil. This
                    done, another set of roots higher up the ball must be laid out in the same way,
                    and again another, until the whole of the roots, thus carefully laid, are
                    embedded as firmly as may be in the soil, which may now receive another gentle
                    treading. The stem should next be supported permanently, either by one stake or
                    by three, according to its size. The excavation will now be filled up about
                    two-thirds perhaps; and if so the tree may have a thorough good watering,
                    sufficient to settle the soil closely about its roots. After twenty-four hours
                    the hole may be levelled in, with moderate treading, if the water has soaked
                    well in, the surface being left slightly sloping upwards towards the stem of the
                    tree. In transplanting trees of the ornamental class, less need be attempted in
                    respect to providing new soil, although the soil should be made as congenial as
                    practicable.</p>
                <p>In transplanting smaller subjects, such as plants for the flower garden, much
                    less effort is required. The plant must be lifted with as little injury to its
                    rootlets as possible, and carefully set into the hole, the soil being filled in
                    round it, and carefully pressed close by the hand. For moving small plants the
                    garden trowel is a very convenient tool, but we are inclined to give the
                    preference to the hand-fork (fig. 45). For larger masses, such as strong-growing
                    herbaceous plants, a spade or digging-fork will be requisite.</p>
                <p>When seedlings of vigorous plants have to be “pricked out,” a dibble (fig. 64) is
                    the best implement to be used. The ground being prepared and, if necessary,
                    enriched, and the surface made fine and smooth, a hole is made with the dibble
                    deep enough and large enough to receive the roots of the seedling plants without
                    doubling them up, and the hole is filled in by working the soil close to the
                    plant with the point of the dibble. The pricking out of seedlings in pots in the
                    propagating pit is effected in a similar way. The plants, indeed, often require
                    to be removed and set from half an inch to an inch apart before they have become
                    sufficiently developed to admit. of being handled with any degree of facility,
                    and for these a pointed stick of convenient size is used as a dibble. In extreme
                    cases it is best to lift the little seedling on the end of a flattish pointed
                    stick, pressing this into the new soil where the plant is to be placed, and
                    liberating it and closing the earth about it by the aid of a similar stick held
                    in the other hand.</p>
                <p>Large trees may be successfully transplanted by the aid of transplanting
                    machines, of which different forms are in use. These will be found figured and
                    described in the various horticultural and arboricultural publications. See, <hi

                    trees is during the early autumn months. As regards evergreens opinions are
                    divided, some preferring August and September, others April or May. They can be
                    successfully planted at either period, but for subjects which are at all
                    difficult to remove the spring months are to be preferred.</p>
                <p>23. <hi rend="italic">Potting and Repotting.—</hi> Garden pots are made with a
                    comparatively large hole in the bottom, and those of the largest size have also
                    holes at the side near the bottom; these openings are to prevent the soil
                    becoming saturated or soured with superabundant water. To prepare the pot for
                    the plant, a broadish piece of potsherd, called a “crock,” is placed over the
                    large hole, and if there be side holes they also are covered. The bottom crock
                    is made from a piece of a broken garden pot, and is laid with the convex side
                    upwards; then comes a layer of irregular pieces of crock of various sizes, about
                    an inch deep in a 5-inch pot, 2 inches in an 11-inch or 12-inch pot, &amp;c. The
                    mode of crocking a pot is shown in fig. 65. A few of the coarser lumps from the
                    outer edge of the heap of potting soil are spread over the crocks. The same end,
                    that of keeping the finer particles of the soil from mixing with the drainage
                    crocks, may be attained by shaking in a little clean moss. A handful or two of
                    the soil is then put in, and on this the plant with its roots spread out is to
                    be set a trifle higher than the plant should stand in the pot when finished off;
                    more soil is to be added, and the whole pressed firmly with the fingers, the
                    base of the stem being just below the potrim, and the surface being smoothed off
                    so as to slope a little outwards. When finished off, the pots should be well
                    watered, to settle the soil; but they should stand till the water has well
                    drained away, since, if they are moved about while the fresh soil is very wet,
                    there will be a risk of its becoming puddled or too much consolidated. Larger
                    plants do not need quite such delicate treatment, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0251-0240"/> but care should be taken not to handle the roots
                    roughly. The soil for these should be less comminuted, and the amount of
                    drainage material more ample. Larger bodies of soil also require to be more
                    thoroughly consolidated before watering; otherwise they would settle down so as
                    to leave an unsightly void at the pot-rim.</p>
                <p>Some plants, especially when potted temporarily, may be dealt with in a simpler
                    way. A single crock may be used in some cases, and in others no crock at all,
                    but a handful of half-decayed leaves or half-decayed dung thrown into the bottom
                    of the pot. This mode of potting does well for bulbs, such as hyacinths, which
                    are either thrown away or planted out when the bloom is over. The bedding plants
                    generally may be potted in this way, the advantage being that at planting-out
                    time there is less risk of disturbing the roots than if there were potsherds to
                    remove. Plants of this character should be potted a little less firmly than
                    specimens which are likely to stand long in the pot, and indeed the soil should
                    be made comparatively light by the intermixture of leaf-mould or some
                    equivalent, in order that the roots may run freely and quickly into it.</p>
                <p>For epiphytal plants like orchids the most thorough drainage must be secured by
                    the abundant use of potsherds, small pots being sometimes inserted inside the
                    larger ones, or by planting in shallow pots or pans, so that there shall be no
                    large mass of soil to get consolidated. For most of these the lightest spongy
                    but sweet turfy peat must be used, this being packed lightly about the roots,
                    and built up above the pot-rim, or in some cases freely mixed before use with
                    chopped sphagnum moss and nodules of broken pots or of charcoal. The plants
                    under these conditions often require to be supported by wooden pegs or sticks.
                    Some of the species grow better when altogether taken out of the soil and fixed
                    to blocks of wood, but in this case they require a little coaxing with moss
                    about the roots until they get established. In other cases they are planted in
                    open baskets of wood or wire, using the porous peat and sphagnum compost. Both
                    blocks and baskets are usually suspended from the roof of the house, hanging
                    free, so that no accumulation of water is possible. In these cases, however, the
                    greatest caution is necessary to prevent the plants from suffering from
                    drought.</p>
                <p>When repotting is adopted as a temporary expedient, as in the case of bedding-out
                    plants which it is required to push forward as much as possible, it will suffice
                    if provision is made to prevent the drainage hole from getting blocked, and a
                    rich light compost is provided for the encouragement of the roots. When,
                    however, a hard-wooded plant has to be repotted, the case is different; it may
                    stand without further potting for one year or two years or more, and therefore
                    much more care is necessary. The old ball of earth must be freed from all or
                    most of the old crocks without doing injury to the roots, and the sharp edge of
                    the upper surface gently rubbed off. If there be any sour or sodden or effete
                    soil into which the roots have not run, this should be carefully picked out with
                    a pointed stick. The ball is to be set on the new soil just high enough that
                    when finished the base of the stem may be about level with the pot-rim, towards
                    which the surface should slope gently, and the space between the old ball and
                    the sides of the pot is to be filled in gradually with the prepared compost,
                    which is from time to time to be pressed down with a blunt-ended flat piece of
                    wood called a potting-stick, so as to render the new soil as solid as the old.
                    The object of this is to prevent the plant from starving by the water applied
                    all running off by way of the new soil, and not penetrating the original ball of
                    earth. When this amount of pressure is necessary, especially in the case of
                    loamy composts, the soil itself should be rather inclined to dryness, and should
                    in no case be sufficiently moist to knead together into a pasty mass. In
                    ordinary cases the potting soil should be just so far removed from dryness that
                    when a handful is gently pressed it may hang together, but may lose its cohesion
                    when dropped.</p>
                <p>When plants are required to stand in ornamental china pots or vases, it is better
                    both for the plants and for avoiding risk of breakage to grow them in ordinary
                    garden pots of a size that will drop into the more valuable vessels. Slate pots
                    or tubs, usually square, are sometimes adopted, and are durable and otherwise
                    unobjectionable, only, their sides being less porous, the earth does not dry so
                    rapidly, and some modification of treatment as to watering is necessary. For
                    large conservatory specimens wooden tubs, round or square, are frequently used;
                    these should be coated with pitch inside to render them more durable.</p>
                <p>Various other contrivances take the place of garden pots for special purposes.
                    Thus shallow square or oblong wooden boxes, made of light inexpensive wood, are
                    very useful for seed-sowing, for pricking out seedlings, or for planting
                    cuttings. When the disturbance of the roots incidental to all transplanting is
                    sought to be avoided, the seed or plant is started in some cases in squares of
                    turf (used grassy-side downwards), which can when ready be transferred to the
                    place the plant is to occupy. Cucumber and melon plants and vines reared from
                    eyes are sometimes started in this way, both for the reason above mentioned, and
                    because it prevents the curling of the roots apt to take place in plants raised
                    in pots. Strips of turf are sometimes used for the rearing of early peas, which
                    are sown in a warmish house or frame, and gradually hardened so as to bear
                    exposure before removal to the open air.</p>
                <p>24. <hi rend="italic">Watering.—</hi> The guiding principle in watering plants is
                    to do it thoroughly when it is required, and to abstain from giving a second
                    supply till the first has been taken up.</p>
                <p>When watering becomes necessary for kitchen-garden crops, the hose should be laid
                    on and the lines of esculents allowed to drink their fill, if fresh succulent
                    vegetables are desired. So also, if well-swelled and luscious fruits, such as
                    strawberries, are required, there must be no parching at the roots. This applies
                    even more strongly to conservatory borders and to forcing-houses than to the
                    outside fruit-tree borders, because from these the natural rain supply is in
                    most cases more distinctly cut off. In the case of forcing-houses, the water
                    should be heated before being applied to the borders containing the roots of the
                    trees.</p>
                <p>In the watering of pot plants the utmost care is requisite if the plant be a
                    shy-growing or valuable one, and yet it is almost impossible to give any
                    intelligible instruction for performing the operation. The roots should never be
                    suffered either to get thoroughly dry or to get sodden with excess of water. An
                    adept will know by the ring of the pot on striking it with his knuckles whether
                    water is wanted or not, according as it rings loud and clear or dull and heavy.
                    With very choice subjects watering may be necessary two or three times a day in
                    drying summer weather. It is a wrong though common practice to press the surface
                    of the soil in the pot in order to feel if it is moist enough, as this soon
                    consolidates it, and prevents it from getting the full benefit of aeration.</p>
                <p>In all heated houses the water used should be warmed at least up to the
                    temperature of the atmosphere, so as to avoid chilling the roots. This is also
                    necessary in the case of water used for syringing the plants, which should be
                    done two or three times a day in all stoves and forcinghouses, especially during
                    the period when the young growth is being developed. The damping of all
                    absorbent surfaces, such as the floors or bare walls, &amp;c., is frequently

                    advantage of laying the floors a little rounded, as then the water draws off to
                    the sides against the kerbstone, while the centre remains dry for
                    promenaders.</p>
                <p>In cooler structures it becomes necessary in the dull season of the year to
                    prevent the slopping of water over the plants or on the floor, as this tends to
                    cause “damping off,”—the stems assuming a state of mildewy decay, which not
                    unfrequently, if it once attacks a plant, will destroy it piece by piece. For
                    the same reason cleanliness and free ventilation are of great importance.</p>
                <p>25. <hi rend="italic">Pruning.—</hi> Pruning is a very important operation in the
                    fruit garden, its object being twofold,—(1) to give form to the tree, and (2) to
                    induce the free production of flower buds as the precursors of a plentiful crop
                    of fruit. To form a standard tree, either the stock is allowed to grow up with a
                    straight stem, by cutting away all side branches up to the height required, say
                    about 6 feet, the scion or bud being worked at that point, and the head
                    developed therefrom; or the stock is worked close to the ground, and the young
                    shoot obtained therefrom is allowed to grow up in the same way, being pruned in
                    its progress to keep it single and straight, and the top being cut off when the
                    desired height is reached, so as to cause the growth of lateral shoots. If these
                    are three or four in number, and fairly balanced as to strength and position,
                    little pruning will be required. The tips of unripened wood should be cut back
                    about one-third their length at an outwardly placed bud, and the chief pruning
                    thereafter required will be to cut away inwardly directed shoots which cross or
                    crowd each other and tend to confuse the centre of the tree. Bushy heads should
                    be thinned out, and those that are too large cut back so as to remodel them. If
                    the shoots produced are not sufficient in number, or are badly placed, or very
                    unequal in vigour, the head should be cut back moderately close, leaving a few
                    inches only of the young shoots, which should be pruned back to buds so placed
                    as to furnish shoots in .the positions desired. When worked at the top of a stem
                    formed of the stock, the growth from the graft or bud must be pruned in a
                    similar way. Three or four leading shoots should be selected to pass ere long
                    into boughs and form a well-balanced skeleton for the tree; these boughs,
                    however, will soon grow beyond any artificial system the pruner may adopt.</p>
                <p>To form a dwarf or bush fruit tree the stock must be worked near the ground, and
                    the young shoot produced from the scion or bud must be cutback to whatever
                    height it is desired the dwarf stem should be, say 1⅜ to 2 feet.</p>
                <p>The young shoots produced from the portion of the new wood retained are to form
                    the skeleton of the bush tree, and must be dealt with as in the case of standard
                    trees. The growth of inwardly-directed shoots is to be prevented, and the centre
                    kept open, the tree assuming a cup-shaped out-li <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi>

                <p>In forming a pyramidal tree, the lateral growths, instead of being removed, as in
                    the standard tree, are encouraged to the utmost; and in order to strengthen them
                    the upper part of the leading shoot is removed annually, the side branches being
                    also shortened somewhat as the tree advances in size. In fig. 67, reduced from
                    Μ. Hardy’s work, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> shows a young tree with its second
                    year’s growth, the upright shoot of the maiden tree having been moderately
                    headed back, being left longer if the buds near the base promise to break
                    freely, or cut shorter if they are weak and wanting in vigour. The winter
                    pruning, carried out with the view to shape the tree into a well-grown pyramid,
                    would be effected at the places marked by a cross line. The lowest branch would
                    have four buds retained, the end one being on the lower side of the branch. The
                    two next would be cut to three buds, which here also are fortunately so situated
                    that the upper one is on the lower side of the branches. The fourth is not cut
                    at all, its terminal bud being allowed to grow to draw strength into it. The
                    fifth is an example where the bud to which the shoot should be cut back is
                    wrongly placed; a shoot resulting from such a cut is apt instead of growing
                    outwards to grow erect, and lead to confusion in the form of the tree, to avoid

                    the summer by a small twig. The upper shoots are cut closer in. Near the base of
                    the stem are two prominent buds, which would produce two vigorous shoots, but
                    these would be too near the ground, and the buds should therefore be suppressed;
                    but, to strengthen the lower part, the weaker buds just above and below the
                    lowest branch should be forced into growth, by making a transverse incision
                    close above each. Fig. 67, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> shows what a similar tree
                    would be at the end of the third year’s growth.</p>
                <p>In order to bring a young tree into the cordon shape, all its side branches are
                    shortened back, either to form permanent spurs, as in the case of pears, or to
                    yield annual young shoots, as in peaches and nectarines. The single-stemmed
                    cordon may be trained horizontally, obliquely at any required angle, or
                    vertically if required, the first two arrangements being preferable. If a double
                    cordon is required, the original young stem must be headed back, and the two
                    best shoots produced must be selected, trained right and left, and treated as
                    for the single cordon.</p>
                <p>The forms chiefly adopted for trees trained to walls and espalier rails are the
                    fan-shaped, the half-fan, and the horizontal, with their various
                    modifications.</p>
                <p>Of late years the close pruning of the young trees has been objected to, and the
                    “extension system” has, in many cases, been adopted. The maiden tree is headed
                    down, and two shoots led away right and left. Two laterals should be allowed to
                    grow from the upper side of them, one from near the base, the other from near
                    the middle, all others being pinched out beyond the second or third leaf during
                    summer, but cut away to the last bud in winter. The tree will thus consist of
                    six shoots, probably 3 feet to 4 feet long, which are not to be pruned unless
                    they are unequal in strength, a defect which is rather to be remedied by summer
                    pinching than by winter pruning. The second year three young shoots are to be
                    left on each of the six, one close to the base, one about the middle, and one at
                    the point, the rest being rubbed off. These three shoots will produce laterals,
                    of which one or two may be selected and laid in; and thus a number of moderately
                    strong fertile shoots will be obtained, and at the end of the season a
                    comparatively large tree will be the result.</p>
                <p>The method of pruning formerly adopted for the formation of a fan-shaped tree was
                    to head down the maiden plant to about two eyes, so placed as to yield a young
                    shoot on each side (fig. 68), the supernumerary shoots being rubbed off while
                    quite young, and the reserved shoots trained against the wall during the summer
                    so as to get them well matured. The next year they were cut back again, often
                    nearly to the base, in order that the lower pair of these shoots might each
                    produce two well-placed young shoots, and the upper pair three young shoots. The
                    tree would thus consist of ten shoots, to be laid out at regular distances, and
                    then if closely cut the skeleton of the tree would be as in fig. 69. These main
                    shoots were not again to be shortened back, but from each of them three young
                    shoots were to be selected and trained in two, on the upper side, one near the
                    base, and the other halfway up, and one on the lower side placed about midway
                    between these two; these with the leading shoot, which was also to be nailed in,
                    made four branches of the current year from each of the ten main branches, and
                    the form of the tree would therefore be that of fig. 70. The other young shoots
                    produced were pinched off while quite young, to throw all the strength of the
                    tree into those which were to form its basis, and to secure abundant light and
                    air. In after years the leading shoot was not to be cut back, but all the
                    lateral shoots were to be shortened, and from these year by year other shoots
                    were to be selected to fill up the area occupied by the tree.</p>
                <p>In pruning for a horizontal tree the young maiden tree has to be headed back
                    nearly to its base, and from the young shoots three are to be selected, the two
                    best placed lower ones to form an opposite or nearly opposite pair of main
                    branches, and the best placed upper one to continue the erect stem (fig. 71).
                    This upper shoot is at the next winter pruning to be cut down to within about a
                    foot of the point whence it sprung, and its buds rubbed off except the upper one
                    for a leader, and one on each side just below it to furnish another pair of side
                    shoots; these being trained in position, the tree would appear as in fig. 72.
                    The same course is to be followed annually till the space is filled. Sometimes
                    in very favourable soils and with vigorous trees two pairs of branches may be
                    obtained in one season by summer-stopping the erect shoots and selecting others
                    from the young growths thus induced, but more commonly the trees have to be
                    built up by forming one pair of branches annually. The shoots are not at first
                    lowered to the horizontal line, but are brought down gradually; and while the
                    tree is being formed weak shoots may be allowed to grow in a more erect position
                    than it is ultimately intended they should occupy. Thus in four or five years
                    the tree will have acquired something the character of fig. 73, and will go on
                    thus increasing until the space is filled.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0254-0243"/>
                <p>The half-fan is a combination of the two forms, but as regards pruning does not
                    materially differ from the horizontal, as two opposite side branches are
                    produced in succession upwards till the space is filled, only they are not taken
                    out so abruptly, but are allowed to rise at an acute angle and then to curve
                    into the horizontal line.</p>
                <p>In all the various forms of cordons, in horizontal training, and in fan and
                    half-fan training, the pruning of the main branches when the form of the tree is
                    worked out will vary in accordance with the kind of fruit under treatment. Thus
                    in the peach, nectarine, apricot, plum, and cherry, which are commonly trained
                    fan-fashion, the .first two will have to be pruned so as to keep a succession of
                    young annual shoots, these being their fruit-bearing wood. The others are
                    generally pruned so as to combine a moderate supply of young wood with a greater
                    or less number of fruit spurs. In the pear and apple the fruit is borne
                    principally on spurs, and hence what is known as spur-pruning has to be adopted,
                    the young shoots being all cut back nearly to their base, so as to cause fruit
                    buds to evolve from the remaining eyes or buds. Cordons of apples and pears have
                    to be similarly treated, but cordons of peaches and nectarines are pruned so as
                    to provide the necessary annual succession of young bearing wood.</p>
                <p>The nature of the cut itself in pruning is of more consequence, especially in the
                    case of fruit trees, than at first sight may appear. The branches should be
                    separated by a clean cut at an angle of about 45°, just at the back of a bud,
                    the cut entering on a level with the base of the bud and passing out on a level
                    with its top (fig. 7 4, <hi rend="italic">a∖</hi> for when cut in this way the
                    wound becomes rapidly covered with new wood, as soon as growth recommences,
                    whereas if the cut is too close the bud is starved, or if less close an ugly and
                    awkward snag is left. Fig. 74, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> are examples of the former, and <hi rend="italic">d, e, f</hi> of the
                    latter. Dr Lindley has designated the cut shown at fig. 74, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> the cut to the quick <hi rend="italic">{Gardeners' Chronicle,</hi> 1847,
                    p. 19) :—</p>
                <p>“In order to avoid the risk of the ‘cut to the quick,’ some gardeners make use of
                    the ‘ snag cut ’ <hi rend="italic">(d, e, f),</hi> in which the wound is made on
                    the same side of tlιe branch as that occupied by the bud, slanting downwards
                    towards it. That plan is objectionable; for it involves the necessity of leaving
                    behind a dead portion of the branch, to be removed at a later pruning, so the
                    work must be done twice over; moreover, it is an admission of a want of the
                    skill required to make the ‘ clean cut ’ skilfully. Lastly, there is the ‘
                    slivering cut’ (c), in which a long ragged unequal shave is taken off the
                    branch, much too low in the beginning, and much too high at the end. It is the
                    cut made by garden labourers. It is clumsy, ugly, awkward, and dangerous, for it
                    is apt to injure the branch on which it is made. In all cases, the amputation
                    should be made by one firm-drawn cut. The clean cut can be performed by a
                    dexterous operator to within a shaving of the right line; and the mastery of
                    this art is no mean acquisition.”</p>
                <p>In the case of fruit trees, and indeed of deciduous plants generally, pruning
                    requires to be done during the winter or resting period, and the earlier in that
                    period the better, as then the buds become plump and full of sap, and produce
                    strong shoots when the time for growth arrives. If, on the contrary, it is done
                    while the plant is in full growth, the whole system of the tree sustains a
                    check, the circulation is deranged, the quality of the sap becomes deteriorated,
                    and a dead stump or unhealthy shoot is the frequent result. This, however, does
                    not apply to the pruning of the herbaceous or succulent growths of the current
                    season, nor to soft-wooded plants generally, for this kind of pruning, called
                    summer pruning, is essential to the formation of handsome specimens of the
                    latter, and is a very important help in the formation of the fruit or blossom
                    buds of fruit trees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Summer Pruning</hi> should be performed while the shoots are
                    yet young and succulent, so that they may in most cases be nipped off with the
                    thumb-nail. It is very necessary in the case of trees trained to a flat surface,
                    as a wall or espalier rail, to prevent undue crowding. In some cases, as, for
                    example, with peaches, the superfluous shoots are wholly removed, and certain
                    selected shoots reserved to supply bearing wood for next year. In others, as
                    pears, the tops of the young shoots are removed, leaving three or four leaves
                    and their buds at the base, to be developed into fruit buds by the additional
                    nourishment thus thrown into them (fig. 75, <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> One or
                    two may push out a late summer growth, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; this will serve
                    as a vent for the vigour of the tree, and if the lowermost only go to the
                    formation of a fruit spur, the object will have been gained. They are cut to the
                    last dormant bud in winter.</p>
                <p>But summer pruning has been much extended since the introduction of restricted
                    growth and the use of dwarfing stocks. Orchard-house trees, and also pyramidal
                    and bush trees of apples, pears, and plums, are mainly fashioned by summer
                    pruning; in fact, the less the knife is used upon them, except in the necessary
                    cutting of the roots in potted trees, the better. In the case of orchard-house
                    plants no shoots are suffered to lengthen out, except as occasionally wanted to
                    fill up a gap in the outline of the tree. On the contrary, the tops of all young
                    shoots are pinched off when some three or four leaves are formed, and this is
                    done again and again throughout the season. When this pruning is just brought to
                    a balance with the vigour of the roots, the consequence is that fruit buds are
                    formed all over the tree, instead of a thicket of sterile and useless wood.
                    Pyramidal and bush trees out of doors are, of course, suffered to become
                    somewhat larger, and sufficient wood must be allowed to grow to give them the
                    form desired; but after the first year or two, when the framework is laid out,
                    they are permitted to extend very slowly, and never to any great extent, while
                    the young growths are continually nipped off, so as to clothe the branches with
                    fruit buds as closely placed as will permit of their healthy development.<note

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pruning' of Flowering Plants</hi> is generally a much
                    lighter matter than the pruning of fruit trees. If a young seedling or cutting
                    of any soft-wooded plant is to be bushy, it must have its top nipped out by the
                    thumb-nail or pruning-scissors at a very early stage, and this stopping must be
                    repeated frequently. If what is called a well-furnished plant is required, an
                    average of from 2 to 3 inches is all the extension that must be permitted<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n255/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0255-0244"/>—sometimes scarcely so much—before the top is
                    nipped out; and this must be continued until the desired size is attained,
                    whether that be large or small. Then generally the plant is allowed to grow away
                    till bloom or blooming shoots are developed. To form a pyramidal plant, which is
                    <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ά</hi> very elegant and useful shape to give to a
                    decorative pot plant, the main stem should be encouraged to grow upright, for a
                    length perhaps of 6 or 8 inches before it is topped; this induces the formation
                    of laterals, and favours their development. The best-placed upper young shoot is
                    selected and trained upright to a slender stake, and this also is topped when it
                    has advanced 6 or 8 inches further, in order to induce the laterals on the
                    second portion to push freely. This process is continued till the required size
                    is gained. With all the difficult and slow-growing plants of the hard-wooded
                    section, all the pruning must be done in this gradual way in the young wood as
                    the plant progresses.</p>
                <p>Some plants, like pelargoniums, can only be kept handsomely formed and well
                    furnished by cutting them down severely every season, after the. blooming is
                    over. The plants should be prepared for this by keeping them rather dry at the
                    root, and after cutting they must stand with little or no water till the stems
                    heal over, and produce young shoots, or “break,” as it is technically termed.
                    The appearance of a specimen pelargonium properly pruned is shown in fig. 76, in
                    which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> shows a young plant, the head of which has been
                    taken off to form a cutting, and whose buds are ready to break into young
                    shoots. Three shoots will be produced, and these, after growing from 4 to 6
                    inches in length, should be stopped by pinching out the point, this giving rise
                    to lateral shoots. These will blossom in due course, and, after being ripened
                    thoroughly by full exposure to the sun, should be cut back as shown at <hi
                    rend="italic">l&gt;.</hi> This is the proper foundation for a good specimen, and
                    illustrates how all such subjects should be pruned to keep them stocky and
                    presentable in form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Root Pruning</hi> is most commonly practised in fruit tree
                    cultivation. It is often resorted to as a means of restoring fertility in plants
                    which have become over rank and sterile in growth. The effect of it, or of
                    transplanting, is to reduce the supply of crude sap to the branches, and
                    consequently to cause a check in their development. In rootpruning all roots
                    that have struck downwards into a cold uncongenial subsoil must be pruned off if
                    they cannot be turned in a lateral direction, and all the lateral ones that have
                    become coarse and fibreless must also be shortened back by means of a clean cut
                    with a sharp knife, while some hard rubbly material may if necessary be put
                    under the tree before it is again planted, all its roots being laid out
                    laterally, radiating as equally as possible from the centre. The operation is
                    best performed early in autumn, and may be safely resorted to in the case of
                    fruit trees of moderate age, and even of old trees if due care be exercised. In
                    transplanting trees all the roots which may have become bruised or broken in the
                    process of lifting should be cut clean away behind the broken part, as they then
                    more readily strike out new roots from the cut parts. In all these cases the cut
                    should be a clean sloping one, and made in an upward and outward direction.</p>
                <p>The root-pruning of pot-plants is necessary in the case of many soft-wooded
                    subjects which are grown on year after year—pelargoniums and fuchsias, for
                    example. After the close pruning of the branches to which they are annually
                    subjected, and when the young shoots have shot forth an inch or two in length,
                    they are turned out of their pots and have the old soil shaken away from their
                    roots, the longest of which, to the extent of about half the existing quantity,
                    are then cut clean away, and the plants repotted into small pots. This permits
                    the growing plant to be fed with rich fresh soil, without having been
                    necessarily transferred to pots of unwieldy size by the time the flowering stage
                    is reached.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ringing.—</hi> One of the expedients for inducing a state of
                    fruitfulness in trees, is the ringing of the branches or stem, that is, removing
                    a narrow annular portion of the bark, by which means, it is said, the trees are
                    not only rendered productive, but the quality of the fruit is at the same time
                    improved. The advantage depends on the obstruction given to the descent of the
                    sap. The ring should be cut out in spring, and be of such a width that the bark
                    may remain separated for the season. A tight ligature of twine or wire answers
                    the same end. The advantages of the operation may perhaps be gained by judicious
                    root pruning, and it is not at all adapted for the various stone fruits.</p>
                <p>26. <hi rend="italic">Training.—</hi> What is called training is the guiding of
                    the branches of a tree or plant in certain positions which they would not
                    naturally assume, the object being partly to secure their full exposure to
                    light, and partly to regulate the flow and distribution of the sap. To secure
                    the former object, the branches must be so fixed as to shade each other as
                    little as possible; and to realize the second, the branches must have given to
                    them an upward or downward direction, as they may require to be encouraged or
                    repressed. Something of the same vegetative vigour which is given to a plant or
                    tree by hard pruning is afforded by training in an upward direction so as to
                    promote the flow of the sap; while the repression effected by summer pruning is
                    supplemented by downward training, which acts as a check. One main object is the
                    preservation of equilibrium in the growth of the several parts of the tree; and
                    for this various minor details deserve attention. Thus a shoot will grow more
                    vigorously whilst waving in the air than when nailed close to the wall;
                    consequently a weak shoot should be left free, whilst its stronger antagonist
                    should be restrained; and a luxuriant shoot may be retarded for some time by
                    having its tender extremity pinched off to allow a weaker shoot to overtake
                    it.</p>
                <p>Mr Robert Thompson, who is to be regarded as an authority, says <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gardener's Assistant,</hi> 340) :—</p>
                <p>“A fair exposure to light is one of the principal objects to he borne in mind in
                    training; but the branches may be well regulated as regards exposure to light,
                    without being equally so with respect to the flow of sap. For instance, they may
                    be disposed like the radii of a circle touching the circumference at equal
                    distances (fig. 77, <hi rend="italic">na, l·b cc, v).</hi> We shall, however,
                    suppose that the central <pb break="no"

                    cut back nearly to its base in order to furnish from buds there situated the
                    rudiments of other branches. The sap flows with much greater force into the
                    upright or nearly upright branchesthan it does into those having a horizontal
                    position; therefore branches radiating at equal distances, like those in the
                    figure, would soon become very unequal in point of vigour; <hi rend="italic"
                    >cc</hi> would of course be strong, <hi rend="italic">an</hi> comparatively
                    weak, whilst <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> would maintain a somewhat intermediate
                    condition. If, instead of training the shoots cc in a straight direction, we
                    depress them at <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> and bend them in the growing season as
                    indicated by the curved line towards <hi rend="italic">bb,</hi> we shall greatly
                    check their over-luxuriance. On the other hand, by elevating the horizontal
                    shoots at cc, and training them in the direction of the dotted line towards <hi
                    rend="italic">bb,</hi> those shoots will be thereby greatly invigorated. In
                    short, by curving the upper branches downwards and the lower ones upwards, the
                    flow of sap is checked in the former and promoted in the latter; and the
                    consequence is that <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> and cc are equal to the medium <hi
                    rend="italic">bb</hi> and to each other.”</p>
                <p>By these and other expedients, and by the prudent use of the knife, fruit trees
                    may be readily trained into the forms indicated below, which are amongst the
                    best out of the many which have been devised.</p>
                <p>The training of standard and bush trees in the open ground has been already
                    referred to under the section <hi rend="italic">Pruning.</hi> When the growth of
                    pyramids is completed, the outline is something like that of fig. 78, and very
                    pretty trees are thus formed. It is better, however, especially if the tendency
                    to bear fruit is rather slack, to adopt what the French call <hi rend="italic"
                    >en quenouille</hi> training (fig 79), which consists in tying or weighting the
                    tips of the branches so as to give them all a downward curve. Pear trees worked
                    on the quince stock, and trained <hi rend="italic">en quenouille,</hi> are
                    generally very fertile.</p>
                <p>Wall trees, it must be evident, are placed in a very unnatural and constrained
                    position, and would in fact soon be reduced to a state of utter confusion, if
                    allowed to grow unrestricted; hence the following modes of training have been
                    adopted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Horizontal Training</hi> (fig. 80) has long been a favourite
                    form in England. There is one principal ascending stem from which the branches
                    depart at right angles, at intervals of about a foot. Horizontal training is
                    best adapted to the apple and the pear; and for the more twiggy growing slender
                    varieties, the forms shown in fig. 81 have been recommended. In these the
                    horizontal branches are placed wider, 18 to 20 inches apart, and the smaller
                    shoots are trained between them, either on both sides, as at α, or deflexed from
                    the lower side, as at <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The latter is an excellent
                    method of reclaiming neglected trees. Every alternate branch should be taken
                    away, and the spurs cut off, after which the young shoots are trained in, and
                    soon produce good fruit.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Fan Training</hi> (fig. 82) there is no leading stem, but
                    the branches spring from the base and are arranged somewhat like the spokes of a
                    fan. This mode of training is com monly adopted for the peach, nectarine,
                    apricot, and Morello cherry, to which it is best adapted. Though sometimes
                    adopted, it is not so well suited as the horizontal form for apples and pears,
                    because, when the branches reach the top of the wall, where they must be cut
                    short, a <hi rend="italic">tête</hi><hi rend="italic">de saule</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or hedge of young shoots, is inevitable. A
                    modification of the fan shape (fig. 83) is sometimes adopted for stone fruits,
                    such as the apricot. In this the object is to establish a number of mother
                    branches, and on these to form a series of subordinate members, chiefly composed
                    of bearing wood. The mother branches or limbs should not be numerous, but
                    well-marked, equal in strength, and regularly disposed. The side branches should
                    be pretty <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n257/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0257-0246"/> abundant, short, and not so vigorous as to rival
                    the leading members.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Half-fan</hi> mode of training, which is intermediate
                    between horizontal and fan training, is most nearly allied to the former, but
                    the branches leave the stem at an acute angle, a disposition supposed to favour
                    the more equal distribution of the sap. Sometimes, as in fig. 84, two vertical
                    stems are adopted, but there is no particular advantage in this, and a
                    single-stemmed tree is more manageable. The half-fan form is well adapted for
                    such fruits as the plum and the cherry; and, indeed, for fruits of vigorous
                    habit, it seems to combine the advantages of both the foregoing.</p>
                <p>Trees must be fixed to the walls and buildings against which they are trained by
                    means of nails and shreds, or in cases where it is desired to preserve the wall
                    surface intact, by permanent nails or studs driven in in regular order.
                    Sometimes the walls are furnished with galvanized wires, but this has been
                    objected to as causing cankering of the shoots, for which, however, painting is
                    recommended as a remedy, and which is also avoided, it is said, by crossing the
                    tying material between the wire and the wood, and so preventing them from coming
                    in contact. If they are adopted, the wires should be close to the wall to
                    prevent a cold draught between it and the tree. Care should be taken that the
                    ties or fastenings do not eventually cut into the bark as the branches swell
                    with increased age. When shreds and nails are used, cast wall nails and
                    “medicated shreds” are the best; the nails should be of small size for the young
                    shoots.</p>
                <p>For tying plants to trellises and stakes nothing is better than soft tarred
                    string. Osier ties are sometimes used for espaliers. The training in of summer
                    shoots on wall-trees is often done by means of slender twigs; indeed the
                    prunings of the trees themselves, stripped of their leaves, often serve the
                    purpose very well; the ends are tucked under the adjacent fixed shoots, the
                    young shoots to be fastened in being thus held close to the wall. Crooked shoots
                    should be straightened at the principal or winter training; this is done by
                    pulling the convex side towards the straight line desired by means of the tie or
                    shred, the next above and below being set so as to pull in the opposite
                    direction.</p>
                <p>In training greenhouse plants the young branches should be drawn outwards by
                    means of ties fastened to a string or wire under the pot-rim; the centre then
                    fills up, and slender stakes are used as required; but the fewer these are in
                    number the better. Climbers are trained from the bottom around or across
                    trellises, of which the cylindrical or the balloon-shaped, or sometimes the flat
                    oval or circular, are the best forms. The size should be adapted to the habit of
                    the plant, which should cover the whole by the time flowers are produced. Bast
                    fibre and raphia fibre are to be preferred for light subjects of this character,
                    as they can be split to any degree of fineness; but the latter is not durable
                    enough or strong enough for coarse-growing border flowers. Very durable
                    trellises for greenhouse climbers are made of slender round iron rods for
                    standards, having a series of hooks on the inner edge, into which rings of
                    similar metal are dropped j the rings may be graduated so as to form a broad
                    open top, or may be all of the same size, when the trellis will assume the
                    cylindrical form. Fig. 85 shows a pot specimen of clematis trained over a
                    balloon-shaped trellis.</p>
                <p>The training of bedding plants over the surface of the soil is done by small pegs
                    of birch wood or bracken, by loops of wire, or sometimes by loops of bast having
                    the ends fixed in the soil by the aid of the dibble. The object is to fill up
                    the blank space as quickly and as evenly as possible.</p>
                <p>27. <hi rend="italic">Forcing</hi> is the accelerating, by special treatment, of
                    the growth of certain plants, which are required to be had in leaf, in flower,
                    or in fruit before their natural season,—as, for instance, the leaves of mint at
                    Eastertide or the leafstalks of sea-kale and rhubarb at Christmas, the flowers
                    of summer in the depth of winter, or some of the choicest fruits perfected so
                    much before their normal period as to complete, with the retarded crops of
                    winter, the circle of the seasons.</p>
                <p>In the management of artificial heat for this purpose, a considerable degree of
                    caution is required. The first stages of forcing should, of course, be very
                    gentle, so that the whole growth of the plants may advance in harmony. A very
                    hot atmosphere would unduly force the tops, while the roots remained partially
                    or wholly inactive; and a strong bottom heat, if it did not cause injury by its
                    excess, would probably result in abortive growth.</p>
                <p>Any sudden decrease of warmth would be very prejudicial to the progress of
                    vegetation through the successive stages of foliation, inflorescence, and
                    fructification. But it is not necessary that one unvarying range of temperature
                    should be kept up at whatever pains or risk. Indeed, in very severe weather it
                    is found better to drop a little from the maximum temperature by fire heat, and
                    the loss so occasioned may be made good by a little extra heat applied when the
                    weather is more genial. Night temperatures also should always be allowed to drop
                    somewhat, the heat being increased again in the morning. In other words, the
                    artificial temperature should increase by day and decrease by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n258/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0258-0247"/> night, should rise in summer and fall in winter,
                    should, in short, imitate as nearly as possible the varying influence of the
                    sun.</p>
                <p>For the growth of flowers generally, and for that of all fruits, every ray of
                    light to be obtained in the dull winter season is required, and therefore every
                    possible care should be taken to keep the glass clean. A moist genial atmosphere
                    too is essential, a point requiring unremitting attention on account of the
                    necessity of keeping up strong fires. With moisture as with heat, the cultivator
                    must hold his hand somewhat in very severe or very dull weather; but while heat
                    must not drop so as to chill the progressing vegetation, so neither must the
                    lack of moisture parch the plants so as to check their growth.</p>
                <p>There are some few subjects which when forced do not require a light house. Thus
                    amongst flowers the white blossoms of the lilac, so much prized during winter,
                    are produced by forcing the plant in darkness. Rhubarb and sea-kale among
                    esculents both need to be forced in darkness to keep them crisp and tender, and
                    mushrooms also are always grown in dark structures. In fact, a roomy mushroom
                    house is one of the most convenient of all places for forcing the vegetables
                    just referred to. The lilac would be better placed in a dark shed heated to
                    about 60°, in which some dung and leaves could be allowed to lie and ferment,
                    giving off both a genial heat and moisture.</p>
                <p>One of the most important preliminaries to successful forcing is the securing to
                    the plants a previous state of rest. The thorough ripening of the preceding
                    season’s wood in fruit trees and flowering plants, and of the crown in perennial
                    herbs like strawberries, and the cessation of all active growth before the time
                    they are to start into new growth, are of paramount importance. The ripening
                    process must be brought about by free exposure to light, and by the application
                    of a little extra heat with dryness, if the season should be unfavourable; and
                    both roots and tops must submit to a limitation of their water supply. When the
                    ripening is perfected, the resting process must be aided by keeping the
                    temperature in which they await the forcing process as low as each particular
                    subject can bear.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Flowers.</hi></p>
                <p>28. <hi rend="italic">Flower Garden and Pleasure Grounds.</hi> —Wherever there is
                    a flower garden of considerable magnitude, and in a separate situation, it
                    should be constructed on principles of its own. The great object must be to
                    exhibit to advantage the graceful forms and glorious hues of flowering plants
                    and shrubs. Two varieties of flower gardens have chiefly prevailed in Britain.
                    In one the ground is turf, out of which flower-beds, of varied patterns, are
                    cut; in the other the flower-beds are separated by gravel walks, without the
                    introduction of grass. When the flower garden is to be seen from the windows, or
                    any other elevated point of view, the former is to be preferred; but where the
                    surface is irregular, and the situation more remote, and especially where the
                    beauty of flowers is mainly looked to, the choice should probably fall on the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>The situation of the flower garden must be influenced by the nature of the lawns,
                    and of the site of the mansion to which it is attached. Generally speaking, it
                    should not be at any great distance from the house; and in places where there is
                    no distant view of importance, it may be constructed under the windows. On the
                    other hand, when the park is spacious, and the prospects extensive and
                    picturesque, it is perhaps better that the flower garden should be at a little
                    distance from and out of sight of the house, but easy of access in any sort of
                    weather. In most cases, even when it is in the vicinity of the mansion, the
                    flower garden should for security against ground game and other intruders be
                    encircled with some sort of fence. In detached localities the fences may be made
                    sufficiently strong to prevent the intrusion of every species of vagrant; it is
                    not difficult to mask them with shrubs and trees. The style of the mansion
                    should determine that of the flower garden, and also its position. The flower
                    garden attached to an elaborate mansion, should, for the most part, occupy the
                    lawn on the south, the east, or the west front; and the carriage-entrance, where
                    possible, should be on the north front, the park extending nearly or quite up to
                    the front door. This arrangement must, however, sometimes be departed from in
                    consequence of the difficulties of providing a proper approach to the
                    entrance-door, and must also be regulated by the position of the principal
                    rooms, which should if possible command a view of the flower garden.</p>
                <p>When the garden is upon a large scale, and especially where a natural inclination
                    in the ground exists, or can be formed artificially, terraces and parapet walls
                    should be introduced, with flights of steps, and embellishments in connexion
                    with them, such as fountains, statuary, sculpture, &amp;c. Grass terraces alone
                    have a mean appearance in such a position. The parapet walls afford excellent
                    accommodation for half-hardy and beautiful flowering plants.</p>
                <p>With regard to flower-plots, when the figures are separated by turf, it is
                    necessary that the little lawns or glades should have a certain degree of
                    breadth, as nothing has a worse effect than overcrowding. A multitude of little
                    figures should also be avoided, as they produce the disagreeable effect well
                    named by Gilpin “spottiness.” In this sort of flower garden it is desirable that
                    a gravel walk should skirt at least one side of the principal figures, for in
                    the humid climate of Britain the grass would otherwise render them inaccessible
                    with comfort during a great part of the year. In those gardens where turf is
                    wholly or partly excluded, the compartments should be of a larger and more
                    massive character. Narrow borders, bounded by parallel straight lines and
                    concentric curves, should be avoided. The centres of the figures should be
                    filled with tall-growing shrubs, and even with an occasional low evergreen tree,
                    such as a yew or a holly. The walks, arranged in long concave curves, may
                    communicate here and there with one another. A dial, a few seats and arbours,
                    with an urn or two or a vase, may be introduced with good effect.</p>
                <p>The flower garden may include several different compartments. Thus, for example,
                    there is the “Rock Garden,” which should consist of variously grouped masses of
                    large stones, those which are remarkable for being figured by water-wearing, or
                    containing petrifactions or impressions, or showing something of natural
                    stratification, being generally preferred. In the cavities between the stones,
                    filled with earth, alpine or trailing plants are inserted, and also some of the
                    choicest flowers. In proper situations, a small pool of water may be introduced
                    for the culture of aquatic plants. In a suitable position one of the walks is
                    sometimes arched over with wire-work, and covered with ornamental climbing
                    shrubs, forming a delightful promenade in the glowing days of summer. A separate
                    compartment laid out on some regular plan is often set apart for roses, under
                    the name of the “Rosery.” A moist or rather a shady border, or a section of the
                    pleasure ground supplied with bog earth, may be devoted to what is called the
                    “American Garden,” which, as it includes the gorgeous rhododendrons and azaleas,
                    forms one of the grandest features of the establishment during the early summer,
                    while if properly selected the plants are effective as a garden of evergreens at
                    all seasons. The number of variegated and various-coloured hardy shrubs is now
                    so great that a most pleasant plot for a “Winter Garden” may be arrayed with
                    plants of this class, with which may be associated hardy subjects which flower
                    during that season or very early spring, as the Christmas rose, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0259-0248"/> amongst bulbs the crocus and snowdrop. Later on,
                    the spring garden department is a scene of great attraction; and some of the
                    gardens of this character, as those of Cliveden and Belvoir, are among the most
                    fascinating examples of horticultural art.</p>
                <p>29. <hi rend="italic">Lawns.—</hi> In the formation of lawns the ground must be
                    regularly broken up so that it may settle down evenly, any deep excavations that
                    may have to be filled in being very carefully rammed down to prevent subsequent
                    settlement. The ground must also be thoroughly cleared of the roots of all
                    coarse perennial weeds, and be worked to a fine tilth ready for turfing or
                    sowing. The more expeditious method is of course to lay down turf, which should
                    be free from weeds, and is cut usually in strips of 1 foot wide, 3 feet long,
                    and about an inch in thickness. This must be laid very evenly and compactly, and
                    should then be beaten down firmly with the implement called a turf-beater (fig.
                    86). When there is a large space to cover, it is much the cheaper plan to sow
                    the lawn with grass-seeds, and equally effective, though the sward takes longer
                    to thicken. It is of the utmost importance that a good selection of grasses be
                    made, and that pure seeds should be obtained. The following sorts can be
                    recommended, the quantities given being those for sowing an acre of ground

                <p>The seeds should be thoroughly mixed, and very evenly sown, after which the
                    surface should be raked over to bury them, and then rolled down while dry so as
                    to finish it off smooth and level. When thus sown, lawns require to be promptly
                    weeded. During the growing season established lawns should be mown at least once
                    a week. They should be occasionally rolled, and towards autumn they require
                    frequent sweepings to remove worm-casts.</p>
                <p>30. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hardy Annuals.</hi> —Annual plants are those which grow
                    up from seed, flower, ripen seed, and die in the course of one season— one year.
                    They are useful in the mixed garden, for though in some cases they are of short
                    duration, many of them are possessed of much beauty of hue and elegance of form.
                    Annuals may be divided into three classes :—the <hi rend="italic">hardy,</hi>
                    which are sown at once in the ground they are to occupy; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >half-hardy,</hi> which succeed best when aided at first by a slight hot bed,
                    and then transplanted into the open air; and the <hi rend="italic">tender,</hi>
                    which are kept in pots, and treated as greenhouse or stove plants, to which
                    departments they properly belong. Some of the more popular annuals, hardy and
                    half-hardy, have been very much varied as regards habit and the colour of the
                    flowers, and purchases may be made in the seed shops of such things as China
                    asters, stocks, Chinese and Indian pinks, larkspurs, phloxes, and others,
                    amongst which some of the most beautiful of the summer flowers may be found.</p>
                <p>The hardy annuals may be sown in the open ground during the latter part of March
                    or beginning of April, as the season may determine, for the weather should be
                    dry and open, and the soil in a free-working condition before sowing is
                    attempted. I n favourable situations ana seasons some of the very hardiest, as
                    Silene pendula, Saponaria, Nemophila, Cilia, &amp;c., may be sown in September
                    or October, and transplanted to the beds or borders for very early spring
                    flowering. Those sown in spring begin to flower about June. The patches, if left
                    to flower where they are sown, should be thinned out while young, to give them
                    space for proper development. It is from having ample room that pricked out
                    transplanted seedlings often make the finest plants. The soil should be rich and
                    light.</p>
                <p>The half-hardy series are best sown in pots or pans under glass in mild heat, in
                    order to accelerate germination. Those of them which are in danger of becoming
                    leggy should be speedily removed to a cooler frame and placed near the glass,
                    the young plants being pricked off into fresh soil, in other pots or pans or
                    boxes, as may seem best in each case. All the plants must be hardened off
                    gradually during the month of April, and may generally be planted out some time
                    in May, earlier or later according to the season.</p>
                <p>The class of tender annuals, being chiefly grown for greenhouse decoration,
                    should be treated much the same as soft-wooded plants, being sown in spring, and
                    grown on rapidly in brisk heat, near the glass, and finally hardened off to
                    stand in the greenhouse when in flower.</p>
                <p>We add a select list of some of the more distinct annuals desirable for general

                <p>The following annuals are entitled to separate notice :—</p>
                <p>31. The China <hi rend="italic">Aster</hi> (Callisteρhus chinensis). The groups
                    of asters are very numerous; but some of the best for ornamental gardening are
                    the chrysanthemum-flowered, the paeony-flowered, the crown or cockade, and the
                    globe-quilled, of each of which there are from six to a dozen distinct colours.
                    What are called crown asters have a white centre and dark crimson or purple
                    circumference, and are very beautiful. The colours range from white and blush
                    through pink and rose to crimson, and from lilac through blue to purple, in
                    various shades. These should be sown early in April in pans, in a gentle heat,
                    the young plants being quickly transferred to a cool pit, and there pricked out
                    in rich soil as soon as large enough, and eventually planted out in the garden
                    in May or June, in soil which has been well worked and copiously manured, where
                    they grow from 8 to 18 inches high, and flower in great beauty towards the end
                    of summer. They also make very handsome pot plants for the conservatory.</p>
                <p>32. The <hi rend="italic">Stock</hi> (Matthiola annua). These also are much
                    varied both in respect to habit and colour, and of some of the forms as many as
                    two dozen colours are cultivated, some of which are very beautiful. The Ten-week
                    and the large-flowered German are both favourite strains. The fragrance of these
                    flowers renders them universal favourites. They should be treated much the same
                    as asters for autumn-blooming plants, but for early blooming require to be sown
                    about August, ana wintered in pots in a cold frame, for which purpose the
                    Intermediate Stock is the best adapted (see <hi rend="italic">Biennials,</hi>
                    par. 41). They grow from 1 to 2 feet high, according to the variety.</p>
                <p>33. The <hi rend="italic">Snapdragon</hi> (Antirrhinum majus), which grows about
                    2 feet high, should be sown in February in a warm pit; prick oif in pots, and
                    subsequently into boxes, drawing off into a cool frame when established, and
                    planting out in May or June. They are not true annuals, but may be treated as
                    such.</p>
                <p>34. The <hi rend="italic">Chinese</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian Pink</hi>
                    (Dianthus chinensis, and its varieties Heddewigii and laciniatus) and several
                    allied forms, which grow from 6 inches to a foot high, are very richly coloured,
                    and highly varied in marking. Sow in pits in gentle heat, in March, transferring
                    them quickly after germination to a cool pit, that they may not get drawn or
                    leggy; they may be planted out in May. They will also flower later on in
                    favourable seasons, if sown outdoors early in April.</p>
                <p>35. The <hi rend="italic">Larkspur</hi> affords two distinct types, the Rocket
                    Larkspur (Delphinium Ajacis), which varies from a foot to a foot and a half, and
                    the branching Larkspur (D. Consolida), growing 3 feet high, of each of which
                    there are various colours, double and single. The candelabrum form of the latter
                    is very handsome. Sow in March in the open border where they are to flower.</p>
                <p>36. The <hi rend="italic">Phlox Drwnmondii,</hi> a spreading plant about a foot
                    high, of which there are now many varieties of colour,' is one of the most
                    beautiful of all annuals, and very prolific of blossom. Sow in the places where
                    it is to flower, in April, in good firm soil.</p>
                <p>37. The <hi rend="italic">Sweet Pea</hi> (Lathyrus odoratus) is indispensable in
                    every garden, especially Painted Lady (white and rose) and the improved forms
                    called Invincible Scarlet and Invincible Black. Sow in rows or patches in
                    February, and again in March, in good rich soil. The plants grow 3 to 4 feet
                    high, and require stakes to support the stems.</p>
                <p>38. The <hi rend="italic">Nasturtium</hi> (Tropaeolum majus), in its dwarf form
                    known as Tom Thumb (T. m. nanum), is an excellent bedding or border flower,
                    growing about a foot high, each plant forming a dense patch full of flowers, and
                    blooming on fδr a considerable period if kept growing. The scarlet, the yellow,
                    and the rose-coloured are very attractive. Sow in April in the beds or borders;
                    and again in May for a succession.</p>
                <p>39. The <hi rend="italic">Zinnia</hi><hi rend="italic">elegans,</hi> of which
                    both single and double) forms are cultivated, grows about 2 feet high, and
                    produces flowers of various colours, the double ones being about the size of
                    asters, and very handsome. The colours include white, yellow, orange, scarlet,
                    crimson, and purple. It is half-hardy, and should be sown and treated much the
                    same as the aster.</p>
                <p>40. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hardy Biennials.</hi> —Biennials live as undeveloped
                    plants through one winter period. They require to be sown in the summer months,
                    about June or July, in order to get established before winter; they should be
                    pricked out as soon as large enough, and should have ample space so as to become
                    hardy and stocky. They should be planted in good soil, but not of too
                    stimulating a character. Those that are perfectly hardy are best planted where
                    they are to flower in good time during autumn.'· This transplanting acts as a
                    kind of check, which is rather beneficial than otherwise. Of those that are
                    liable to suffer injury in winter, as the Brompton and Queen Stocks, a portion
                    should be potted and wintered in cold frames ventilated as freely as the weather
                    will permit.</p>
                <p>The number of biennials is not large, but a few very desirable garden plants,
                    such as the following, occur amongst them :—</p>
                <p>Agrostemma coronaria (Rose Campion): hardy, 1J ft., bright rose-purple or rose
                    and white.</p>

                    rend="italic">Stocks.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Intermediate Stock</hi>
                    (Matthiola annua intermedia) is one of the so-called scarlet stocks, and is very
                    useful, when preserved through the winter in frames, for its dwarfness and
                    early-flowering habit. It is used very extensively for furnishing jardinieres,
                    window boxes, flower beds, &amp;c., during the London season, for which purpose
                    it is sown in July and August, while if sown in spring it blooms in autumn, and
                    furnishes a usefill successional crop of flowers. Of the East Lothian stock,
                    which is a somewhat larger grower, there are some half dozen colours, those
                    called New Crimson and Mauve Beauty being specially admired; these are sown in
                    July and August for summer blooming, and early in spring for flowering in
                    autumn.</p>
                <p>42. The <hi rend="italic">Brompton Stock</hi> (Matthiola incana simplicicaulis)
                    is a robust plant, growing 3 feet high, with a long central flower stem bearing
                    very large flowers, which are crimson, purple, or white. They require rich soil,
                    and should be sown in June or July, being pricked out into nursery beds, and
                    planted in September in the borders where they are to bloom. Two or three plants
                    should be put in one patch, as then any surplusage of single-flowered
                    individuals may be pulled away.</p>
                <p>43. The <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Twickenham Slock</hi>
                    (Matthiola incana semperflorens) is less vigorous in habit than the Brompton,
                    and is of more spreading habit, the plants growing about2 feet high, with the
                    lateral branches very much developed. There are the three usual colours, purple,
                    scarlet, and white, the first-named being a special favourite. They require to
                    be sowm in June or July, and planted out in September, so as to get well
                    established before winter, and if they have the advantage of good soil they will
                    flower freely in the early part of the ensuing summer. Sometimes the plants
                    acquire almost a woody habit, and live over the second year, but the flowers are
                    not equal to those produced the first blooming season.</p>
                <p>44. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hardy Perennials.</hi> —This term includes, not only
                    those fibrbus-rooted plants of herbaceous habit which spring up from the root
                    year after year, but also those old-fashioned subjects known as florists’
                    flowers, and the hardy bulbs. Some of the most beautiful of hardy flowering
                    plants belong to this class, and their great variety, as well as the long period
                    through which they, one or other of them, yield their flowers, aie beginning
                    again to secure them some of the consideration which has long been given mainly
                    to bedding plants.</p>
                <p>When the length of the flowering season is considered, it will be obvious that it
                    is impossible to keep up the show of a single border or plot for six months
                    together, since plants, as they are commonly arranged, come dropping into flower
                    one after another; and even where a certain number are in bloom at the same
                    time, they necessarily stand apart, and so the effects of contrast, which can be
                    perceived only among adjacent objects, are lost. To obviate this defect, it has
                    been recommended that ornamental plants should be formed into four or five
                    separate suites of flowering, to be distributed over the garden. Not to mention
                    the more vernal flowers, the first might contain the flora of May; the second
                    that of June; the third that of July; and the fourth that of August and the
                    following months. These compartments should be so intermingled that no
                    particular class may be entirely absent from any one quarter of the garden.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0261-0250"/>
                <p>Before commencing to plant, it would be well to construct tables or lists of the
                    plants, specifying their respective times of flowering, colours, and altitudes.
                    To diversify properly and mingle well together the reds, whites, purples,
                    yellows, and blues, with all their intervening shades, requires considerable
                    taste and powers of combination; and ascertained failures may be rectified at
                    the proper time the next season. The one great object aimed at should be to
                    present an agreeable contrast; and, as at particular seasons a monotony of tint
                    prevails, it is useful at such times to be in possession of some strong glaring
                    colours. White, for instance, should be much employed in July, to break the
                    duller blues and purples which then preponderate. Orange, too, is very effective
                    at this season. On the other hand, yellows are superabundant in autumn, and
                    therefore reds and blues should then besought for. Thé flower-gardener should
                    have a small nursery, or reserve garden, for the propagation of the finer
                    plants, to be transferred into the borders as often as is required.</p>
                <p>As a rule, all the fibrous-rooted herbaceous plants flourish in good soil which
                    has been fairly enriched with manure, that of a loamy character being the most
                    suitable. Many of them also grow satisfactorily in a peaty soil if well worked,
                    especially if they have a cool moist subsoil. Pentstemons and phloxes, amongst
                    others, succeed well in soil of this character, but the surface must be well
                    drained; the former are rather apt to perish in winter in loamy soil, if at all
                    close and heavy. The herbaceous border should be a distinct compartment, and not
                    less than 10 feet in width, backed up by evergreens. Such a border will take in
                    about four lines of plants, the tallest being placed at the back and the others
                    graduated in height down to the front. In the front row patches of the white
                    arabis, the yellow alyssum, and the purple aubrietia, recurring at intervals of
                    5 or 6 yards on a border of considerable length, carry the eye forwards and give
                    a balanced kind of finish to the whole. The same might be done with dianthuses
                    or the larger narcissi in the second row, with paeonies, columbines, and phloxes
                    in the third, and with delphiniums, aconitums, and some of the taller yellow
                    composites as helianthus and rudbeckia at the back. Spring and autumn flowers,
                    as well as those blooming in summer, should be regularly distributed throughout
                    the border, which will then at no season be devoid of interest in any part. Many
                    of the little alpines may be brought into the front line planted between
                    suitable pieces of stone, or they may be relegated to a particular spot, and
                    placed on an artificial rockery. Most of the hardy bulbs will do well enough in
                    the border, care being taken not to disturb them while leafless and dormant.</p>
                <p>Some deep-rooting perennials do not spread much at the surface, and only require
                    refreshing from time to time by top-dressings. Others, as the asters, spread
                    rapidly; those possessing this habitshould be taken up every second or third
                    year, and, a nice patch being selected for replanting from the outer portions,
                    the rest may be either thrown aside, or reserved for increase; the portion
                    selected for replanting should be returned to its place, the ground having
                    meanwhile been well broken up. Some plants are apt to decay at the base,
                    frequently from exposure caused by the lifting process going on during their
                    growth; these should be taken up annually in early autumn, the soil refreshed,
                    and the plants returned to their places, care being taken to plant them
                    sufficiently deep.</p>
                <p>Only a selection of some of the best of the decorative hardy perennials can be
                    noted, before we pass on to those popular subjects of this class which have been
                    directly influenced by the hybridizer and improver. Many more might be added to

                    have a close family resemblance, the inflorescence being a panicle of white
                    drooping tulipshaped flowers, and the foliage rosulatc, sword-shaped, and
                    spear-pointed. Of the more shrubby-lιabited sorts Y. gloriosa, recurvifolia, and

                    Y. filamentosa, flaccida, and angustifolia are distinct and interesting kinds,
                    the first two flowering annually.</p>
                <p>The taste for cultivation of the class of plants of which the foregoing list
                    embraces the more prominent members is on the increase, and our gardens will
                    benefit by its extension; but we may hope that the folly of limiting the
                    interest of the flower garden to this class of subjects alone, to the exclusion
                    of the brilliant bedding flowers which have been evolved out of less showy
                    materials by the gardener’s skill, as some writers would seem to desire, may
                    never be realized.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to notice at greater length the more important plants of this
                    class,—those to which horticulturists have devoted the greatest attention, with
                    the result, in many cases, of largely increasing the varieties of these
                    “florists’ flowers.”</p>
                <p>45. The <hi rend="italic">Anemone</hi> (Anemone coronaria), often called the
                    Poppy Anemone, is a tuberous-rooted plant, with parsley-like divided leaves, and
                    large showy poppy-like blossoms on stalks of from 6 to 9 inches high; the
                    flowers are of various colours, but the principal are scarlet, crimson, blue,
                    purple, and white. There are also double-flowered varieties, in which the
                    stamens in the centre are replaced by a tuft of narrow petals. It is an old
                    garden favourite, and of the double forms there are named varieties. They grow
                    best in a loamy soil, enriched with well-rotted manure, which should be dug in
                    below the tubers. These may be planted in October, and for succession in
                    January, the autumn planted ones being protected by a covering of leaves or
                    short stable litter. They will flower in May and June, and when the leaves have
                    ripened should be taken up into a dry room till planting time. Anemones are
                    easily raised from the seed, and a bed of the single varieties is a valuable
                    addition to a flower-garden, as it affords, in a warm situation, an abundance of
                    handsome and often brilliant spring flowers, almost as early as the snowdrop or
                    crocus. The genus contains many other lively spring blooming plants, of which A.
                    hortensis and A. fulgens have less divided leaves and splendid rosy-purple or
                    scarlet flowers; they require similar treatment. Another set is represented by
                    A. Pulsatilla, the Pasque-flower, whose violet blossoms have the outer surface
                    hairy; these prefer a calcareous soil. The splendid A. japonica, and its white
                    variety called Honorine Jobert, rhe latter especially, are amongst the finest of
                    autumn blooming hardy perennials; they grow well in light soil, and reach 2⅜ to
                    3 feet in height, blooming continually for several weeks. A group of dwarf
                    species, represented by the native British A. nemorosa and A. apennina, are
                    amongst the most beautiful of spring flowers for planting in woods and shady
                    places.</p>
                <p>46. <hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">ιhe Antirrhinum</hi>
                    (Antirrhinum majus) is very easily managed. Sown in heat, and forwarded until
                    the general time for planting out, it becomes a summer annual, and may be so
                    treated (par. 33); but under a slower and more hardy regime it may be sown in
                    boxes in August, and pricked off into other boxes and wintered in a frame, for,
                    though not often destroyed, it sometimes suffers greatly in a severe season. So
                    treated, and planted out in well-prepared beds of good friable garden soil, it
                    will become very showy and effective, and if a good strain of seed has been
                    obtained many very beautiful kinds may generally be selected from the progeny.
                    The named sorts are propagated by cuttings, and wintered in a frame. Some of the
                    double-flowered sorts are interesting. There are forms with white, yellow, rose,
                    crimson, magenta, and variously mottled and striped flowers, some of them of
                    great beauty, but the named sorts are too fugitive to make it desirable to
                    record a list of them.</p>
                <p>47. <hi rend="italic superscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">Q Auricula</hi> (Primula Auricula), a
                    native of the Alps, has been an inmate of British gardens for about three
                    hundred years, and is still prized by florists as one of their choicest flowers.
                    The auricula loves a cool soil and shady situation. The florists’ varieties are
                    grown in rich composts, for the preparation of which numberless receipts have
                    been given; but many of the old nostrums are now exploded, and a more rational
                    treatment has taken their place. Thus Mr Douglas, themost recent authority,
                    writes <hi rend="italic">(Hardy Florists’ Flowers) :—</hi></p>
                <p>“There is no mystery, as some suppose, about the potting, any more than there is
                    about the potting material. The compost should consist of turfy loam four parts,
                    leaf-mould one part, sharp river or silver sand one part, and a few bits of
                    broken charcoal mixed with it. The pots to be used should be from 3 to 4⅛ inches
                    in diameter, inside measure; about 1 inch of potsherds should be placed in the
                    bottom of each pot, and over this some fibrous turf, from which the fine
                    particles of earth have been removed. The old soil should oe shaken from the
                    roots of the plants to be potted; and before potting cut off, if necessary, a
                    portion of the main root. In potting press the soil rather firmly around the
                    roots.”</p>
                <p>Auriculas are best grown in a cold frame mounted on legs about 2 feet from the
                    ground, and provided with hinged sashes. A graduated stage formed of wood
                    battens 6 inches broad, with a rise of 2 inches, should be fixed so as to take
                    each one row of pots, with the plants standing at about 15 inches from the
                    glass; the spaces between the shelves should be closed, while the top board of
                    the back and the front should be hinged so as to be. let down when desired for
                    ventilation, the sashes, too, being movable for the same purpose, and also to
                    afford facilities for examining and attending to the plants. This frame should
                    face the north, and stand under shelter of a wall or hedge. No protection will
                    be needed except in very severe frosts, when two or three thicknesses of garden
                    mats may be thrown over the glass, and allowed to remain on until the soil is
                    thawed, should it become frozen.</p>
                <p>Auriculas may be propagated from seed, which is to be sown as soon as ripe, in
                    July or August, in boxes, kept under cover, and exposed only to the rays of the
                    morning sun. When seed has been saved from the finer sorts, the operation is one
                    of considerable nicety, as it not unfrequently happens that the best seedlings
                    are at first exceedingly weak. They generally flower in the second or third
                    year, a few good sorts being all that can be expected from a large sowing. The
                    established varieties are increased by taking off the offshoots, an operation
                    which is performed at the time of potting in July or the beginning of
                    August.</p>
                <p>The original of the auricula is a hardy perennial herb, of dwarf habit, bearing
                    dull yellowish blossoms. This and the commoner forms raised from seed, as well
                    as one or two double forms, are interesting hardy border flowers. The choice
                    florists’ varieties are divided into five classes :—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >green-edged,</hi> with the margins of the flowers green; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >grey-edged,</hi> with the green margins powdered with meal so as to appear to
                    be coloured grey; the <hi rend="italic">white-edged,</hi> with the mealy powder
                    so dense as to cover the green; the <hi rend="italic">selfs,</hi> which have
                    none of the green variegation of margin seen in the foregoing, but are of some
                    distinct colour, as purple, maroon, &amp;c., but have, like the preceding, a
                    white paste surrounding the eye; and the <hi rend="italic">alpines,</hi> which
                    resemble the selfs in not having any green marginal variegation, but differ in
                    having a yellow centre more or less dense. The individual flowers of the first
                    three groups of florists’ auriculas show four distinct circles :—first the eye
                    or tube, which should have the stamens lying in it, but sometimes has the
                    pin-headed stigma instead, which is a defect; second, the. paste or circle of
                    pure white surrounding the eye; third, the body colour, a circle of some dark
                    tint, ns maroon or violet, which feathers oct more or less towards <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0265-0254"/> the edge, but is the more perfect the less it is
                    so feathered, and is quite faulty if it breaks through to the outer circle;
                    fourth, the margin, which is green or grey or white. These circles should be
                    about equal in width and clearly defined, and the nearer they are to this
                    standard the more perfect is the flower. In the group of selfs the conditions
                    are the same, except that there is no margin, and consequently the body colour,
                    which should be uniform in tone, extends to the edge. In the alpines there
                    should be no paste or white surrounding the eye, but this space should be either
                    golden-yellow or creamy-yellow, which makes two subdivisions in this group; and
                    the body colour is more or less distinctly shaded, the edges being of a paler
                    hue. There is besides a group of laced alpines, in which a distinct and regular
                    border of colour surrounds each of the marginal lobes.</p>

                <p>48. The <hi rend="italic">Carnation</hi> (Dianthus Caryophyllus), a native, <hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi> some suppose, of Italy, but occasionally found in an
                    apparently wild state in England, has long been held in high estimation as a
                    garden flower, not only for the beauty but for the delightful fragrance of its
                    blossoms. The varieties are numerous, and are ranged under three groups, called
                    <hi rend="italic">bizarres,</hi><hi rend="italic">fiakes,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">picotees.</hi> The last, from their distinctness of character, are
                    now generally looked upon as if they were a different plant, whereas they are,
                    in truth, but a seminal development from the carnation itself, their number and
                    variety being entirely owing to the assiduous endeavours of the modern florist
                    to vary and to improve them.</p>
                <p>The true carnations, as distinguished from picotees, are those which have the
                    colours arranged in longitudinal stripes or bars of variable width on each
                    petal, the ground colour being white. The <hi rend="italic">bizarres</hi> are
                    those in which stripes of two distinct colours occur on the white ground, and it
                    is on the purity of the white ground and the clearness and evenness of the
                    striping that the technical merit of each variety rests. There are scarlet
                    bizarres marked with scarlet and maroon, crimson bizarres marked with crimson
                    and purple, and pink and purple bizarres marked with those two colours. The <hi
                    rend="italic">flakes</hi> are those which have stripes of only one colour on the
                    white ground, and here we have purple flakes striped with purple, scarlet flakes
                    striped with scarlet, and rose flakes striped with rose colour. There are still
                    the <hi rend="italic">selfs,</hi> or those showing one colour only, as white,·
                    yellow, crimson, purple, &amp;c., and these are commonly called <hi
                    rend="italic">cloves.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">picotee</hi> differs from the carnation in having the
                    petals laced instead of striped with a distinct colour; the subgroups bear the
                    designations red-edged, purple-edged, rose-edged, and scarlet-edged, all having
                    white grounds; each group divides into two sections, the heavy-edged and the
                    light-edged respectively. In the heavy-edged sorts the colour appears to be laid
                    on in little touches, passing from the edge inwards, but so closely that they
                    coalesce into one line of colour from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ of an inch broad, and more or less feathered on the
                    inner edge, the less feathered the better; while the light-edged sorts display
                    only a fine edge, commonly called a wire edge, of colour on the white ground. To
                    these have to be added yellow picotees, a group of great beauty, but deficient
                    in correctness of marking.</p>
                <p>Even the choice varieties of the carnation or picotee may be very successfully
                    grown in most unfavourable localities; but the commoner sorts, such as may be
                    raised freely from seed, on account of their robust constitution, are perhaps to
                    be preferred for the ordinary flower garden; while the single-flowered sorts are
                    by no means to be despised, especially those having decided colours. It is by
                    selecting the best seedlings that new varieties of merit are produced. The
                    established varieties are propagated by layers or by pipings, the former plan
                    being adopted with strong healthy plants in an ordinarily congenial season. The
                    latter is sometimes had recourse to when the plants do not produce young shoots
                    of sufficient length to admit of their being layered; and the cuttings, planted
                    under close glasses in a bed where there is a very slight bottom heat, will
                    generally root. Layering is, however, a more expeditious mode. It is performed
                    at the time the plants are in flower, or as soon after as possible. The rooted
                    layers may be removed and potted or planted out towards the end of September, or
                    early in October, the choice sorts being potted in rather small pots and kept in
                    a cold frame during winter, at which season the great enemy to be guarded
                    against is damp.</p>
                <p>The soil for carnations and picotees should be a good turfy loam, free from
                    wireworm, and as fibry as it can be obtained; to four parts of this add one part
                    of rotten manure and one of leaf-mould, with sufficent sharp sand to keep it
                    loose. A moderate addition of old lime rubbish, if attainable, will also be an
                    advantage. This should be laid up in a dry place, and frequently turned over
                    with the fork or spade, so as to be in a free friable condition for use towards
                    the end of February or early in March. As to the size of the blooming pots, Mr
                    Douglas observes :—</p>
                <p>“I.do not care to use them larger than 10 inches in diameter, inside measure, and
                    three plants may be put into a pot that size; a 9-inch pot may be used for a
                    pair of a strong-growing sort, while weaker growers may be potted two in an
                    8-inch or even a 7-inch pot. If it is intended to propagate all the layers
                    produced, that must be taken into account, as the plants will not have so good a
                    chance in a small as in a large pot. After potting they should be kept in a
                    well-ventilated frame until established, and set in the open air in an open
                    sunny spot when the weather becomes genial, the flowering stems being tied up
                    carefully as they grow up. At the flowering season they should be put in a
                    thoroughly ventilated glass house, where they can be shaded from bright
                    sunshine, or under the protection of a canvas screen to keep off rain and sun.
                    Where there is any tendency in the flowers to burst the calyx on one side, the
                    other divisions should be slit down a little, and the calyx should have a
                    ligature, not too tight, of thread or matting; tms, if done early, will prevent
                    the petals falling aside and destroying the symmetry of the flower.”</p>
                <p>The groups are so numerous that to name a selection of the best sorts would
                    occupy too much space. Ample information on this head may be obtained from Mr
                    Douglas’s book already referred to <hi rend="italic">{Hardy Florists'
                    Flowers')</hi>; and critically descriptive lists of all the varieties then
                    grown, by the highest authority, Mr E. S. Dodwell, will be found in the volumes
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Florist and Pomologist</hi> for 1876 and 1877.</p>
                <p>49. The <hi rend="italic">Chrysanthemum</hi> (Chrysanthemum sinense) is one of
                    the ∣ most popular of autumn flowers. It is a native of China, whence ι it has
                    long been introduced. The small-flowered pompons, and the grotesque-flowered
                    Japanese sorts are of more recent date, the former having originated from the
                    Chusan daisy, a variety introduced by Mr Fortune in 1846, and the latter having
                    also been introduced by the same traveller about 1862. The plants may be
                    increased by division, in March or April, the divided portions being planted in
                    beds of rich soil, under the shelter of a wall or fence, as a safeguard against
                    cold and stormy weather. The shoots should be thinned out to about four or six
                    from each root, and these should be staked as they grow up. They look extremely
                    well in such a border, if arranged in two or three rows according to their
                    heights, and with a judicious intermixture of colours, the advantage of growing
                    them in this way being that a canvas screen can be put over them, by which means
                    they not only flower in greater perfection, but last for a longer period. They
                    are of the easiest culture, and may be grown readily enough even in town
                    gardens.</p>
                <p>The chrysanthemum is, however, of very great importance as a greenhouse plant for
                    autumn and winter flowering, and for this purpose, as well as for exhibition
                    culture, it is generally raised from cuttings, or suckers, which are taken off
                    by some growers about October, and planted singly in 3-inch pots, the plants
                    being wintered in cold frames, and shifted into larger-sized pots about March;
                    they are topped when about 6 inches high, and the young shoots thus induced are
                    again topped when 3 or 4 inches long. Others take short cuttings in March, and
                    strike them quickly in a mild hotbed, airing freely as soon as rooted, and
                    shifting and stopping as in the other case. As soon as fine weather sets in in
                    June, the plants, having received one or two previous shifts according to the
                    size which they are required to reach, should be plunged outdoors in a tolerably
                    open spot, and there carefully watered and syringed. About the middle of July
                    they should be shifted into their blooming pots, the pompons requiring less room
                    than the large-flowered and Japanese sorts, and after the end of July it is not
                    advisable to continue the topping—technically “stopping”—of the young shoots, as
                    it may interfere with the blooming. As soon as the flower-buds become visible,
                    the plants are benefited by a watering of weak liquid manure two or three times
                    a week. The pots should still be plunged in a bed of coal ashes or cocoa-nut
                    refuse, till about the end of September, when they should be put under glass as
                    a precaution against injury from autumn frosts, having, however, full
                    ventilation by day. Abundant root watering is necessary until the flowers are
                    developed, when the supply may be slightly diminished, and the atmosphere should
                    be kept dryish by abundant ventilation. The compost used for potting in all the
                    stages afterthe cuttings, for which any light earth will suffice, should consist
                    of four parts loam to one of rotten dung and one of leaf-mould, giving rather
                    more leaf-mould and less manure for the first potting, and rather more manure
                    for the last; a little coarsely-pounded gritty matter may be added
                    advantageously. For the large-flowered sorts 11-inch pots are large enough to
                    produce very handsome specimens, and 8-inch pots suffice for the pompons, but
                    very useful plants may be had in smaller pots than these. For fine specimen
                    flowers only a single shoot is allowed to grow up, and this goes on unstopped,
                    and finally develops two or three very large flowers; these latter require
                    disbudding, as some sorts give the best flowers from the terminal buds, others
                    from the side buds. The aphis or green fly is a great enemy to the plants, and
                    must be kept under; dusting the hearts of the shoots with tobacco powder is a
                    safe and efficient remedy; but, whatever be the method employed, it should be
                    applied before the blossoms open.</p>

                <p>Within the last few years a new type of dwarf-growing early-blooming varieties
                    has sprung up, and these are now increasing in number. They come into flower in
                    August and September, and are extremely useful for filling up exhausted beds in
                    the flower garden as well as for cutting. They are cultivated exactly as the
                    others. The following are useful sorts of this group :—Adrastus, Chroraatella,
                    Delphine Caboche, Frédéric Pelé, Madame Alphonse Dufoy, Madame Picoul,
                    Précocité, and Scarlet Gem.</p>
                <p>50. The <hi rend="italic">Crocus</hi> sets our gardens aglow with its bright
                    colours almost as soon as winter has departed. These crocuses of the flower
                    garden are mostly seminal varieties of C. vemus and C. aureus, the former
                    yielding the purple and striped, and the latter the yellow varieties. The
                    headquarters of the genus is in eastern Europe and Asia Minor, but C. vernus is
                    found wild in some parts of England. It has been much improved by Dutch
                    florists, and large quantities are annually imported from Holland. The crocus
                    succeeds in any fairly good garden soil, and is usually planted near the edges
                    of beds or borders in the flower garden, or in broadish patches at intervals
                    along the mixed borders. The roots or corms should be planted 3 inches below the
                    surface, and as they become crowded they should be taken up and replanted with
                    <hi rend="italic">â</hi> refreshment of the soil, at least every five or six
                    years. Crocuses have also a pleasing effect when dotted about on the lawns and
                    grassy banks of the pleasure ground. Some of the best of the varieties are
                    :—</p>

                    >Shaded light blue</hi>: Lilaceus superbus. <hi rend="italic">Blue tipped with

                    Gold.</p>
                <p>The species of Crocus are not very readily obtainable, but those who make a
                    speciality of hardy bulbs ought certainly to search them out and grow them. They
                    require the same culture as the more familiar garden varieties; but, as some of
                    them are apt to suffer from excess of moisture, it is advisable to plant them in
                    prepared soil in a raised pit, where they are brought nearer to the eye, and
                    where they can be sheltered -when necessary by glazed sashes,—which, however,
                    should not be kept closed except when the plants are at rest. The
                    autumn-blooming kinds include many plants of very great beauty.</p>
                <p>Of the spring-flowering species, there are C. aureus, Susianus, stellaris,
                    sulphureus, chrysanthus, mesiacus, Olivieri, and vitellinus, having yellow
                    flowers of various shades; C. vernus, etruscus, Imperati,minimus, suaveolens,
                    and veluchensis, with blue or lilac flowers; C. albiflorus, Fleischerianus,
                    versicolor, strictus, and biflorus, with white or whitish flowers. Of the
                    autumn-blooming species, there are C. speciosus, Clusianus, medius, Orpha-nidis,
                    longiflorus (odorus), Rallasii, Thomasii, Salzmannianus, nudiflorus, autumnalis,
                    serotinus, Sieberi, Cartwrightianus, and byzantinus, with lilac or purple
                    flowers; C. Boryauus, vallicola, hadriaticus, cancellatus, and Cambes-sedianus,
                    with white or whitish flowers; and C. Scharojani with flowers of a rich saffron
                    yellow.</p>
                <p>51. The C⅛∙ow7iZw^er⅛Z(Fritillariaimperialis) grows up to a height of about 3
                    feet, the lower part of the stoutish stem being furnished with leaves, while
                    near the top is developed a coronal of large pendent flowers surmounted by a
                    tuft of bright green leaves like those of the lower part of the stem, only
                    smaller. The flowers are bell-shaped, yellow or red, and in some of the forms
                    double. The plant grows freely in good garden soil, preferring a deep
                    well-drained loam, and is all the better for a top-dressing of manure as it
                    approaches the flowering stage. Strong clumps of five or six roots of one kind
                    have a very fine effect. It is a very suitable subject for the back row in mixed
                    flower borders, or for recesses in the front part of shrubbery borders. It
                    flowers in April or early in May. There are a few named varieties, but the most
                    generally grown are the single and double yellow, and the single and double red,
                    the single red haying also two variegated varieties, with the leaves striped
                    respectively with white and yellow.</p>
                <p>52.. The florists’ <hi rend="italic">Dahlia</hi> (Dahlia variabilis) yields two
                    groups or varieties, which are known as show and fancy dahlias,—the former
                    consisting of all self-coloured flowers and those light-ground ones which are
                    edged, tipped, or laced with a dark colour; the latter, all flowers with the
                    colour in stripes like a carnation, and all darkground flowers tipped with
                    white. Besides these there are bedding dahlia,s, which are dwarf-growing sorts
                    with decided colours, much used in flower-gardens where large effects are
                    required to be produced; and pompon dahlias, which are very symmetrical
                    small-flowered sorts, better adapted for cutting than the more bulky flowers of
                    the show varieties. The single-flowered D. coccinea, a most brilliant and highly
                    effective ornamental plant, with some other allied kinds, has recently attracted
                    much attention, and can be commended as an admirable half-hardy border flower,
                    and well adapted for cutting to fill large vases. It is rather more delicate
                    than the forms of D. variabilis, and the tuberous roots are very apt to be lost
                    during winter, but it is readily raised from seeds, and if sown early flowers
                    the same season. The varieties of the florists’ dahlia selected for the flower
                    garden should be those only which are of effective colours, whether selfs or
                    others, and such as throw out their flower heads or long stalks clear of the
                    foliage. The same remark applies to the pompons.</p>
                <p>New varieties are procured from seed, which should be sown in pots or pans
                    towards the end of March, and placed in a hotbed or propagating pit, the young
                    plants being pricked off into pots or boxes, and gradually hardened off for
                    planting out in June; they will flower the same season if the summer is a genial
                    one. The older varieties are propagated by dividing the large tuberous roots, in
                    doing which care must be taken to leave an eye to each portion of tuber,
                    otherwise it will not grow. Bare varieties are sometimes grafted on the roots of
                    others (see fig. 57, p. 237). The best and most general mode of propagation is
                    by cuttings, to obtain which, the old tubers are placed in heat in February, and
                    as the young shoots, which rise freely from them, attain the height of 3 inches,
                    they are taken off with a heel, and planted singly in small pots filled with
                    fine sandy soil, and plunged in a moderate heat. They root speedily, and are
                    then transferred to larger pots in light rich soil, and their growth encouraged
                    until the planting-out season arrives, which is about the middle of June.</p>
                <p>Dahlias succeed best in an open situation, and in rich deep loam, but there is
                    scarcely any garden soil in which they will not thrive, if it is manured. For
                    the production of fine show flowers the ground must be deeply trenched, and well
                    manured annually. The branches as well as the blossoms require a considerable
                    but judicious amount of thinning; they also need shading in some cases, and
                    individual protection from rain and wind. They may stand singly like common
                    border flowers, but have the most imposing appearance when seen in masses
                    arranged according to their height. Florists usually devote a plot of ground to
                    them, and plant them in lines 5 to 10 feet apart. This is done about the
                    beginning of June, sheltering them if necessary from late frosts by inverted
                    pots or in some other convenient way. Old roots often throw up a multitude of
                    stems, which render thinning necessary. As the plants increase in height, they
                    are furnished with strong stakes, to secure them from high winds. Dahlias flower
                    on till they are interrupted by frost in autumn. The roots are then taken up,
                    dried, and stored in a cellar, or some other place where they may be secure from
                    fros and moisture. See article <hi rend="smallcaps">Dahlia,</hi> vol. vi. p.

                <p>53. The <hi rend="italic">Delphinium,</hi> or Bee-Larkspur, is so called from the
                    resemblance of the petals in the original species, D. elatum, to the hairy body
                    of a bee. The original had comparatively small flowers, but by hybridizing they
                    have been very much increased in size, and improved in quality, and now
                    constitute one of the brightest ornaments of the mixed border, or the shrubbery
                    group, often throwing up secondary blooming stems, especially if the first are
                    removed in good time, instead of being allowed to form seeds. The colour varies
                    from reddish-blue to pale blue or grey, but the prevailing one is dark blue.
                    Delphiniums need a good rich soil, that of a loamy character being the best.
                    They must be replanted at least every second year, and the soil either renewed
                    or well manured and thoroughly broken up. Replanting may be done equally well
                    early in autumn or when growth recommences in spring. The commoner single
                    varieties, such as the brilliant D. formosum, may be reproduced with but slight
                    variation from seed, but the double ones must be propagated by division. Unless
                    sown as soon as ripe the seed is apt to take long to vegetate. If novelties are
                    required, the flowers can be cross-fertilized. F or mere propagation the best
                    method is division; for this purpose the stems should be cut down early, say in
                    July, the offsets potted each into a small pot of light soil, and wintered in a
                    frame. The plants should be well exposed to the sun, but sheltered from strong
                    winds, and promptly and carefully staked. In a mixed border they should be
                    planted in one of the back rows; but their spirelike inflorescence is very
                    effective when they are planted several together in a group or bed in the front
                    part of the shrubbery border. They vary in height from 3 to 6 feet. The
                    following are some of the best modern varieties :—</p>

                <p>54. The <hi rend="italic">Gladiolus,</hi> described separately in vol. x. p. 732,
                    has become one of our most popular flowers, and is a striking ornament of our
                    gardens during the late summer months. The modern race of flowers has sprung
                    from G. gandavensis, but others (see separate article) are grown to a smaller
                    extent, and come in at an earlier season. G. cardinalis, cruentus, and
                    floribundus belong to this latter series, and are pretty subjects for the mixed
                    borders, while for beds G. brenchleyensis, one of the early hybrids, is still
                    one of the most brilliant and effective, the flowers being of a glowing scarlet.
                    The choicer kinds afford a variety of colours, including white, yellow, blush,
                    rose, salmon, cerise, scarlet, crimson, and rosy-purple, many of them being
                    prettily striped or blotched. Being tall (3 to 4 feet), and spare of leaves,
                    they are most effective when planted in beds <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n267/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0267-0256"/> furnished below with some bushy foliage plants,
                    between which their spikes of brilliant flowers may appear; or they may be
                    planted in the mixed border, where clumps of half a dozen roots of one kind have
                    a much finer appearance than when they are dotted about singly.</p>
                <p> A deep sandy loam is the best soil for the gladiolus, and this should be
                    trenched up in. October and enriched with well-decomposed manure, consisting
                    partly of cow dung, the manure being disposed altogether below the bulbs, a
                    layer at the bottom of the upper trench, say 9 inches from the surface, and
                    another layer at double that depth. The bulbs (technically, corms) should be
                    planted in succession at intervals of two or three weeks through the months of
                    March, April, and May. They should be planted about 3 inches deep, a little pure
                    soil or sand being laid over each before the earth is closed in about them, an
                    arrangement which may be advantageously followed with bulbous plants generally.
                    In hot summer weather they should have a good mulching of half-rotten manure,
                    and, as soon as the flower spikes are produced, liquid manure may occasionally
                    be given them with advantage.</p>
                <p>The gladiolus is easily raised from seeds, which should be sown in March, in pots
                    of rich soil placed in heat, the pots being kept near the glass after they begin
                    to grow, and the plants being gradually hardened to permit their being placed
                    out-of-doors in a sheltered spot for the summer. In October they will have
                    ripened off, and must be taken out of the soil, and stored in paper bags in a
                    dry room secure from frost. They will have made little bulbs from the size of a
                    hazel nut downwards, (according to their vigour. In the spring they should be
                    planted like the old bulbs, and the larger ones will flower during the season,
                    while the smaller ones must be again harvested and planted out as before.</p>
                <p>The following are good varieties of their respective colours, but new varieties
                    are continually appearing, which have at least the merit of constitutional
                    vigour :—</p>

                    treated of in this volume (page 102), it only remains to add that, though it is
                    a perennial, it is not to be had in perfection unless a supply of young plants
                    is raised annually. The early part of August may be considered· as the season
                    for the blooming of the hollyhock.</p>

                <p>56. The <hi rend="italic">Hyacinth</hi> (Hyacinthus orientalis), noticed under
                    the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Hyacinth</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi> one
                    of the most beautiful and fragrant of the spring flowers, is a native of the
                    Levant, where it occurs abundantly, in form not unlike our common harebell. It
                    has long been a favourite in the East; but it has been brought to its present
                    artificial perfection in Holland, chiefly since the beginning of the last
                    century, and the bulbs are annually imported from Haarlem and its vicinity in
                    very large numbers.</p>
                <p>The hyacinth delights in a rich light sandy soil. The Dutch incorporate freely
                    with their naturally light soil a compost consisting of one-third coarse sea or
                    river sand, one-third rotten cow dung without litter, and one-third leaf-mould.
                    The soil thus renovated retains its qualities for six or seven years, but
                    hyacinths are not planted upon the same place for two years successively,
                    intermediary crops of narcissus, crocus, or tulips being taken. A good compost
                    for hyacinths is sandy loam, decayed leaf-mould, rotten cow dung, and sharp sand
                    in equal parts, the whole being collected and laid up in a heap and turned over
                    occasionally. Well drained beds made up of this soil, and refreshed with a
                    portion of new compost annually, would grow the hyacinth to perfection. The best
                    time to plant the bulbs is towards the end of October; they should be arranged
                    in rows, 8 inches asunder, there being four rows in each bed. The bulbs should
                    be sunk about 3 or 4 inches deep, with a small quantity of clean sand placed
                    below and around each of them. The beds should be covered with decayed tan-bark,
                    or half-rotten dung litter, and in severe weather may be covered with mats
                    supported on hoops, which may be continued at night when the plants have grown
                    up, but they should have full exposure to daylight. As the flower-stems appear,
                    they are tied to little rods to preserve them from accident. If the bulbs are at
                    all prized, the stems should be broken off as soon as the flowering is over, so
                    as not to exhaust the bulbs; the leaves, however, must be allowed to grow on
                    till matured, but as soon as they assume a yellow colour, the bulbs may be taken
                    up, the leavescut off near their base, and the bulbs laid out in a dry airy
                    shady place to ripen, after which they are cleaned of loose earth and skin,
                    ready for storing. It is the practice in Holland, about a month after the bloom,
                    or when the tips of the leaves assume a withered appearance, to take up the
                    bulbs, and to lay them sideways on the ground, covering them with an inch or two
                    of earth. About three weeks later they are again taken up and cleaned. In the
                    store-room the roots should be kept dry, well-aired, and apart from each
                    other.</p>
                <p>Few plants are better adapted than the hyacinth for pot culture as greenhouse
                    decorative plants; and by the aid of forcing they may be had in bloom as early
                    as Christmas. They flower fairly well in 5-inch pots, the stronger bulbs in
                    6-inch pots. To bloom at Christmas, they should be potted early in September, in
                    a compost resembling that already recommended for the open-air beds; and, to
                    keep up a succession of bloom, others should be potted at intervals of a few
                    weeks till the middle or end of November. The bulbs should be planted about
                    level with the soil, and if a little sand is put immediately around them so much
                    the better. The pots should be set in an open place on a dry hard bed of ashes,
                    and be covered over to a depth of 6 or 8 inches with the same material; and when
                    the roots are well developed, which will take from six to eight weeks, they may
                    be removed to a frame, and gradually exposed to light, and then placed in a
                    forcing pit in a heat of from 60° to 70°. When the flowers are fairly open, they
                    maybe removed to the greenhouse or conservatory.</p>
                <p>The hyacinth may be very successfully grown in glasses for ornament in dwelling
                    houses. The glasses are filled to the neck with rain water, a few lumps of
                    charcoal being dropped into them. The bulbs are placed in the hollow provided
                    for them, so that their base just touches the water. This may be done in
                    September or October. They are then set in a dark cupboard for a few weeks till
                    roots are freely produced, and then gradually exposed to light.</p>
                <p>There are both single and double-flowered varieties, but the single are generally
                    preferred, as the bells are arranged more closely, so that they form a better
                    spike than the doubles. A few good sorts are named below :—</p>

                <p>To these may be added the early-flowering single white Roman hyacinth, a
                    small-growing pure white variety, remarkable for its fragrance, and well adapted
                    for forcing, as it can be had in bloom if required by November. For windows it
                    grows well in the small glasses commonly used for crocuses; and for decorative
                    purposes should be planted about five bulbs in a 5-inch pot, or in pans holding
                    a dozen each. If grown for cut flowers it can bo planted thickly in boxes of any
                    convenient size.</p>
                <p>57. The <hi rend="italic">Iris</hi> family includes a large number of kinds of
                    various habit and character, all of them being plants of exceeding beauty, and
                    remarkable for their brilliant colours, and for having the three outer segments
                    of their flowers reflexed. There are two well-distinguished groups called the
                    bulbous and the rhizomatous. The hardier bulbous irises, including the Spanish
                    iris (I. Xiphium), and the English iris (I. xiphioides), require to be planted
                    in thoroughly drained beds in very light open soil, moderately enriched, and
                    should have a rather sheltered position. Both these present along series of
                    beautiful varieties of the most diverse colours, flowering in June and July, the
                    smaller Spanish iris being the earlier of the two. There are many other smaller
                    species of bulbous iris. Being liable to perish from excess of moisture, they
                    should have a well-drained bed of good but porous soil made up for them, in some
                    sunny spot, and in winter should be protected by a 6-inch covering of
                    half-decayed leaves or fresh cocoa-fibre refuse. To this set belong I. persica,
                    reticulata, filifolia, Histrio, juncea, and others.</p>
                <p>The herbaceous perennial irises, known commonly as the flag irises, are for the
                    most part of the easiest culture; they grow in any good free garden soil, the
                    smaller and more delicate species only needing the aid of turfy ingredients,
                    either peaty or loamy, to keep it light and open in texture. The earliest to
                    bloom are the forms of Iris pumila, which blossom during March, April, and May,
                    and are quite dwarf in habit. I. susiana and I. iberica, with singularly mottled
                    flowers, also dwarf in habit, bloom in April and May; and during the latter
                    month and the following one most of the larger species, such as I. germanica,
                    florentina, pallida, variegata, amoena, flavescens, sambucina, neglecta,
                    ruthenica, &amp;c., produce their gorgeous flowers. Of many of the foregoing
                    there are, besides the typical form, a considerable number of named garden
                    varieties.</p>
                <p>The beautiful Japanese Iris Kaempferi is of comparatively modern introduction,
                    and though of a distinct type is equally beautiful with the better known
                    species. In their outer segments they are rather spreading than deflexed,
                    forming an almost circular flower, which becomes quite so in some of the very
                    remarkable duplex varieties, in which six of these broad segments are produced
                    instead of three. Of this too there are numberless varieties cultivated under
                    names. They require a sandy peat soil, on a cool moist subsoil.</p>

                <p>58. The <hi rend="italic">Lily</hi> (Lilium) is a very popular family of hardy
                    bulbous flowers, and one which takes a high position in public estimation. The
                    species are very handsome, and some of them have long been grown. They are so
                    numerous and varied that no general cultural instructions will be alike suitable
                    to all. Some species, as L. Martagon, candidum, chalcedonicum, Szovitzianum, and
                    others, will grow in almost any good garden soil, and succeed admirably in loam
                    of a rather heavy character. L. chalcedonicum has an especial dislike to peat,
                    which on the other hand suits the tiger lily (L. tigrinum) well, and is
                    indispensable for the beautiful American L. superbum and canadense. The choice
                    and more delicate species, such as the grand L. auratum, speciosum, and Krameri,
                    which have come to us in recent times from Japan, the Californian L. Humboldtii,
                    par-dalinum, &amp;c., and the splendid hybrid L. Parkmanni, are more particular
                    as to soil, and require a deep bed of mixed turfy loam and peat, with plenty of
                    sharp grit, and a cool moist bottom. The margin of rhododendron beds, where
                    there are sheltered recesses amongst the plants, suit many of the more delicate
                    species well, partial shade and shelter of some kind being essential. The bulbs
                    should be planted about 6 inches below the surface, which should at once be
                    mulched over with half-decayed leaves or cocoafibre to keep out frost.</p>
                <p>Dr Wallace, who has paid much attention to the culture of these plants, remarks,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Notes on Lilies,</hi> that—</p>
                <p>“Lilies require, so far as their roots are concerned, a cool bottom, abundant
                    moisture, and for most kinds a free drainage.” He also recommends to “plant
                    deeply, say 6 to 8 inches, so that the roots may easily get into a moist
                    subsoil, and be sheltered from the scorching drying influence of the sun's rays,
                    to plant early in the autumn, so that the roots may be at work all the winter,
                    and to plant in a cool shady border, not exhausted by the roots of trees, where
                    the roots may always obtain moisture, and yet not be saturated.”</p>
                <p>The noble L. auratum, with its large white flowers^ having a yellow band and
                    numerous red or purple spots, is a magnificent plant when grown to perfection;
                    and so are the varieties called rubro-vittatum and cruentum, which have the
                    central band crimson instead of yellow. Of L. speciosum, also Japanese, the true
                    typical form and the red-spotted and white varieties are grand plants for late
                    summer blooming in the conservatory. The tiger lily, L. tigrinum, and its
                    varieties Fortunei, splendidum, and flore-pleno, are amongst the best species
                    for the flower garden, L. Thunbergi-anum and its many varieties being also good
                    border flowers. The pretty L. Leichtlinii and colchicum, with drooping yellow
                    flowers, and the scarlet drooping-flowered L. tenuifolium make up, with those
                    already mentioned, a series of the finest hardy flowers of the summer garden.
                    The Indian L. giganteum is perfectly distinct in character, having broad
                    heart-shaped leaves, and a noble stem 10 feet high, bearing a dozen or more
                    large deflexed, funnel-shaped, white, purple-stained flowers; and the Chinese L.
                    cordifolium is similar in character, but dwarfer in habit.</p>
                <p>For pot culture, the soil should consist of three parts turfy loam to one of
                    leaf-mould and thoroughly rotted manure, adding enough pure grit to keep the
                    mass porous. If leaf-mould is not at hand, turfy peat may be substituted for it.
                    The plants should be potted in October. The pots should be plunged in a cold
                    frame and protected from frost, and about May may be removed to a sheltered and
                    moderately shady place out-doors to remain till they flower, when they may be
                    removed to the greenhouse. This treatment suits the gorgeous L. auratum, the
                    splendid varieties of L. speciosum, and also the chaste-flowering trumpet-tubed
                    L. longiflorum and its varieties.</p>
                <p>59. The <hi rend="italic">Lobelia</hi> is familiar in gardens under two very
                    different forms, that of the dwarf-tufted plants used for summer bedding, and
                    that of the tall showy perennials. Of the former the best type is L. Erinus,
                    growing from 4 to 6 inches high, with many slender steins, bearing through along
                    period a profusion of small but bright blue twolipped flowers. That which is
                    called speciosa offers the best strain of the dwarf lobelias, but the actual
                    varieties are being constantly superseded by new sorts. A good variety will
                    reproduce itself sufficiently true from seed for ordinary flower borders, but
                    for formal bedding arrangements it is necessary to secure exact uniformity by
                    propagating from cuttings.</p>
                <p>The herbaceous lobelias, of which L. fulgens may be taken as the type, may be
                    called hardy except in so far as they suffer from damp in winter; they throw up
                    a series of short rosette-like suckers round the base of the old flowering stem,
                    and these sometimes, despite all the care taken of them, rot off during winter.
                    The roots should either be taken up in autumn, and planted closely side by side
                    in boxes of dry coal ashes, these being set for the time they are dormant either
                    in a cold frame or in any airy place in the greenhouse; or they may be left in
                    the ground, in which case a brick or two should be put beside the plants, some
                    coal ashes being first placed round them, and slates to protect the plants being
                    laid over the bricks, one end resting on the earth beyond. About February they
                    should be placed in a warm pit, and after a few days shaken out and the suckers
                    parted, and potted singly into small pots of light rich earth. After being kept
                    in the forcing pit until well established, they should be moved to a more airy
                    greenhouse pit, and eventually to a cold frame preparatory to planting out. They
                    should have a loamy soil, well enriched with manure; they require copious
                    waterings when they start into free growth. These tall-growing lobelias make
                    good pot plants, for which purpose the suckers should be parted and the strong
                    ones only potted singly in autumn; they should be placed in a warm pit to induce
                    them to root freely, transferred when well established to an airy greenhouse
                    shelf, and shifted on frequently during spring till they occupy pots a foot in
                    diameter. The soil should be a very rich loam, top-dressing being given when
                    they are coming into flower, and a very free supply of water is essential. They
                    may be raised from seeds, which, being very fine, require to be sown carefully;
                    but they do not flower usually till the second year except they are sown very
                    early in heat. A few good sorts are—Carminata, Distinction, Excellent,
                    Peach-blossom, Ruby, and Victoria Regina.</p>
                <p>60. The <hi rend="italic">Narcissus</hi> is a garden flower of great beauty and
                    considerable variety of form. The species are all bulbous plants of low stature,
                    and are with few exceptions perfectly hardy. There are five well-marked
                    sections.</p>
                <p>The Hoop-petticoat Narcissi, sometimes separated as the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corbularia,</hi> are not more than from 3 to 6 inches in height, and possess
                    grassy foliage and yellow or white flowers. These nave the coronet in the centre
                    of the flower very large in proportion to the other parts, and much expanded,
                    like the old hooped petticoats. The common hoop-petticoat, N. Bulbocodium, has
                    comparatively large bright yellow flowers; N. tenuifolius is smaller and
                    somewhat paler; N. citrinus is paler and larger; while N. monophyllus is white.
                    The small bulbs should be taken up in autumn and replanted in January or
                    February, according to the state of the season. They bloom about March or April.
                    The soil should be free and open, so that water may pass off readily.</p>
                <p>A second group is that of the Pseudo-Narcissi, constituting the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Ajax</hi> of some botanists, of which the daffodil, N.
                    Pseudo-Narcissus, is the type. In this the corona is also very large and
                    prominent, but is more elongated and trumpet-shaped. Of this group the most
                    striking species perhaps is N. bicolor, which has the perianth almost white, and
                    the coronet deep yellow; it yields two line varieties, Horsfieldii and Empress.
                    N. cernuus (moschatus) and N. cernuus plenus are double and single forms of a
                    cream-coloured species of great beauty; and besides these there are N.
                    lobularis, nobilis, obvallaris, Telamonius, maximus, and others, amongst the
                    most stately of the species, besides N. minor and minimus, which are miniature
                    repetitions of the daffodil. All these grow well in good garden soil, and
                    blossom from March onwards, coming in very early in genial seasons.</p>
                <p>Another group, the Mock Narcissi, with coronets of medium size, includes the fine
                    varieties of N. incomparabilis, one of which is known as butter-and-eggs, N.
                    poculiformis (montanus), N. odorus and odorus minor (Queen Ann’s jonquil), N.
                    juncifolius, and others. The hardier forms of this set thrive in the open
                    border, but the smaller sorts, like Queen Ann’s jonquil, are better taken up in
                    autumn, and replanted in February; they bloom freely about April or May.</p>
                <p>The Polyanthus Narcissi form another well-marked group, whose peculiarity of
                    producing many flowers on the stem is indicated by the name. In these the corona
                    is small and shallow as compared with the perianth. Some of the hardier forms,
                    as N. Tazetta itself, the type of the group, succeed in the open borders in
                    light well-drained soil, but the bulbs should be deeply planted, not less than 6
                    or 8 inches below the surface, to escape risk of injury from frost. Many
                    varieties of this form of narcissus are grown. They admit of being forced into
                    early bloom, like the hyacinth and tulip. They vary with a white creamy or
                    yellow perianth, and a yellow, lemon, primrose, or white cup or coronet; and,
                    being richlyfragrant, they are general favourites amongst spring flowers. The
                    jonquils, noticed above, as well as the double white narcissus, are also grown
                    in pots for early flowering; and the polyanthus narcissi are sometimes used for
                    bedding out in the spring garden. The following varieties are good :—Bazelman
                    major, Gloriosa, Sir Isaac Newton, white with yellow cup; Grand Monarque and
                    White Pearl, white with pale yellow cup; Paper White, pure white, early;
                    Bathurst, Perle d’Amour, and Sulphurine, yellow with yellow or orange cup; and
                    Grand Primo, a very fine yellow. These are planted or potted about October, and
                    treated in the same way as the hyacinth.</p>
                <p>There remains another little group, the Pheasant’s-eye Narcissi (N. poeticus), in
                    which the perianth is large, spreading, and conspicuous, and the coronet or cup
                    very small and shallow. These pheasant’s-eye narcissi, of which there are
                    several species or well-marked varieties, as N. radiiflorus, poetarum, recurvus,
                    &amp;c., blossom in succession during April and May, and all do well in the open
                    borders as permanent hardy bulbs. N. biflorus, the primrose peerless, a
                    two-flowered whitish yellow-cupped species, is equally hardy and easy of
                    culture; N. gracilis is yellow-flowered and blooms later, as does the
                    yellow-flowered N. Jonquilla, better known as the jonquil, of which there are
                    single and double flowered varieties, the latter species being a great
                    favourite.</p>
                <p>61. The <hi rend="italic">Paeony</hi> is a remarkably showy plant, of which two
                    very distinct types occur in gardens :—one the stout-growing herbaceous <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n269/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0269-0258"/> perennials, with fleshy tnberiform roots and.
                    annual stems, which have sprung mainly from Paeonia albiflora and P.
                    officinalis; the other called the tree paeony, stiff growing plants with
                    half-woody permanent stems, which have sprung from the Chinese P. Moutan.</p>
                <p>The herbaceous paeonies usually grow from 2 to 3 feet in height, and have large
                    much-divided leaves, and ample flowers of varied and attractive colours, and of
                    a globular form in the double varieties which are those most prized in gardens.
                    They blossom about the months of May and June as well as later in the summer,
                    and as ornaments for large beds in pleasure grounds, and for the front parts of
                    shrubberies, few flowers equal them in gorgeous effect. A good loamy soil—rather
                    light than heavy—suits them best, and a moderate supply of manure is beneficial.
                    They are impatient of frequent transplantings or repeated divisions for purposes
                    of propagation, but when necessary they may be multiplied by this means, care
                    being taken that a sound bud is attached to each portion of the tuberous
                    roots.</p>
                <p>The older varieties of P. albiflora include candida, festa, fragrans, Humei,
                    Pottsii, Reevesii, rubescens, vestalis, Whitleyi, &amp;c.; those of P.
                    officinalis embrace albicans, anemoniflora, Baxteri, blanda, rosea, Sabini,
                    &amp;c. The garden varieties of modem times are, however, still more beautiful,
                    the flowers being in many instances delicately tinted with more than one colour,
                    such as buff with bronzy centre, carmine with yellowish centre, rose with orange
                    centre, white tinted with rose, &amp;c. We name a selection of a few of the
                    light and dark coloured sorts, the former including tinted whites and yellows,
                    and the latter crimsons, roses, pinks, &amp;c. :—</p>

                <p>The Siberian P. tenuifolia, with finely-cut leaves, and crimson flowers, is a
                    graceful border plant, and its double-flowered variety is perhaps the most
                    elegant of its race.</p>
                <p>The Moutans or Tree Paeonies are remarkable for their subshrubby habit, forming
                    vigorous plants sometimes attaining a height of 6 to 8 feet, and producing in
                    April or May magnificent flowers which vary in colour from white to lilac,
                    purple, and rose. These are produced on the young shoots, which naturally bud
                    forth early in the spring, and are in consequence liable, unless protected, to
                    be cut off by spring frosts. They require to be thoroughly ripened in summer,
                    and therefore a hot season and a dryish situation are desirable for their
                    well-being; and they require perfect rest during winter. Small plants with a
                    single stem, if well matured so as to ensure their blossoming, make very
                    attractive plants when forced. They are increased by grafting in autumn on the
                    roots of the herbaceous paeonies.</p>
                <p>Of the older varieties the most conspicuous is papaverifolia, while the following
                    are of more recent acquisition Atrosanguinea, globosa, lilacina, picta,
                    Reevesiana, salmonea, and versicolor. Other garden varieties are— Gloria

                    also called heartsease, has sprung from the native British Viola tricolor, which
                    has probably been crossed with some of the allied species of this large and
                    varied genus. The modem varieties of the pansy consist in the main of three
                    types :—the show varieties; the fancy varieties, obtained a few years ago from
                    Belgium, and now very much improved; and the bedding varieties, which are
                    free-blooming sorts marked rather by effectiveness of colour in the mass than by
                    quality in the individual flower. The latter are extremely useful in spring
                    flower gardening.</p>
                <p>The pansy flourishes in well enriched garden soil, in an open but cool situation,
                    a loamy soil being preferable. Cow dung is the best manure. The established
                    sorts are increased by cuttings, whilst seeds are sown to procure novelties. The
                    cuttings, which should consist by preference of the smaller growths from the
                    centre of the plant, may be planted early in September, in sandy soil,· under a
                    hand light or in boxes under glass, and as soon as rooted should be removed to a
                    fresh bed of fine sandy soil. The seeds may be sown in August or September. The
                    bed may be prepared early in September, to be in readiness for planting, by
                    being well manured with cow dung and trenched up to a depth of 2 feet. The
                    plants should be planted in rows at about a foot apart. In spring they should be
                    mulched with half-rotten manure, and the shoots as they lengthen should be
                    pegged down into this enriched surface to induce the formation of new roots. If
                    the blooms show signs of exhaustion by the inconstancy of their colour or
                    marking, all the flowers should be picked off, and this top-dressing and pegging
                    down process performed in a thorough manner, watering in dry weather, and
                    keeping as cool as possible. Successional beds may be put in about February, the
                    young plants being struck later, and wintered in cold frames. The fancy pansies
                    require similar treatment, but are generally of a more vigorous
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>When grown in pots in a cold frame, about half a dozen shoots filling out a
                    6-inch pot, pansies are very handsome decorative objects. The cuttings should be
                    struck early in August, and the plants shifted into their blooming pots by the
                    middle of October; a rich open loamy compost is necessary to success, and they
                    must be kept free of aphides. Both the potted plants and those grown in the open
                    beds are benefited by the use of liquid manure.</p>
                <p>The bedding pansies possess a dwarf compact free-branched habit of growth, which
                    results in the production of a constant succession of flowers. They are a hardy
                    race, flowering freely from the early spring onwards. These, with the varieties
                    of Viola lutea and Viola cornuta, have latterly acquired great prominence from
                    their utility in furnishing early flowers for the spring garden, and novelties
                    are being rapidly produced.</p>
                <p>63. <hi rend="italic">The Pentstemon.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Many species
                    of Pentstemon have been introduced to our gardens, and rank amongst the finest
                    of all the herbaceous perennials. The pentstemon of the florist has, however,
                    sprung from P. Hartwegii, a suffruticose species, which has been more or less
                    hybridized with P. gentianoides, P. Cobaea, and possibly some others. The plants
                    are not absolutely hardy, but endure English winters unharmed in favoured
                    situations. They are freely multiplied by cuttings, selected from the young side
                    shoots, planted early in September, and kept in a close cold frame or under a
                    hand light till rooted. They should then be potted singly in small pots, and
                    wintered in a cold frame, the pots being plunged in ashes or cocoa-nut refuse,
                    in order to keep the soil from drying too rapidly, and to prevent the frost from
                    injuring the young roots. To obtain strong plants, they should be shifted into
                    5-inch pots early in March, and kept growing in well-ventilated frames until
                    May. They flower freely in July and August and onwards till cut down by frosts.
                    Smaller plants may be had by leaving the cuttings in the cutting pot during the
                    winter, and introducing them to the propagating pit in February or March, when
                    their young shoots can be taken off, struck, potted, and grown on in frames till
                    about May. Seedlings, if raised in heat in February or early in March, and
                    pricked out and forwarded under glass till May, will flower the same year, but
                    probably not so early as those raised from cuttings.</p>
                <p>The following are good kinds, and varied in colour and character, but new ones
                    appear every season, and sometimes show a marked advance on the older
                    sorts:—Andrew Hunter, Apollon, Countess of Eglinton, Bon Villageois, Col. Long,
                    The Bride, Dr St Paul, John F. Kinghorn, John M ’ Pherson, Lady Coutts Lindsay,
                    Molière, Mrs A. Sturry, W. P. Laird, Le Khédive, Black Knight, Stanstead Rival,
                    Souvenir de St Paul, Georges Sand.</p>
                <p>64. The <hi rend="italic">Phlox,</hi> with its modern improvements, constitutes
                    one of the finest of hardy herbaceous plants. There are two types—the
                    pyramidalis or early-flowering sorts, which appear to grow best in the northern
                    districts, and the decussata or late-flowering sorts, which are taller and are
                    those most frequently grown in English gardens.</p>
                <p>The early-flowering phloxes are increased by division of the root or by cuttings
                    which may be obtained about the middle or end of March, and strike readily under
                    a hand glass. They should be grown in beds, and will make good blooming plants
                    for the following year. The older or blooming plants should be grown in beds of
                    deep rich loamy soil, mulched with half-rotten dung as they come on towards
                    flowering. They should have abundance of water in dry weather. It is not
                    advisable to allow more than five stems to grow up to flower. The varieties of
                    this section flower a month or six weeks earlier than those of the decussata
                    group, and are at the height of their bloom in July.</p>
                <p>A few good sorts are—Duchess of Atħole, Lady Napier, Miss Robertson, Perfection,
                    Waverley, Stella, Alexandra, Iona, Marquis, James Mitchell, Elvina, James
                    Neilson, Miss Hunter, Bayard, Purple Emperor, Mauve Queen.</p>
                <p>The late-flowering phloxes may be raised either from cuttings or by division.
                    From cuttings in early spring vigorous young plants may be obtained which flower
                    well the following season. By division of the older plants into separate rooted
                    portions, plants are obtained which flower well the same year. The latter
                    require a deeply trenched soil, thoroughly manured, and should be well watered
                    in dry weather; indeed, as they grow up to bloom, manure water may be given
                    judiciously with advantage.</p>
                <p>A good selection of these are—A. F. Barron, Liervalli, Lothair, Roi des Roses,
                    Lucien Tisserand, Madame la Comtesse de Turenne, Madame Domage, Menottii, Mons.
                    H. Low, Coccinea, Mrs Laing, Rêve d’Ör, Marie Saisson, Madame Thibaut, Madame
                    Roempler, Gloire de Neuilly, J. K. Lord, La Candeur, Mons. Malet, Chanzy, Queen
                    of Whites.</p>
                <p>65. The <hi rend="italic">Pink</hi> of the garden has resulted from the
                    cultivation and improvement of Dianthus plumarius. The pink is a great favourite
                    with florists, those varieties being preferred which have the margin of the
                    petals entire, and which are well marked in the centre with bright crimson or
                    dark purple. Its grassy but glaucous foliage is much like that of the carnation,
                    but the whole plant is smaller, and the greater portion of the colouring of the
                    flowers forms a blotch near the base of the petal, instead of being laid on in
                    stripes as in the carnation, or confined to the outer edge as in the
                    picotee.</p>
                <p>Pinks require a free loamy soil deeply trenched, and well enriched with cow dung.
                    They are readily increased by pipings (fig. 60, <hi rend="italic">d),</hi> taken
                    off during the flowering period, and planted in light soil <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0270-0259"/> under a hand light, or in the open ground in a
                    shady situation; they may be planted an inch apart in rows 2 or 3 inches
                    asunder, and should be pressed firmly into the soil. When rooted, which will be
                    about August, they should be planted 4 inches apart in a nursery bed, where they
                    may remain till the latter part of September or the early part of October. The
                    chief attention required during winter is to press them down firmly should they
                    become lifted by frosts, and in spring the ground should be frequently stirred
                    and kept free from weeds. As the flowering stems grow up they should be
                    supported by sticks, and when the buds appear they should be assisted to burst
                    regularly by tying a soft ligature round them. The pink is also raised from
                    seeds, not only to obtain new varieties, but to keep up a race of vigorous
                    growing sorts. The seeds maybe sown in March or April, in pots in a warm frame,
                    and the young plants may be pricked off into boxes and sheltered in a cold
                    frame. They should be planted out in the early part of the summer in nursery
                    beds, in which, if they have space, they may remain to flower, or the alternate
                    ones may be transplanted to a blooming bed in September or the early part of
                    October; in either case they will bloom the following summer. These will grow in
                    any good garden soil, but the richer it is the better.</p>
                <p>There is also a number of varieties which are useful for forcing during the early
                    spring months. These are propagated from early pipings, and groλvn in nursery
                    beds, being taken up in October, and potted in a rich loamy compost, and w
                    intered in a cold pit till required for the forcing house. The varieties named
                    Anne Boleyn, Lady Blanch, Lord Lyons, Mrs Pettifer, and Coccinea are good useful
                    forcing sorts.</p>
                <p>Of choice florists’ varieties the number is not very large. The following would
                    form a good selection Turner’s Boiard, Dr Masters, Dr Maclean, Shirley Hibberd,
                    Lord Kirkaldy, Godfrey, and Bertram; Maclean’s Annie, Beauty, John Ball, and New
                    Criterion; Marris’s Excelsior and Vesta; Kirtland’s Rev. G. Jeans; Bragg’s
                    Nonpareil and Goliath; and Hooper’s Beauty of Bath.</p>
                <p>66. The <hi rend="italic">Polyanthus</hi> is one of the oldest of the florists’
                    flowers, and is no doubt an umbellate form of the primrose, Primula vulgaris.
                    For some time it has been held in low repute, but is now coming into greater
                    favour, and novelties are being slowly produced. The florists’ polyanthus has a
                    golden margin, and is known as the gold laced polyanthus, the properties. being
                    very distinctly laid down and rigidly adhered to. The chief of these are—a clear
                    unshaded blackish or reddish ground colour, an even margin or lacing of yellow
                    extending round each segment and cutting through its centre down to the ground
                    colour, and a yellow band surrounding the tube of exactly the same hue as the
                    yellow of the lacing. The plants are quite hardy, and grow best in strong loamy
                    sou, tolerably well enriched with dung and leaf-mould; they should be planted
                    about October. Plants for exhibition present a much better appearance if kept
                    during winter in a cold well-aired frame. Of these, Cheshire Favourite, Earl of
                    Lincoln, and Criterion, with black grounds, and Exile, Lancer, and Sunrise, with
                    red grounds, are amongst the best.</p>
                <p>For the flower borders what are called fancy polyanthuses are adopted. These are
                    best raised annually from seed, the young crop each year blooming in succession.
                    The seed should be sown as soon as ripe, the young plants being allowed to stand
                    through the winter in the seed bed. In April or May they are planted out in a
                    bed of rich garden soil, and they will bloom abundantly the following spring. A
                    few of the better thrum-eyed sorts should be allowed to ripen seed; the rest may
                    be thrown away.</p>
                <p>67. The <hi rend="italic">Potentilla,</hi> as a specialty, is a flower of modern
                    times. The double-flowered varieties are especially remarkable for their
                    ornamental qualities. A soil of a good loamy staple, enriched with rotten dung,
                    will grow the potentilla to perfection. They may be increased, though not very
                    freely, by parting them into as many pieces as there are crowns, the side
                    growths being those which can usually be thus separated. This may be done in
                    autumn or spring, and the plants will generally bloom the following season. The
                    plants like an open situation, and are well suited for filling a small or
                    moderatesized bed, as the foliage is of a neat and pleasing character when the
                    plants are not in bloom.</p>
                <p>The following are good named sorts :—Chromatella, Le Vésuve, Louis Van Houtte,
                    Meteor, Pluton, Vulcan, Le Dante, Mars, Nigra, Caméléon, Fénelon, Etna.</p>
                <p>68. The <hi rend="italic">Double Primrose</hi> is closely allied to the
                    polyanthus. There are some very handsome varieties grown, as the crimson, white,
                    yellow, purple, blue, and others. These all succeed under the treatment given to
                    the choicer kinds of polyanthus (par. 66).</p>
                <p>69. The <hi rend="italic">Pyrethrum</hi> is quite a modern garden flower,
                    extremely useful as blooming in the early summer months, and remarkable for its
                    neat habit and the great variety of character and colour which it presents. The
                    type forms are the P. roseum and P. carneum of botanists, hardy perennials, with
                    finely cut leaves, and large flowerheads, having in the one case a ray of deep
                    rose-coloured and in the other of flesh-coloured ligulate florets surrounding
                    the centre or disk. They bloom during the months of May and June, as well as
                    later on, and are always most welcome ornaments for the flower borders, and
                    useful for cutting for decorative purposes.</p>
                <p>The pyrethrum grows best in soil of a loamy texture; this should he well manured
                    and deeply trenched up before planting, and should be mulched in the spring by a
                    surface dressing of half-decayed manure. The plants may be increased by
                    division, the side shoots being taken off early in autumn with a portion of
                    roots attached. They may be placed either in separate beds or in the mixed
                    floweι border as may be required. In beds they can be supplemented as the season
                    passes on by the intermixture of later-blooming subjects, such as gladioli.
                    Slugs are often destructive to the young shoots. Seeds should be sown in spring
                    in a cold frame, and the young plants should be put out into beds when large
                    enough, and should flower the following May.</p>
                <p>The following will make a useful selection of sorts Aurora, Bonamy, Boule de
                    Neige, Brilliant, carminatum plenum, Charles Baltet, delicatum, Emile Lemoine,
                    floribundum plenum, Gloire d’Italie, Hermann Stenger, Iveryanum, La Vestale, Le
                    Dante, Madame Billiard, Minerva, Ne plus ultra, Prince of Wales, Solfaterre,

                <p>70. The <hi rend="italic">Ranunculus</hi> (R. asiaticus), a native of the Levant,
                    is one of the older florists’ flowers, which has sported into numberless
                    varieties, but was formerly held in much greater esteem than it is at the
                    present time. According to the canons of the florists, the flowers, to be
                    perfect, should be of the form of two-thirds of a ball, the outline forming a
                    perfect circle, with the centre close, the petals smooth-edged, the colour
                    dense, and the marking uniform.</p>
                <p>The ranunculus requires a strong and moist soil, with a fourth of rotten dung.
                    The soil should be from 18 inches to 2 feet deep, and at about 5 inches below
                    the surface there should be placed a stratum 6 or 8 inches thick of tw
                    o-year-old rotten cow dung, mixed with earth, the earth above this stratum,
                    where the roots are to be placed, being perfectly free from fresh dung. The
                    tubers are planted in rows 5 or 6 inches apart, and 3 or 4 inches separate in
                    the rows, the turban sorts in October, the more choice varieties in February.
                    They should be so close that the foliage may cover the surface of the bed. The
                    autumn-planted roots must be sheltered from frost by old tan or sifted coal
                    ashes. The plants when in flower should be covered with an awning; when the
                    leaves wither, the roots are to be taken up, dried, and stored. The ranunculus
                    is readily propagated from seed obtained from semi-double sorts, which are often
                    of themselves very beautiful flowers. It is generally sown in boxes in autumn or
                    spring. The young plants thus raised flower often in the second, and always in
                    the third year.</p>
                <p>The turban varieties, which are very showy for the borders, are of a few positive
                    colours, as scarlet, yellow, brown, carmine, and white. The florists’ varieties
                    have been bred from the Persian type, which is more delicate.</p>

                <p>71. The <hi rend="italic">Tulip</hi> (Tulipa Gesneriana) is a native of the East,
                    whence it was introduced into Europe about the middle of the 16th century. About
                    the year 1635 its culture was very <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> engrossing;
                    and, indeed, the rage for possessing rare sorts had become so great in Holland
                    as to give rise to a strange species of gambling, known to the collectors of
                    literary and scientific anecdotes by the name of Tulipo-mania. At present,
                    though not to be met with in every garden, the finer tulips have yet some ardent
                    cultivators, while certain varieties, as the early Due Van Thol and its allies,
                    and the double tulips ,of the Tournesol type, are much used for general garden
                    decoration, and for forcing. The latter, however, spring from other species of
                    the genus.</p>
                <p>The florists’ varieties of tulips, which have sprung from Tulipa Gesneriana, are
                    arranged in separate classes named bizarres, bybloemens, and roses, according to
                    their colour and marking. Tulips are readily raised from seeds, and the
                    seedlings w hen they first flower are of one colour,—that is, they are
                    self-coloured. Judged by the' florists’ rules, they are either good or bad in
                    form, and pure or stained (white or yellow) at the base; the badly formed and
                    stained flowers are thrown away, while the good and pure are grown on, these
                    being known as “breeder” tulips. The breeder bulbs and their offsets may grow on
                    for years producing only self-coloured flowers, but after a time, which is
                    varied and indefinite, some of the progeny “break,” that is, produce flowers
                    with the variegation which is so much prized. The flower is then said to be
                    “rectified”; it is a <hi rend="italic">bizarre</hi> when it has a yellow ground
                    marked with purple or red, a <hi rend="italic">bybloemen</hi> when it has a
                    white ground marked with violet or purple, or a <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> when
                    it has a white ground marked with rose colour. One of the most important of the
                    properties of a fine florists’ tulip is that the cup should form, when expanded,
                    from half to a third of a hollow ball, the divisions of the perianth being six
                    in number, broad at the ends, and smooth at the edges, so that the divisions may
                    scarcely show an indenture. Another is that the ground colour should be clear
                    and distinct, whether white or yellow. The least stain at the base of the
                    flower, technically called the “bottom,” would render a tulip comparatively
                    valueless. What are called feathered flowers are those which have an even close
                    feathering, forming an unbroken edging of colour all round, flamed flowers being
                    those which have a beam or bold mark down the centre, not reaching to thθ bottom
                    of the cup. Some flowers are both <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0271-0260"/> feathered and flamed, and in all cases the colour
                    must be uniformly-distributed.</p>
                <p>Tulips are usually grown in beds, which should be made up, to the depth of about
                    2 feet, with a rich compost of about four parts loam to one of leaf-mould and
                    one of thoroughly decomposed manure, which should have been well mixed some time
                    before required for use. The bottom of the bed must be thoroughly drained, and
                    so arranged that the water may not only soak down to the bottom, but find egress
                    there. New soil is not required every year, but it should be deeply turned up
                    and laid in ridges, and every third year it should be renewed to about a foot in
                    depth, and the new soil well mixed with the old. The bed should be in an open
                    but sheltered position, and should be got ready in September or early in
                    October, the bulbs being planted in October or early in November, 6 inches
                    apart, and 3 or 4 inches deep. The bed should be 4 feet wide— sufficient to take
                    seven rows of bulbs, a little river sand being placed about each. An awning
                    should be placed over the bed when the buds show colour, in order to lengthen
                    the duration of the flowers, and removed when the flowers fade. After the
                    flowers have fallen, the seed-vessels are broken off close by thé stem, to
                    prevent the plant from exhausting itself in perfecting seed, and to direct its
                    energies to the forming of the new bulb, and when the leaves and stalks turn
                    brown the bulbs are taken up and laid out for a few days in a cool airy place,
                    when they should be stored in drawers till planting time, being occasionally
                    examined in case any of them decay.</p>
                <p>Tulips are readily propagated by offsets, which are taken off from the parent
                    bulbs, and nursed in separate beds till they be full grown. New varieties are
                    raised from seed, and are from five to seven years old before they flower.</p>

                    —Much of the beauty of the pleasure garden depends upon the proper selection and
                    disposition of ornamental trees and shrubs. It is to be regretted that this
                    department of the garden is often greatly neglected, and the many ornamental
                    subjects introduced during the last half century are too frequently overlooked
                    by planters and garden artistes. We can only afford space here for lists of some
                    of the better and more useful and ornamental trees and shrubs, old and new,
                    supplemented by a brief notice of the rhododendron and its congeners, and of the
                    rose.</p>
                <p>The following list, which is not exhaustive, furnishes material from which a
                    selection may be made to suit various soils and situations. The shrubs marked *
                    are climbers.</p>

                <p>73. <hi rend="italic">The Rhododendron.—</hi> In places where the soil is
                    suitable, the rhododendron, on account of its flowering qualities, is fast
                    taking the place of the laurel in the mixed shrubbery. This plant, with its
                    associates the azalea, kalmia, andromeda, and the like, requires, generally
                    speaking, a peaty soil, and a cool, rather moist situation; but, though a peaty
                    soil is preferable, especially for the choice kinds, it is not essential. When,
                    however, the soil is loamy, it must have incorporated with it a liberal portion
                    of leaf-mould and decayed manure, cow dung being preferable, and, if at all
                    heavy, some clean road grit. The plants do not thrive in soil which contains
                    calcareous matter.</p>
                <p>These subjects, in view of the source of most of the originals, are commonly
                    called American plants; and a separate plot (called the American garden) is
                    often set apart for them. For such a plot the catawbiense type of rhododendron
                    is preferable, being hardier, producing better foliage, and comprising many of
                    the finest flowering sorts. Such varieties as Sir Thomas Sebright, Old Port, Mrs
                    Heneage, Michael Waterer, H. W. Sargent, Alexander Dancer, Brayanum, Scipio,
                    Everestianum, Minnie, Mrs John Clutton, J. Marshall Brooks, Sigismund Rucker,
                    Mrs Milner, and fastuosunι flore-pleno, may be counted on as sterling sorts,
                    which will always give satisfaction. The varieties of Azalea, though deciduous
                    in habit, are desirable on account of their brilliant and effective colours, and
                    with them may be associated such subjects as Andromeda, Cassandra, Leucothoe,
                    Dabeocia, Daphne Cneorum, the hardy Heaths, Gaultheria, Kalmia, Ledum,
                    Pernettya, Rhodora, Vaccinium, and Zenobia.</p>
                <p>74. <hi rend="italic">The Rose.—</hi> The rose is so universal a favourite that
                    some portion of the garden must necessarily be devoted to it, if the situation
                    be at all favourable. Roses will not, however, thrive in the vicinity of large
                    towns, since they require a pure air, and do not endure a smoky atmosphere. The
                    best soil for them is a deep rich strong loam free from stagnant moisture. Very
                    light sandy or gravelly soils, or soils which are clayey and badly drained, are
                    not suitable, and both must be greatly improved if rose-growing on them is
                    attempted. Light soils would be improved by a dressing of strong loam in
                    conjunction with cow dung or nightsoü; the latter, provided it is properly
                    prepared and not too fresh, is indeed the very best manure for roses in all but
                    soils which are naturally very rich. Heavy soils are improved by adding burned
                    earth or gritty refuse, with stable manure and leaf-mould or cocoa-fibre refuse;
                    and damp soils must necessarily be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n272/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0272-0261"/> drained. Roses require a constant annual supply
                    of manure, and, if this is given as a mulching in autumn, it serves to protect
                    their roots through the winter. They also require liberal supplies of water
                    during the growing season, and especially to be kept clear of aphides and other
                    insect pests, which may be done by dusting them with snuff while moist, and
                    washing it off with the syringe next day, or by syringing with dilute tobacco
                    water or some of the many insecticides now provided to facilitate this rather
                    troublesome task.</p>
                <p>Some growers prefer roses grown on their own roots, some on the Manetti, and
                    others on the brier stock. There is this to be said in favour of their own roots
                    that, if the tops are killed down by accident or by severe weather, the roots
                    will usually throw up new shoots true to their kind, which cannot be looked for
                    if they are worked, though it is sometimes recommended to plant deep in order
                    that the rose itself may learn to do without its foster parent the stock. Too
                    often, however, in the case of persons unfamiliar with roses, the choice rose
                    dies, and the stock usurps its place.</p>
                <p>An open situation, not shaded, but sheltered from strong winds, is what the rose
                    prefers. October and November are the best months for planting the hardy kinds.
                    The tender varieties are better laid in in a sheltered place, and the planting
                    deferred till March or April. In regard to pruning, roses vary considerably,
                    some requiring close cutting and others only thinning out; some again may be
                    safely pruned in autumn, and others are better left till spring. Instructions on
                    this point as to the several groups of varieties will be found in most rose
                    catalogues.</p>
                <p>Where dwarf beds of roses are required, a good plan is to peg down to within
                    about 6 inches from the ground the strong one year old shoots from the root. In
                    due time blooming shoots break out from nearly every eye, and masses of flowers
                    are secured, while strong young shoots are thrown up from the centre,. the plant
                    being on its own roots. Before winter sets in the old shoots which have thus
                    flowered and exhausted themselves are cut away, and three or four or more of the
                    strongest and best ripened young shoots are reserved for pegging down the
                    following season, which should be done about February. In the meantime, after
                    the pruning has been effected, plenty of good manure should have been dug in
                    about the roots. Thus treated, the plants never fail to produce plenty of strong
                    wood for pegging down each succeeding season.</p>
                <p>75. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bedding Plants.</hi> —This term is chiefly applied to
                    those summer-flowering plants, such as pelargoniums, petunias, dwarf lobelias,
                    verbenas, &amp;c., which are employed in masses for filling the beds of a
                    geometrical parterre. Of late years, however, more attention has been bestowed
                    on arrangements of brilliant flowering plants with those of fine foliage, and
                    the massing also of hardy early-blooming plants in parterre fashion has been
                    very greatly extended. Bedding plants thrive best in maiden soil, and therefore
                    the beds should be occasionally wholly or partly renovated with fresh earth. A
                    light loam, liberally manured with thoroughly rotten dung from an old hotbed or
                    thoroughly decomposed cow droppings and leafmould, forms the best kind of
                    compost, but in the case of free-growing plants, like pelargoniums,
                    over-richness must be avoided.</p>
                <p>76. <hi rend="italic">Spring Bedding. —</hi> For this description of bedding,
                    hardy plants only must be used; but even then the choice is tolerably extensive.
                    For example, there are the Alyssums, of which A. saxatile and A. gemonense are
                    in cultivation; Antennaria tomentosa; Arabis albida; Aubrietias, of which the
                    best sorts are A. Campbelliae and A. grandifiora; the double Bellis perennis or
                    Daisy; the Wallflowers, including Cheiranthus Cheiri (the Common Wallflower), C.
                    alpina, and C. Marshallii; Hepaticas, the principal of which are the varieties
                    of H. triloba, and the blue H. angulosa; Iberis or Candytuft; Lithospermum
                    fruticosum; Myosotis or Forget-me-not, including Μ. alpestris, Μ. dissitiflora,
                    Μ. azorica, and Μ. sylvestris; Phloxes, like P. subulata, with its varieties
                    setacea, Nelsoni, nivalis; the singleflowered varieties of the Primrose, Primula
                    vulgaris; Pyrethrum Parthenium aureum, called Golden Feather; Sempervivum
                    calcareum; the pink-flowered Silene pendula; self-coloured varieties of the
                    Pansy, V. tricolor, and of V. lutea and V. comuta, as well as some recent
                    hybrids. Besides these there are the various spring-flowering bulbs, such as the
                    varieties of Hyacinthus, Tulipa, Narcissus, Fritillaria, Muscari or Grape
                    Hyacinth, Crocus, Scilla, and Galanthus or Snowdrop.</p>
                <p>77. <hi rend="italic">Summer Bedding.—</hi> There is great variety amongst the
                    plants which are used for bedding out in the garden during the summer months,
                    but we can note only some of the most important of them. Amongst them are the
                    Ageratums, the old tall-growing sorts of which have been superseded by dwarfer
                    varieties, as Imperial Dwarf and Swanley Blue; Alternantheras, the principal of
                    which are A. amoena, amoena spectabilis, magnifica, paronychioides major aurea,
                    and amabilis; Alyssum maritimum variegatum; some of the named varieties of
                    Antirrhinum majus, especially the dwarf varieties; Arundo Donax variegata;
                    Begonias; Calceolarias; Cannas; Centaurea ragusina; Clematises, of which the
                    hybrids of the Jackmanni type are best; Dahlia variabilis, and the
                    single-flowered forms of D. coccinea; Echeverias, of which E. secunda and E.
                    metallica ure much employed; Gazanias; Heliotropium peruvianum; Iresine; the
                    Lantanas; Lobelias; Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum; Pelargoniums, of
                    which the various classes of zonal or bedding varieties are unapproachable for
                    effect and general utility; Petunias; Phloxes; Polemonium coeruleum variegatum;
                    Pyrethrum Parthenium aureum, especially useful as an edging to define the
                    outline of beds upon grass; Tropaeolums, especially some of the varieties of T.
                    Lobbianum; and Verbenas, the offspring of Tweediean;·, chamaedrifolia, and
                    others. Few bulbs come into the summer flower gardens, but amongst those which
                    should always be well represented are the Gladiolus, the Lilium, and the
                    Tigridia.</p>
                <p>78. <hi rend="italic">Subtropical Bedding.—</hi> A fewyearsago the late Mr John
                    Gibson, then superintendent of Battersea Park, introduced the style of planting
                    known as subtropical gardening, from the use that is made &lt;&gt;t subtropical
                    plants. In the climate of London and the south and west of England this new
                    feature proved very successful, but less so in the north of England and in
                    Scotland, except in very favoured localities. These subtropical materials may be
                    used either in masses of one kind, or in groups arranged for contrast, or as the
                    centres of groups of less imposing or of dwarfer-flowering subjects; or they may
                    be planted as single specimens in appropriate open spaces, in recesses, or as
                    distant striking objects terminating a vista. Some of the finest of these plants
                    of bold and striking habit are found in theAralia orFatsia, the Wigandia, the
                    Montagnaea, the Uhdea, and the Ferdinanda; Aralia japonica and papyrifera are
                    very fine, and so are Wigandia caracasana and Vigieri, Montagnaea heracleifolia
                    (also known as Polymnia grandis), Uhdea bipinnatifida, and Ferdinanda eminens.
                    Many palms, some tree ferns, and the noble Musas, especially Musa Ensete, do
                    fairly well in sheltered situations. The Cannas afford great variety of size,
                    form, and colour. The different forms of Ricinus, which are of the bolder type
                    of subjects, the more elegant Arundo Donax and its variegated variety, and the
                    very graceful Arundo conspicua may also be named. Arundinaria falcata and other
                    Bamboos, if grown in large pots or tubs and plunged in shady sheltered places
                    during summer, give a striking tropical effect; and in warm situations some of
                    these may be introduced as permanent plants. Of lesser subjects Centaurea
                    ragusina and gymnocarpa, Erythrinas, Funkias, Gunnera scabra, and some of the
                    Solanums, as S. marginatum and robustum, are all useful and effective; and many
                    others might be added.</p>

                    with close low-growing plants, in which certain figures are brought out by means
                    of plants of a different habit or having different-coloured leaves. Sometimes,
                    in addition to the carpet or ground colour, individual plants of larger size and
                    handsome appearance are dotted symmetrically over the beds, an arrangement which
                    is very telling. Some of the best plants for carpeting the surface of the beds
                    are—Antennaria tomentosa, white; Sedum corsicum and glaucum, grey; and Sedum
                    Lydium, Mentha Pulegium gibraltaricum, and Hemiaria glabra, green. The
                    Alternantheras, Amaranthuses, Iresines, and Coleuses furnish high and warm
                    colours; while Pyrethrum Parthenium aureum yields greenish yellow;
                    Mesembryanthemum cordifolium variegatum, creamy yellow; Centaureas and others,
                    white; and the succulent Echeverias and Sempervivums, glaucous rosettes, which
                    last add much to the general effect.</p>
                <p>80. <hi rend="smallcaps">Greenhouse Plants.</hi> —These are plants requiring the
                    shelter of a glass house, provided with a moderate degree of heat, of which 35°
                    Fahr, may be taken as the minimum. The house should be opened for ventilation in
                    all mild weather in winter, and daily throughout the rest of the year.</p>
                <p>The following is a select list of miscellaneous decorative plants in addition to
                    special subjects which will be noticed separately :—</p>
                <p>Abutilon Boule de Neige has pure white drooping bell-shaped flowers.</p>
                <p>Acacias are remarkably profuse-flowering plants with yellow flowers. A. armata
                    and A. Drummondii are flowering bushes; A. lophantha has ample fern-like leaves;
                    A. Riceana has pale yellow flowers in early spring, and is well suited for
                    training up rafters or pillars.</p>

                    June.</p>
                <p>Agapanthus is very ornamental and easily grown, A. umbellatus having a large
                    umbel of pale blue flowers, and A. umbellatus albiflorus white flowers.</p>
                <p>Aphelexis embraces various species of close-growing plants, half procumbent in
                    habit, producing handsome purplish-crimson and rosy-pink everlasting flowers
                    freely on the points of the shoots in May and June.</p>
                <p>Aralias have large palmate leaves.</p>
                <p>Araucaria excelsa has regularly spreading branches resembling gigantic ostrich
                    feathers.</p>
                <p>Begonias. The new tuberous-rooted hybrids are very showy, and continue to flower
                    all through the summer and autumn.</p>
                <p>Boronias are a fine group of hard-wooded shrubs, having chiefly pink flowers,
                    which bloom profusely from the mature wood; the best examples of the family are
                    B. pinnata, Drummondii, and serrulata.</p>
                <p>Chorozemas are quick-growing slender-habited plants, with highly-coloured red
                    and;yellow pea-shaped flowers, produced in racemes from the axils of the leaves;
                    'C. varium, cordatum, and spectabile are fine and distinct.</p>
                <p>Cordylines are stately plants, of which the principal are C. indivisa, with a
                    noble crown of glaucous leaves marked by orange ribs, and C. australis with
                    narrower leaves.</p>
                <p>Cytisus racemosus is one of the best subjects for early spring blooming, of dense
                    bushy habit, and bearing yellow flowers; C. Everestianus has flowers of a deep
                    orange.</p>
                <p>Daplme indica is unsurpassed for its perfume.</p>

                <p>The Dasylirions have stout woody stems and large heads of narrow leaves. Epacris
                    is a winter-flowering genus, easily grown and free-blooming, the principal sorts
                    being E. hyacinthiflora candidissima, hyacinthiflora carminata, miniata, and the
                    pure white onosmaeflora flore-pleno nivalis.</p>
                <p>Grevilleas are shrubs of slender habit, some having handsome flowers, while G.
                    robusta and others almost rival the ferns in the elegance of their leaves.</p>
                <p>Hydrangea Hortensia produces immense heads of bloom of a delicate pink, which
                    continue long in flower, and may be changed to blue by the admixture of iron
                    filings with the soil.</p>
                <p>Imantophyllum miniatum is a grand plant, the umbels of pale flame-red flowers
                    being produced at various seasons.</p>
                <p>Kalosanthes consists of splendid flowering plants, which, however, rarely bloom
                    well two years in succession.</p>
                <p>Lachenalia pendula, luteola, and tricolor are exceedingly pretty dwarf bulbs,
                    useful about April and May.</p>
                <p>Lapageria rosea is one of the very finest greenhouse climbers in existence, and
                    bears waxy bell-shaped red flowers, mottled with white; L. rosea alba is still
                    more beautiful, a clear waxy white.</p>
                <p>Lilium auratum, speciosum, and Krameri are fine, L. auratum being one of the
                    noblest flowering plants in existence.</p>
                <p>Mandevilla suaveolens, a strong-growing climber, bears beautiful, fragrant,
                    trumpet-shaped white blossoms in August and September.</p>
                <p>The Neriums are tall strong-growing subjects, with flowers of great beauty,
                    produced in cymes from the points of the mature shoots.</p>
                <p>The Passifloras produce their showy singularly-formed flowers most profusely, and
                    are very suitable for decorating the roof of a conservatory.</p>
                <p>Pimeleas are free-growing, compact-habited plants, producing flower-heads from
                    the points of the shoots; P. spectabilis rosea has flower-heads, white flushed
                    with rose, almost as large as those of a guelder-rose; P. Hendersoni has deep
                    pink, P. hispida white, and P. elegans straw-coloured flowers.</p>
                <p>Pleroma elegans is a free-flowering melastomaceous shrub, producing in succession
                    its lovely saucer-shaped flowers of the most intense purple hue, from June to
                    September.?</p>
                <p>Plumbago capensis is another abundant bloomer, and one of the very best of
                    greenhouse climbers, with large bunches of delicate grey-blue flowers.</p>
                <p>The Rhododendron furnishes a large contingent, of which the most suitable are
                    Countess of Haddington, Dalhousiae, Edgworthii, Gibsoni, Thompson!, javanicum,
                    with jasminiflorum and its beautiful varieties, Princess Royal, Princess
                    Alexandra, Princess of Wales, and Duchess of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Statices include some very highly ornamental plants, especially S.
                    bras-sicaefolia, profusa, and imbricata.</p>
                <p>Tacsouias are magnificent climbers; indeed, T. Van Volxemii is one of the very
                    finest of the climbing plants which flower in autumn.</p>
                <p>Trachelospermum jasminoides, better known as Rhynchospermum, very fragrant, and
                    moderately vigorous, is suitable for a pillar, and produces white flowers in May
                    and June.</p>
                <p>Tropseolums are charming pot climbers, of which may be mentioned T. azure urn,
                    brachyceras, speciosum, tricolorum, and Jarrattii.</p>
                <p>Vallota is a very choice evergreen bulb, V. purpurea producing highly-coloured
                    scarlet flowers, in umbels, in August and September.</p>
                <p>81. <hi rend="italic">Agave.—</hi> Bold-habited, succulent plants, some of the
                    larger of which are well adapted for conservatory decoration and prominent
                    situations on terraces, &amp;c. The American Aloe, Agave americana, with its
                    varieties variegata and mediopicta, all require to be kept moderately dry and
                    safe from frost during the winter, and grow well in strong loam, sand, and
                    rotten manure. Among others of the larger varieties are A. potatorum and
                    miradorensis, and of the smaller ones, A. filifera, applanata, Verschaifeltii,
                    and schidigera. Still smaller dense-growing sorts are A. Richardii, horrida,
                    Victoriae Reginae, and Bessereriana.</p>
                <p>82. <hi rend="italic">Aloe.—</hi> Succulent plants,extremely variable in
                    character. They all thrive best in a sandy loam, well drained, and not over
                    watered. The old Partridge-breast Aloe, A. variegata, is well adapted for a
                    window; A. ferox, supralaevis, and arborescens are tall plants; A. saponaria,
                    mitraeformis, albocincta, and lineata are smaller; A. serra, variegata, humilis,
                    and serrulata are dwarf. The Fan Aloe, A. plicatilis, produces its flowers in
                    winter. A group of dwarf showy-flowered aloes, often separated under the name of
                    Gasteria, flower in early spring. The following are of a spiral habit of growth—
                    G. spiralis, obliqua, undata, and carinata; while, of those of distichous
                    growth, G. nigricans, lingua, verrucosa, and intermedia may be recommended.
                    Besides these there are the Apicras and the Haworthias, all formerly known as
                    aloes, which are very dwarf.</p>
                <p>83. <hi rend="italic">Azalea.—</hi> The beautiful varieties now in cultivation
                    have been bred from a few originals, natives of the hilly regions of India and
                    China. They are perhaps unequalled asindoor decorative plants. The Chinese
                    species, A. vittata, will commence to open its blooms in September, and other
                    sorts keep up a succession for several months, for some of the varieties may be
                    forced into bloom during the winter, and others flower through the spring up to
                    May and June. They are usually increased by grafting the half-ripened shoots on
                    the stronger-growing kinds, the shoots of the stock and the grafts being in a
                    similarly half-ripened condition, and the plants being placed in a moist heat of
                    65°. Large plants of inferior kinds, if healthy, may be grafted all over with
                    the choicer sorts, so as to obtain a large specimen in a short time. They
                    require a rich and fibrous peat soil, with a mixture of sand to prevent it
                    getting waterlogged. The best time to pot azaleas is three or four weeks after
                    the blooming is over. The soil should be made quite solid to prevent its
                    retaining too much water. To produce handsome plants, they must while young be
                    stopped as required. Specimens that have got leggy may be cut back just before
                    growth commences. The lowest temperature for them during the winter is about
                    35°, and during their season of growth from 55° to 65° at night, and 75° by day,
                    the atmosphere being at the same time well charged, with moisture. They are
                    liable to the attacks of thrips and red spider, which do great mischief if not
                    promptly destroyed.</p>
                <p>84. <hi rend="italic">Calceolaria.—</hi> Originally introduced under various
                    specific forms from Chili and Peru, the calceolaria of the present day has been
                    developed into a highly decorative plant, in which the herbaceous habit has
                    preponderated. The plants are now very generally raised annually from seed,
                    which is sown about the end of July in a mixture of loam, leaf-mould, and sand,
                    and, being very small, must only be slightly covered. When the plants are large
                    enough to handle they are pricked out an inch or two apart into 3-inch or 5-inch
                    pots; when a little more advanced they are potted singly. They should be
                    wintered in a greenhouse with a night temperature of about 40°, occupying a
                    shelf near the light. By the end of February they should be moved into 8-inch or
                    10-inch pots, using a compost of three parts good turfy loam, one part
                    leafmould, and one part thoroughly rotten manure, with a fair addition of sand.
                    They need plenty of light and air, but must not be subjected to draughts. When
                    the pots get well filled with roots, they must be liberally supplied with manure
                    water. In the early stages of growth the plants are subject to the attacks of
                    the green fly, for which they must be fumigated. Named varieties are not now
                    grown, as a good strain of seed will yield satisfactory flowers.</p>
                <p>The shrubby calceolarias used for bedding are increased from cuttings, planted in
                    autumn in cold frames, where they can be wintered, by the use of mats and a good
                    layer of litter placed over the glass and round the sides as a protection from
                    frost.</p>
                <p>85. <hi rend="italic">Camellia.—</hi> This favourite plant, a native of Japan, is
                    deserv- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> edly popular, on account of its glossy
                    foliage andmagnificent flowers. It is usually propagated by cuttings, to furnish
                    stocks on which the choicer kinds are grafted. It will succeed either in peat or
                    loam or a mixture of both, but in any case an addition of turfy fibre and of
                    sand is also necessary. The plants should have abundance of water, especially in
                    the growing season, and should be potted as they complete their growth and are
                    about to set their flowers; they do not, however, require repotting so often as
                    most plants. Fire heat need only be employed when the object is to obtain
                    flowers in the autumn and winter months. To produce them at this season it
                    becomes necessary to start the plants into growth correspondingly early. When
                    grown in cold houses, they do not generally flower until about February or
                    March, at which stage the plants enjoy a temperature of 45° or 50°. When fire
                    heat is applied to assist the opening of the flowers, it should not much exceed
                    55°, and whilst the plants are subjected to this heat the atmosphere must on no
                    account be allowed to become dry, or the buds will probably drop. When making
                    their growth they need an abundant supply of water at the roots, as well as
                    copious syringings twice a day, but as terminal buds become visible they should
                    be kept drier. Liquid manure is of great assistance to plants that have flowered
                    very heavily, while they are making their growth, and the addition of a little
                    soot imparts a dark-green colour to the leaves. If grown in an open-roofed light
                    house, shade will be required during very bright weather whilst the young shoots
                    are being developed, but if grown in a lean-to house facing the north, shade
                    will not be required. It is sometimes necessary to move the plants out of the
                    house after they have set their flowers, to keep them from coming on too
                    rapidly. In this case they should have placed over them a light framework and
                    movable screen.</p>
                <p>The scale is the most troublesome insect which attacks the camellia. To remove
                    the white scale, the plants should be washed with a sponge and solution of soft
                    soap as soon as their growth is completed, and again before the buds begin to
                    swell. The brown scale may be got rid of by repeated washings with one of the
                    many insecticides, such as Fowler’s, but it should be applied at a temperature
                    of 90°. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Camellia,</hi> vol. iv. ρ. 737.</p>
                <p>Some of the best varieties are—Alba plena (old double white), Bealii, Bonomiana,
                    candidissima, Chandler's Elegans, Contessa Lavinia Maggi, Countess of Ellesmere,
                    Donckelaari, eximia, fimbriata, Henri Favre, imbricata, imbricata alba, Jubilee,
                    Madame Ambroise Verschafielt, Mathotiana, Mathotiana alba, Princess Mary,
                    reticulata flore-pleno, Saccoi nova, and Valtavaredo.</p>
                <p>86. <hi rend="italic">Cinerarias</hi> can be raised freely from seeds, and though
                    there are named varieties in existence, a good strain of seed will yield flowers
                    almost as fine. They must be kept, especially while young, free from aphides, to
                    which they are more than ordinarily subject. For spring flowering the seeds may
                    be sown in April or May in well-drained pots or pans, in soil of three parts
                    loam to two parts leafmould, with one-sixth sand; cover the seed thinly with
                    fine soil, and press the surface firm. When the seedlings are large enough to
                    handle, prick them out in pans or pots of similar soil, and when more advanced
                    pot them singly in 4-inch pots, using soil a trifle less sandy. They should be
                    grown in shallow frames facing the north, and, if so situated that the sun
                    shines upon the plants in the middle of the day, they must be slightly shaded;
                    give plenty of air, and never allow them to get dry. When well established with
                    roots, shift them into 6-inch pots, which should be liberally supplied with
                    manure water as they get filled with roots. In winter they should be removed to
                    a pit or house, where a little heat can be supplied whenever there is a risk of
                    their getting frozen. They should stand on a moist bottom, but must not be
                    subjected to cold draughts. When the flowering stems appear, give manure water
                    at every alternate watering. Seeds sown in March, and grown on in this way, <pb

                    temperature of from 40° to 45° at night, with a little more warmth in the day;
                    and those sown in April and May will succeed them during the early spring
                    months, the latter set of plants being subjected to a temperature of 38° or 40°

                <p>87. <hi rend="italic">Correa.—</hi> This genus of Australian plants is extremely
                    useful for winter flowering. The best of them is C. cardinalis, which affords a
                    succession of tube-shaped crimson flowers during the whole of the winter. They
                    are increased by cuttings, and grown in rough peaty soil, with a slight addition
                    of loam and sand. After the plants have done flowering, they should all get a
                    little artificial warmth, plenty of moisture, and a slight shade, while they are
                    making their growth, during which period the tips of the young shoots should be
                    nipped out when 6 or 8 inches long. When the growth is complete, a half-shady
                    place outdoors during August and September will be suitable, with protection
                    from parching winds and hot sunshine.</p>
                <p>88. <hi rend="italic">Cyclamen. —</hi> Of late years this flower has been so much
                    improved that no plant of moderate size can be made to contribute more floral
                    display in winter. It is raised from seeds in various shades of colour, from the
                    purest white to a deep purple. The seeds should be sown in October or November,
                    in well-drained seedpans,· in an equal mixture of fine loam and leaf-mould with
                    an addition of sand, the seeds slightly covered, and the pans placed near the
                    light in a temperature of 50°. When the seedlings appear, they must be pricked
                    out into 5-inch pots, six or eight in each, and wintered in a similar
                    temperature and situation. In spring they must be potted singly in 3-inch pots,
                    and thinly shaded during bright weather. When they have filled their pots with
                    roots they should be repotted, using similar soil, into 4-inch pots, in which
                    they are to flower. In potting, the corms or tuberous roots should not be more
                    than half covered with the soil. A low house or pit is the best place in which
                    to grow them, shading them if requisite, giving plenty of air, watering
                    regularly, and syringing overhead in the afternoon to keep down thrips and red
                    spider. The temperature should range from 45° to 50°, with plenty of air. They
                    should flower in February and March. After blooming they should be placed in a
                    pit where they can be shaded as required, and as they show signs of going to
                    rest they should receive less water, but should not be allowed to get quite dry.
                    In autumn they may be shifted into pots a size larger, and they will come into
                    flower earlier than in the first year. It is not advisable to keep them after
                    the third season. Some growers recommend after flowering to turn the plants out
                    of their pots into a bed of prepared peat or leaf-soil in some half-shady spot,
                    where they can be sprinkled overhead every afternoon during dry sunny weather,
                    so as to encourage plenty of healthy foliage. In this case they should be lifted
                    early in the autumn.</p>
                <p>89. <hi rend="italic">Erica.—</hi> The species of heaths cultivated in English
                    greenhouses are mostly South African, or have sprung from South African
                    originals. They are of dense twiggy growth, with needle-shaped leaves, and
                    beautiful wax-like flowers, which in some or other of the kinds are produced
                    almost throughout the year. During the winter and early months E. eaffra,
                    gracilis, vernalis, hiemalis, melanthera, persoluta, rubens, Willmorei,
                    Sindryana, and others produce their blossoms; later on bloom E. florida,
                    affinis, Cavendishiana, exquisita, ventricosa and its many varieties, and the
                    charming aristata; next come E. Savileana, Irbyana, Austiniana, Jacksoni,
                    retorta major, and others, which last on till September, a few continuing till
                    the end of the year. Heaths are propagated under bell-glasses by cuttings, which
                    should be taken as soon in the spring as the wood is sufficiently firm, and
                    planted in silver sand, the lower leaves having been removed; they should be
                    kept in a temperature of 60“, and the glasses must be wiped occasionally to
                    prevent the plants from damping off. When rooted they should be gradually inured
                    to the air by the occasional removal of the glasses. In the spring following
                    they should be potted singly into thumb pots, and kept close and moist until
                    they take to the new soil. Heaths require peat soil, which for hard-wooded
                    slow-growing kinds should be of a close hard texture, while for soft-rvooded
                    slow-growing sorts a mixture of two-thirds of hard peat with one of a softer
                    nature, and for the soft-wooded quickgrowing varieties equal quantities of hard
                    and soft peat should be used, with silver sand according to the composition of
                    the peat. The pots must always be well drained, and the plants must never be
                    allowed to become pot-bound. The best season for potting is in March and April,
                    or in September when the summer heats are over. The new soil must be made as
                    firm as the old ball, so as to retain the water. A low span-roofed house,
                    admitting abundance of light, is most suitable for these plants; and they
                    require air in abundance, especially during the season of active growth. They
                    have so great a dislike to fire heat that any degree of cold short of actual
                    frost is preferable to it. When they have grown into specimen plants they should
                    be set out of doors, from the latter part of July till the beginning of
                    September, in order to enable them to resist the attacks of mildew. Water should
                    never be given before the soil has got sufficiently dry to need it, nor should
                    the plants be syringed overhead summer or winter. Especially is this the case
                    with the hard-wooded kinds. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Heath,</hi> vol. xι. p.
                    589.</p>
                <p>Some of the best of the earlier flowering heaths are—E. affinis, aristata,
                    Bergiana, Candolleana, Cavendishiana, Devoniana, florida, hiemalis, Lindleyana,
                    Massonι major, mutabilis, propendens, Sindryana, tortiliflora, ventricosa and
                    its varieties, Victoria, and Willmorei. The later ones are well represented by
                    E. Austiniana, ampullacea and its varieties, Aitoniana Turn-bullii, ferruginea
                    superba, gemmifera elegans, Hartnelli, Irbyana, jasminiflora alba, Marnockiana,

                <p>90. <hi rend="italic">Fuchsia.—</hi> This well-known decorative soft-wooded plant
                    comes from the temperate parts of South America, but has been improved by
                    selection and hybridization. Fuchsias strike readily from cuttings, the most
                    usual method being to place old plants in warmth about February, and as soon as
                    they have pushed shoots a couple of inches or so in length, to take them off and
                    put them in small pots, in a temperature of 60°; they will root in two or three
                    weeks, when they should be moved singly into 3-inch pots; and they must be again
                    shifted into 8-inch or 9-inch pots as soon as those they already occupy are
                    moderately filled with roots. The leading shoot, as well as the side branches,
                    should be topped two or three times during the spring, and a single stick placed
                    to the main stem so as to keep it upright. They should be syringed in the
                    afternoons, to promote growth and to keep down aphides and red spider. By the
                    end of June or July such plants will be disposed to flower. A good compost for
                    fuchsias consists of four parts good fibrous loam to two parts well-rotted
                    manure and leaf-mould, with a fair sprinkling of sand. When larger plants are
                    required the cuttings should be struck about the end of July or beginning of
                    August, and kept gently growing through the autumn and winter in 6-inch pots on
                    a shelf near the glass, with a night temperature of 50°. At the end of February
                    they should be shifted into 10-inch or 12-inch pots, and by the end of April
                    they will be in a condition to move to 16-inch or 18-inch pots, and the
                    temperature should be raised to 55°. The shape of the plants should be regulated
                    by timely pinching of the shoots, the pyramidal and standard forms being the
                    most elegant. The old plants may be kept during winter in any dryish place free
                    from frost; prune them back in spring, and repot in fresh soil. The varieties
                    are constantly changing through the introduction of novelties. See <hi

                <p>91. <hi rend="italic">Heliotropium.—</hi> The Peruvian Heliotrope, Heliotropium
                    peruvianum, is a great favourite with cultivators, on account of the delicious
                    fragance of its blossoms, which has obtained for it the popular name of “cherry
                    pie.” The plants are easily increased by cuttings, which are struck in July and
                    August, or from young shoots obtained in heat in early spring; when rooted they
                    should be potted singly into small pots, using as a compost fibry loam, sandy
                    peat, and well-decomposed stable manure from an old hotbed. The plants soon
                    require to be shifted into a pot a size larger. To secure early-flowering
                    plants, cuttings should be struck in August, potted off before winter sets in,
                    and kept in a warm greenhouse. In the spring larger pots should be given, and
                    the plants shortened back to make them bushy. They require frequent shiftings
                    during the summer, to induce them to bloom freely. There are many varieties,
                    differing in habit and in the colour of their flowers.</p>
                <p>The heliotrope makes an elegant standard. The plants must in this case be allowed
                    to send up a central shoot, and all the side growths must be pinched off until
                    the necessary height is reached, when the shoot must be stopped and lateral
                    growths will be produced to form the head. During winter they should be kept
                    somewhat dry, and· in spring the ball should be reduced and the plants repotted,
                    the shoots being slightly pruned, so as to maintain a symmetrical head. When
                    they are planted out against the Avails and pillars of the greenhouse or
                    conservatory an abundance of highly-perfumed blossoms will be supplied all the
                    year round. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Helio-tkope,</hi> vol. xi. p. 633.</p>
                <p>92. <hi rend="italic">Mescmbryanthemum. —</hi> These are interesting Cape plants,
                    some of theιu of a very showy character, and others remarkable as curiosities.
                    They belong to the class of succulents, and with the exception of the curious
                    sorts, all grow and strike freely in a mixture of loam and leaf-mould with a
                    dash of sand. The flowering kinds should be kept only two or three years.
                    Cuttings should be put in about May, and well exposed. They will stand a few
                    degrees of frost, but should be kept from growing in winter.</p>
                <p>The best flowering sorts, most of which are adapted for window-boxes, are—Μ.
                    barbatum, blandum, candens, conspicuum, curviflorum, falcatum, formosum,
                    glaucum, polyanthum, reflexum, retroflexum, roseum, and spectabile. These can be
                    used for sunny summer beds very well, as those that require it can be pegged
                    down. Of the curious varieties, some of the choicest are Μ. agninum, albinum,
                    caninum, felinum, murinum, tigrinum, vulpinum, dolabriforme, densum, fissum,
                    linguaeforme, minimum, obconel-lum, and octophyllum. These are all dwarf
                    growers, and require more sand and some brick rubbish in the soil; they should
                    also have less water.</p>
                <p>93. <hi rend="italic">Pelargonium.—</hi> The various races of pelargoniums have
                    sprang from the intermixture of some of the species obtained from the Cape. The
                    older show-flowered varieties have been gradually acquired through a long series
                    of years. The fancy varieties, as well as the French spotted varieties and the
                    market type, have been evolved from them. The zonal race, on the other hand, has
                    been perfected within the last quarter of a century. In all the sections the
                    varieties are of a highly ornamental character, but for general culti∙</p>

                <p>vation the market type is preferable for indoor purposes, while the zonals are
                    effective either in the greenhouse or flower garden. Some of the Cape species
                    are still in cultivation,—the leaves of many of them being beautifully
                    subdivided, almost fern-like in character, and some of them deliciously scented.
                    A few of these are well adapted for bedding out.</p>
                <p>Some of the most striking of this set are—P. Blandfordianum, echinatum,
                    graveolens, melananthum, and Schottii; while the following have finely-scented
                    leaves :—P. capitatum, citriodorum, crispum, and odoratissimum. To these may be
                    added, from amongst the earlier hybrids, those named Lady Plymouth, Fair Helen,
                    ignescens, Moore’s Victory, Pretty Polly, quercifolium and its varieties,
                    Shrubland Pet, and the various sports from Unique.</p>
                <p>The best soil for pelargoniums is a mellow fibrous loam with good stable manure
                    in about the proportion of one-fifth; when used it should not be sifted, but
                    pulled to pieces by the hand, and as much sand should be added as will allow the
                    water to pass freely through it. The large-flowered and fancy kinds cannot beaι∙
                    so much water as most soft-wooded plants, and the latter should have a rather
                    lighter soil.</p>
                <p>All the pelargoniums are readily increased by cuttings made from the shoots when
                    the plants are headed down after flowering, or in the spring, when they will
                    root freely in a temperature of 50°. They must not be kept too close, and must
                    be very moderately watered. When rooted they may be moved into well-drained
                    3-inch pots, and should have the points pinched out in order to induce them to
                    push out several shoots near the base. These shoots are, when long enough, to be
                    trained in a horizontal direction; and when they have made three joints they
                    should have the points again pinched out. These early-struck plants will be
                    ready for shifting into 6-inch pots by the autumn, and should still be trained
                    outwards. The show varieties after flowering should be set out of doors in a
                    sunny spot to ripen their wood, and should only get water enough to keep them
                    from flagging. In the course of two or three weeks they will be ready to cut
                    back within two joints of where these were last stopped, when they should be
                    placed in a frame or pit, and kept close and dry until they have broken. When
                    they have pushed an inch or so, turn them out of their pots, shake off the old
                    soil, trim the straggling roots, and repot them firmly in smaller pots if
                    practicable; keep them near the light, and as the shoots grow continue to train
                    them outwardly. They require to be kept in a light house, and to be set well up
                    to the glass; the night temperature should range about 45°; and air should be
                    given on all mild days, but no cold currents allowed, nor more water than is
                    necessary to keep the soil from getting parched. The young shoots should be
                    topped about the end of October, and when they have grown an inch or two beyond
                    this, they may be shifted into 7-inch pots for flowering. The shoots must be
                    kept tied out so as to be fully exposed to the light. If required to flower
                    early they should not be stopped again; if not until June they may be stopped in
                    February.</p>
                <p>The zonal varieties, which are almost continuous bloomers, are of much value as
                    decorative subjects; they seldom require much pruning after the first stopping.
                    For winter flowering, young plants should be grown on during the summer, and not
                    allowed to flower. When blossoms are required, they should be placed close up to
                    the glass in a light house with a temperature of 60°, only just as much water
                    being given as will keep them growing. For bedding purposes the zonal varieties
                    are best struck towards the middle of August in the open air, taken up and
                    potted or planted in boxes as soon as struck, and preserved in frames or in the
                    greenhouse during winter.</p>
                <p>The fancy varieties root best early in spring from the half-ripened shoots; but
                    they are slow growers, rather delicate in constitution, and very impatient of
                    excess of water at the root.</p>
                <p>94. <hi rend="italic">Petunia. —</hi> The varieties of petunia, especially the
                    double forms, make admirable specimens for pot culture. These and the other
                    named varieties are propagated by cuttings taken from stock plants kept through
                    the winter on a dry warm shelf, and moved into a brisk moist heat in early
                    spring; the young shoots are planted in pans or pots filled with sandy soil,
                    and, aided by a brisk bottom heat, strike root in a few days. They are then
                    potted singly into thumbpots, and when once established are gradually hardened
                    off, and afterwards repotted as required. The shoots should be topped to make
                    bushy plants, and their tops may be utilized as cuttings. The single varieties
                    are raised from seeds sown in light sandy soil in heat, in the early spring, and
                    very slightly covered. The plants need to be pricked out or potted off as soon
                    as large enough to handle. Good strains of seeds supply plants suitable for
                    bedding; but, as they do not reproduce themselves exactly, any sorts
                    particularly required must be propagated, like the double ones, from
                    cuttings.</p>
                <p>95. <hi rend="italic">Primula.—</hi> One of the most popular of winter and early
                    spring decorative plants is the Chinese Primrose, Primula sinensis, of which
                    some superb strains have during the last few years been obtained. For ordinary
                    purposes young plants are raised annually from seeds, sown about the beginning
                    of March, and again for succession in April, and if needed in May. The seed
                    should be sown in well-drained pans, in a compost of three parts light loam, one
                    part well-rotted leaf-mould, and one part clean gritty sand, as it does not
                    germinate freely if the soil contains stagnant moisture. The surface should be
                    pressed smooth and gently watered before sowing, and the seeds should be only
                    just covered with some very fine compost, half soil half sand, and over that a
                    thin layer of chopped sphagnum to keep it damp, and obviate the necessity of
                    watering. When the seeds germinate, remove the moss, and place them in a
                    well-lighted position near the glass, shading them from the sun with thin white
                    paper, and giving water moderately as required. When they are large enough to
                    handle, prick them out in pans or shallow boxes, and, as soon as they have made
                    leaves an inch long, pot them singly in 3-inch pots, using in the soil a little
                    rotten dung. They should then be placed in a light frame near the glass in an
                    open situation, facing the north. When their pots are filled with roots they
                    should be moved into 6-inch or 7-inch pots. The soil should now consist of three
                    parts good loam broken with the hand, one part rotten dung and leaf-mould, and
                    as much sand as will keep the whole open. They should be potted firmly, and kept
                    in frames close up to the glass till September, excess in watering being
                    carefully avoided. In the autumn they should be transferred to a light house and
                    placed near the glass, the atmosphere being kept dry by the occasional use of
                    fire heat. The night temperature should be kept about 45°. When the flowering
                    stems are growing up, manure water once or twice a week will be beneficial. The
                    semi-double varieties are increased from seeds, but the fully double ones and
                    any particular sort can only be increased by cuttings made by dividing the
                    crowns with a portion of stem attached, the plants being first well dried,
                    almost to shrivelling; the cuttings should be placed in small pots in sandy
                    soil, put in a moderate dryish heat, and only just watered enough to prevent
                    flagging. When they are well rooted, they may be potted like the others. In
                    winter they require an intermediate temperature of 45° or 50° at night, and a
                    little higher in the day, with air when the weather is suitable.</p>
                <p>96. <hi rend="italic">Richardia. —</hi> This plant, B. aethiopica, called also
                    Calla aethiopica and the Nile Lily, is a fine subject for greenhouse decoration
                    during the spring months. It is a stately tuberous-rooted perennial, with broad
                    arrow-shaped leaves, and large white flower-spathes, that last long in beauty.
                    The plants should be carefully divided about March, and planted out during May
                    in well-enriched shallow trenches. Being semi-aquatics, they cannot be kept too
                    moist all through the summer months. Plants kept in pots are generally neglected
                    in this way, and hence are rarely seen in really first-class condition. The
                    richardias are hardy if their crowns are kept under water; but a very little
                    frost disfigures the foliage, and therefore they should be placed in the pits or
                    the greenhouse towards the end of October. They may be had in flower during the
                    winter, but in that case they must have a little warmth to give them a
                    start.</p>
                <p>97. <hi rend="italic">Salvia.—</hi> Some of the Salvias or Sages are among the
                    best and most showy among soft-wooded winter-flowering plants, the blossoms
                    being of a bright-glowing scarlet. The three most useful species are S.
                    splendens, S. Heeri, and S. gesneraeflora, the first commencing to flower early
                    in the autumn and lasting till Christmas, while the others follow immediately in
                    succession, and continue in full beauty till April. Young plants should be
                    propagated annually about February, and after nursing through the spring should
                    be grown outdoors in a fully exposed situation, where they can be plungedin some
                    non-conducting material, such as half-decomposed leaves. The young shoots should
                    be stopped to secure bushy plants, but not later than the middle of August. The
                    most suitable compost for them is a mixture of mellow fibry loam enriched with a
                    little mild thoroughly decomposed manure, made sufficiently porous by the
                    addition of sand or grit. In spring, and during the blooming period, the
                    temperature should be intermediate between that of a stove and greenhouse. There
                    are other very ornamental species of easy growth, increased by cuttings in
                    spring, and succeeding well in ordinary rich loamy soil. Of these S.
                    angustifolia bears spikes of fine bright-blue flowers in May or June; S.
                    chamaedryoides, a dwarfish subject, has deep-blue flowers in August; S. fulgens
                    produces scarlet flowers in August; and S. involucrata produces fine red flowers
                    during the autumn. S. patens is a lovely blue free-blooming sort, flowering in
                    August, the colour being unique.</p>
                <p>98. <hi rend="smallcaps">Stove Plants.</hi> —For the successful culture of stove
                    plants two houses at least, wherein different temperatures can be maintained,
                    should be devoted to their growth. The temperature during winter should range at
                    night from about 55° in the cooler to 65° in the warmer house, and from 65° to
                    75° by day, allowing a few degrees further rise by sun heat. In summer the
                    temperature may range 10° higher by artificial heat, night and day, and will
                    often by sun heat run up to 90° or even 95°, beyond which it should be kept down
                    by ventilation. During the growing period the atmosphere must be kept moist by
                    damping the walls and pathways, and by syringing the plants, according to their
                    needs; when growth is completed less moisture will be necessary. Watering,
                    which, except during the resting period, should generally be copious, is best
                    done in the forenoon; while syringing should be done early in the afternoon to
                    admit of the foliage drying moderately before night. When the pots become filled
                    with roots, waterings of weak liquid manure <pb break="no"

                <p>99. <hi rend="italic">Achimcnes</hi> have scaly tubers, which are kept dry and in
                    a state of rest in a temperature of 55° during the winter months, and started
                    into growth about March, a second batch being started in April. They should be
                    placed 6 inches asunder in pans filled to within 1⅜ inches of the rim with
                    leaf-mould or cocoa-refuse, made rather sandy, and slightly covered with the
                    soil. The pans should be set in a warm pit or frame, and the soil kept slightly
                    moistened, and when the young shoots are a couple of inches long they may be
                    placed six or eight in a 6-inch pot, in a soil of three parts fibrous loam and
                    two parts leaf-mould, mixed with a little sand. The temperature should be from
                    65° to 70°, and they should be well exposed to light. When 6 inches long, pinch
                    out the points to induce them to branch, and give more water, syringing overhead
                    to keep red spider in check. As soon as the flower buds appear, give weak manure
                    water two or three times a week. They should all through their growth have
                    sufficient air to keep them from getting drawn, and when the flowers begin to
                    open should be gradually inured to bear the temperature of the conservatory.
                    When they show signs of going to rest, less water may be given; and after the
                    tops have died down, the tubers may be stored in dry sand in a temperature of
                    about 55°. Achimenes have also a fine effect grown in wire baskets from the roof
                    of the plant house.</p>
                <p>The following arc good'kinds:—Ambroise Verschaffelt, belmontensis, Firefly,
                    longiflora alba, longiflora major, Mauve Queen, Parsonsii, Rose Queen, Stella,
                    and Williamsii.</p>

                    consists of splendid bulbous plants, of easy culture and free-blooming habit.
                    Like other bulbs they are increased by offsets, which should be carefully
                    removed when the plants are at rest, and should be allowed to attain a fair size
                    before removal. These young bulbs should be potted singly in February or March,
                    in mellow loamy soil with a moderate quantity of sand, about two-thirds of the
                    bulb being kept above the level of the soil, which should be made quite solid.
                    They should be removed to a temperature of 60° by night and 70° by day, very
                    carefully watered until the roots have begun to grow freely, after which the
                    soil should be kept moderately moist. As they advance the temperature should be
                    raised to 70° at night, and to 80° or higher with sun heat by day. They do not
                    need shading, but should have plenty of air, and be syringed daily in the
                    afternoon. When growing they require a good supply of water. After the decay of
                    the flowers they should be returned to a brisk moist temperature of from 70° to
                    80° by day during summer to perfect their leaves, and. then be ripened off in
                    autumn. Through the winter they should have less water, but must not be kept
                    entirely dry. The minimum temperature should now be about 55°, to be increased
                    10° or 15° in spring. As the bulbs get large they will occasionally need
                    shifting into larger pots.</p>
                <p>A few of the best sorts are—Ackermanni pulcherrima, aulica, conspicua, Duchess
                    of. Connaught, Hercules, Leopoldii, Meteor, Mrs Baker, Mrs Morgan, Oriflamme,
                    pardina, pyrrochroa, Queen Victoria, striata superba, Thalia, Unique, Virgil,
                    and vittata. New varieties are being constantly raised.</p>
                <p>101. <hi rend="italic">Begonias</hi> are represented by numerous species,
                    herbaceous: and subshrubby. There are several free-flowering hybrids, such as B.
                    weltoniensis, Saundersii, fuchsioides, prestoniensis, ascotiensis, &amp;c.;
                    there is the group of ornamental-leaved kinds represented by B. Rex; and there
                    is the tuberous-rooted free-blooming brilliant race, developed recently, mainly
                    from B. boliviensis and B. Veitchii.</p>
                <p>Cuttings from flowering begonias root freely in sandy soil, placed in heat at any
                    season when moderately firm, and as soon as rooted should be potted singly into
                    3-inch pots, in sandy loam mixed with leaf-mould and sand. They should be
                    stopped to keep them bushy, placed in a light situation, and thinly shaded in
                    the middle of very bright days. In a few weeks they will require another shift.
                    They should not be overpotted, but instead assisted by manure water. The pots
                    should be placed in a light pit near the roof glass. The summer-flowering kinds
                    will soon commence blooming, but the autumn and winter-flowering sorts should be
                    kept growing on in a temperature of from 55° to 60° by night, with a few degrees
                    more in the day. The tuberous-rooted sorts require to be kept at rest in winter,
                    in a medium temperature, almost but not quite dry. In February they should be
                    potted in a compost of sandy loam and leaf-mould, and placed in a temperate pit
                    until May or June, when they may be moved to the greenhouse for flowering. If
                    they afterwards get at all pot-bound, weak manure should be applied. After
                    blooming the supply of water must be again slackened, and in winter the plants
                    should be stored in a dry place, secure from frost; they are increased by late
                    summer and autumn cuttings, after being partially cut down.</p>
                <p>102. <hi rend="italic">Bouυardia.—</hi> These plants are best increased by
                    cuttings taken off in April, and placed in a brisk heat in a propagating frame
                    with a close atmosphere. When rooted they should be potted singly into 3-inch
                    pots in fibrous peat and loam, mixed with one-fourth leaf-mould, and a good
                    sprinkling of sand, and kept in a temperature of 70°by night and 80° during the
                    day; shade when required; syringe overhead in the afternoon, and close the house
                    with sunheat. The plants should be topped to ensure a bushy habit, and as they
                    grow must be shifted into 6-inch or 7-inch pots. After midsummer they should be
                    moved to a cool pit, where they may remain till the middle of September,
                    receiving plenty of air and space. They should then be removed to a house, and a
                    portion of the plants should be put at once in a temperature of about 70° at
                    night, with a few degrees higher in the day time, to bring them into flower.
                    Others must be moved into heat to supply flowers in succession through the
                    winter and spring. Some of the best kinds are B. elegans, Hogarth, jasminiflora,
                    Maiden’s Blush, and Vreelandii.</p>
                <p>103. <hi rend="italic">Cactus.—</hi> This old-fashioned name includes many modern
                    genera of handsome or interesting succulents, the principal of which are briefly
                    mentioned below. <hi rend="italic">Cereus</hi> is well represented by C.
                    speciosissimus, a quadrangular-stemmed spiny plant, requiring stove heat, and a
                    loamy soil freely mixed with hard drainage material; it must not be overpotted.
                    <hi rend="italic">Echinocactus</hi> is a genus of dwarf fleshy spiny plants,
                    which are slow growers, and must have plenty of sun heat; they require sandy
                    loam, with a mixture of sand and bricks finely broken, and must be potted
                    firmly, and kept dry in winter. <hi rend="italic">Echinopsis</hi> is a group of
                    dwarfish plants resembling the Echinocacti, which bear flowers about a foot
                    long, varying from white to deep rose. <hi rend="italic">Epiphyllum</hi> is a
                    group of handsome plants easily increased from cuttings, but from their drooping
                    habit they are better adapted for grafting on <hi rend="italic"
                    >thePereskia,</hi> so as to form small standards. The Pereskia stocks are strμck
                    during the winter or spring from cuttings placed in heat, and should be grown in
                    sandy loam, the pots being well drained; these must be kept to a single stem,
                    and when a foot or 18 inches high, and of a firm woody texture, should be
                    grafted with small pieces of the Epiphyllum. They may be grown for a
                    considerable time in 6-inch or 7-inch pots, but must have free drainage. After
                    grafting they should be grown on in heat and in plenty of light through the
                    summer, but by the autumn should have less warmth and moisture. A winter
                    temperature of 50° will be sufficient, but in January a portion may be started
                    in a temperature of 60°, in which they will soon show flower. This treatment
                    being continued they will last for many years, and go on increasing in size.
                    There are a number of varieties of E. truncatum, differing chiefly in the amount
                    and shade of rose colour or crimson in the flowers. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammillaria</hi> consists of very interesting dwarf globular or cylindrical
                    plants, remarkable for the beautiful colour of their numerous spines, and the
                    irregular arrangement of the mammillae into which their surface is broken up.
                    They grow freely in a cool greenhouse, and require moderate watering in summer,
                    with occasional syringing overhead. The spines are in some species white, in
                    others yellow, or red, or brown, or almost black. <hi rend="italic">Opuntia</hi>
                    is the prickly pear of southern Europe, or Indian fig of South America; the
                    species are scarcely ornamental plants, but are interesting on account of their
                    variable development. The cochineal insect is reared on some of the
                    larger-growing sorts. O. vulgaris and Rafinesquiana are hardy in the south of
                    England. <hi rend="italic">Phyllocacties</hi> is one of the most ornamental
                    genera of cacti, and is of easy culture, requiring dry stove treatment. Cuttings
                    strike readily in spring before growth has commenced; they should be potted in
                    3-inch or 4-inch pots, well-drained, in loamy soil made very porous by the
                    admixture of finely-broken crocks and <pb break="no"

                    these pots are filled with roots they are to be shifted into larger ones, but
                    overpotting must be avoided. During the summer they need considerable heat, all
                    the light possible, and plenty of air. In winter a temperature of 45° or 50°
                    will be sufficient, and they must be kept tolerably dry at the root. By the
                    spring they may have larger pots if required, and should be kept in a hot and
                    fairly moistened atmosphere; and. by the end of June, when they have made new
                    growth, they may be turned out under a south wall in the full sun, water being
                    given only as required. In autumn they are to be returned to a cool house, and
                    wintered in a dry stove. The turning of them outdoors to ripen their growth is
                    the surest way to obtain flowers, but they do not take on a free blooming habit
                    until they have attained some age. Amongst the best sorts are P. Ackermanni,
                    Jenkinsoni, crenatus, and speciosus.</p>
                <p>104. <hi rend="italic">Caladium.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These beautiful
                    arads are increased by division of the young growths made in the spring. They
                    should be potted in small pots infibroussandypeat, well drained,andkept in a
                    temperature of 65° by night; afterwards they should be changed into larger ones,
                    using lumpy soil. The summer temperature may range about 68° or 70° by night,
                    with an increase of 10° by day. The plants will go to rest towards autumn, and
                    when the leaves have all died away the soil may be allowed to become nearly dry,
                    and the pots may be set on a shelf, in a temperature of about 55°, till
                    February.</p>
                <p>105. <hi rend="italic">Coleus.—</hi> These are very ornamental plants, the
                    colourof their leaves being exceedingly varied, and often very brilliant. They
                    are of the easiest culture. The cuttings of young shoots should be propagated
                    every year, about March, being planted in thumb pots, in sandy loam, and placed
                    in a close temperature of 70°. After taking root they should be shifted into
                    6-ineh pots, using ordinary light loamy compost, containing abun&lt;lanee of
                    leaf-mould and sand, and keeping them near the light. They may be passed on into
                    larger pots as often as required, but 8-inch pots will be large enough for
                    general purposes, as they can be fed with liquid manure. The young spring-struck
                    plants like a warm growing atmosphere, but by midsummer they will bear more air
                    and stand in a greenhouse or conservatory. They should be wintered in a
                    temperature of 60° to 65°. The stopping of the young shoots must be regulated by
                    the consideration whether bushy or pyramidal plants are desired.</p>
                <p>106. <hi rend="italic">Dracaena.—</hi> These, are extremely useful as decorative
                    stove plants, and are easy to grow. They may be increased by cuttings planted in
                    sandy soil in a temperature of from 65° to 70° by night, the spring being the
                    best time for propagation. The old stems laid flat in a propagating frame will
                    push young shoots, which may be taken off with a heel when 2 or 3 inches long,
                    and planted in sandy peat in 3-inch pots; the tops can also be taken off and
                    struck. The established plants do best in fibry peat made porous by sand. In
                    summer they should have a day temperature of 75°, and in winter one of 65°.
                    Shift as required, using coarser soil as the pots become larger. By the end of
                    the summer the small cuttings will have made nice plants, and in the spring
                    following they can be kept growing by the use of manure water twice a week.
                    Those intended for the conservatory should be gradually inured to more air by
                    midsummer, but kept out of cold draughts. When the plants get too large they can
                    be headed down and the tops made cuttings. D. terminalis, with its bronzy leaves
                    and rosy variegation, still ranks amongst the best sorts, but there are also
                    many novel varieties of great merit and beauty. D. Goldieana is a grandly
                    variegated species from tropical Africa, and requires more heat.</p>
                <p>107. <hi rend="italic">Eucharis.—</hi> This is themost chastely beautifulof all
                    decorative plants, having white flowers, of a very distinct character. It is a
                    bulbous plant, and is propagated by removing the offsets, which may be done in
                    spring, potting them singly in 6-inch pots. It requires good loamy soil, with
                    sand enough to keep the compost open,and should have agood supply of water and a
                    temperature of 65° to 70° during the night, with a rise of 8° or 10° in the day.
                    During summer, growth is to be encouraged by repotting, but the plants should
                    afterwards be slightly rested by removal to a night temperature of about 60°,
                    water being withheld for a time, though they must not go too long dry, the plant
                    being an evergreen. By the turn of the year they may again have more heat and
                    more water, and this will probably induce them to flower. After this is over
                    they may be shifted and grown again as before; and, as they get large, they can
                    either be divided to form new plants or allowed to develop into nobler
                    specimens. With a stock of the smaller plants to start them in succession, they
                    may be had in flower all the year round.</p>
                <p>108. <hi rend="italic">Gloxinia. —</hi> The gloxinia, a charming decorative
                    plant,may be grown much in the same way as the achimenes. A good strain of seed
                    will produce many superb and charmingly coloured varieties, and if sown early in
                    spring, in a temperature of 65° at night, they may be shifted on into 6-inch
                    pots, and in these may be flowered during the summer. The bulbs are kept at rest
                    through the winter in a dry sand, in a temperature of 50°, and to yield a
                    succession should be started at intervals, say at the end of February and the
                    beginning of April. To prolong the blooming season, use weak manur e water when
                    the flower-buds show themselves.</p>
                <p>109. <hi rend="italic">Poinsettia.—</hi> The Poinsettia pulcherrima, with its
                    brilliant scarlet bracts, stands unrivalled amongst decorative plants. The
                    white-bracted sort, P. ’ p. alba, is not so effective, but the doubleflowered P.
                    p. plenissima, in which the cymose inflorescence is branched, is as brilliant as
                    the type, and keeps long in flower. They are increased by cuttings in spring,
                    which when taken off with a heel strike freely in a brisk heat. They require
                    good turfy loam, with an addition of one-sixth of leaf-mould and a little sand,
                    and should be kept in a heat of from 65° to 70° at night, with a rise of 10° by
                    day. To prevent their growing lanky, they should be kept with their heads almost
                    touching the glass; and as the pots get filled with roots they must be shifted
                    into others, 8 inches or 10 inches in diameter. About August they may be inured
                    to a heat of 50° at night, and should be brought to bear air night and day
                    whilst the weather is warm, or they may be placed out of doors for a month under
                    a south wall in the full sun. This treatment matures and prepares them for
                    flowering. In autumn they must be removed to a house where the temperature is
                    50° at night, and by the end of September some of them may be put in the stove,
                    where they will come into flower, the remainder being placed under heat later
                    for succession. When in bloom they may be kept at about 55° by night, and so
                    placed will last longer than if kept in a higher temperature.</p>
                <p>110. <hi rend="italic">Tydoea.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These handsome
                    plants, which have sprung from the beautiful Achimenes picta, require similar
                    treatment to achimenes, except that, being winter bloomers, they must be started
                    into growth at a different season, namely, the later spring months, as April and
                    May. The summer-blooming sorts, which should be started earliest, should, as
                    they come into flower, be removed to the conservatory. The autumn and winter
                    flowering sorts, being at first grown slowly in a gentle heat, must as they show
                    flower have a nice growing temperature of 70° or 75° afforded them with
                    abundance of light; manure tvater may be given once a week. The tubers should be
                    stored away dry in winter, like those of achimenes.</p>
                <p>111. <hi rend="smallcaps">Orchids.</hi> —For the successful cultivation of a
                    mixed collection of tropical orchids, it is necessary that two or three houses,
                    in which different temperatures can be maintained, should be provided. The
                    greater number of them are epiphytes or air plants, and heat and moisture afford
                    all or nearly all the nourishment they require. The plants themselves are the
                    better for being associated with such objects as ferns and palms, and the
                    appearance of the houses is greatly improved by theiι ’ being thus grouped.</p>
                <p>The East Indian orchid house takes in those species which are found in the warm
                    parts of the eastern hemisphere, as well as those from the hottest parts of the
                    western, and its temperature should range from about 75° to 85“ during the
                    summer or growing season, and from 65° to 70° during winter. The Mexican or
                    Brazilian orchid house accommodates the plants from the warm parts of South
                    America, and its temperature should range from about 65° to 75° during summer,
                    and from 60° to 65° in winter. A structure called the cool orchid house is set
                    apart for the accommodation of the many lovely mountain species from South
                    America and India, such as odontoglossums, masdevallias, &amp;c., and in this
                    the more uniform the temperature can be kept the better, that in summer varying
                    between 60° and 7 0°, and in winter from 45° to 60°. A genial moist atmosphere
                    must be kept up in the hottest houses during the growing season, with a free
                    circulation of air admitted very cautiously by well-guarded ventilators. In
                    winter, when the plants are at rest, little water will be necessary; but in the
                    case of those plants which have no fleshy pseudobulbs to fall back upon for
                    sustenance, they must not be suffered to become so dry as to cause the leaves to
                    shrivel. In the Mexican house the plants will generally be able to withstand
                    greater drought occasionally, being greatly assisted by their thick pseudobulbs.
                    In the cool or odontoglossum house a considerable degree of moisture must be
                    maintained at all times, for in these the plants keep growing more or less
                    continuously.</p>
                <p>For potting or basketing purposes, or for plants requiring blockculture, the only
                    materials admissible are light fibrous peat and living sphagnum moss, which
                    supply free drainage for the copious supply of water required. The water should,
                    however, be so used as not to run down into the sheathing bases of the leaves.
                    While in flower, orchids may with advantage be removed to a drier and cooler
                    situation, and may be utilized in the drawing-room or boudoir.</p>

                    for the drawing-room and the dinner table. When more fully developed, and long
                    before their full growth is attained, they are among the best ornamental
                    foliaged conservatory plants. For the most part they are stove plants (75° to
                    80°), but after the growth is matured, many of them thrive for some time in the
                    temperature of a dwelling house. They are of very easy cultivation, but require
                    plenty of water and thorough drainage. The soil should consist of equal parts of
                    loam, peat, and vegetable mould, with abundance of sand, and they thrive best in
                    comparatively small pots. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Palms.</hi></p>

                <p>113. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferns.</hi> —These popular plants are usually increased
                    by means of their spores, the “dust” produced on the back of their fronds. The
                    spores should be sown in well-drained pots or seed pans on the surface of a
                    mixture of fibrous sifted peat and small broken crocks or sandstone; this soil
                    should be firmly pressed and well-watered, and the spores scattered over it, and
                    at once covered with propagating glasses or pieces of sheet glass, to prevent
                    water or dry air getting to the surface. The pots should be placed in pans full
                    of water, which they will absorb as required. A shady place is desirable, with
                    temperature of 50° to 55° by night and 65° to 70° by day, or they may be set on
                    a shelf in an ordinary propagating pit. The spores may be sown as soon as ripe,
                    and when the young plants can be handled, or rather can be lifted with the end
                    of a pointed flat stick, they should be pricked out into well-drained pots or
                    pans filled with similar soil, and should be kept moist and shady. As they
                    become large enough, pot them singly in 3-inch pots, and when the pots are
                    fairly filled with roots shift on into larger ones.</p>
                <p>The best time for a general repotting of ferns is in spring, just before growth
                    commences. Those with creeping rhizomes can be propagated by dividing these into
                    well-rooted portions, and, if a number of crowns is formed, they can be divided
                    at that season. In most cases this can be performed with little risk, but the
                    glei-chenias, for example, must only be cut into large portions, as small
                    divisions of the rhizomes are almost certain to die; in such cases, however, the
                    points of the rhizomes can be led over and layered into small pots, several in
                    succession, and allowed to remain unsevered from the parent plant until they
                    become well-rooted. In potting the well-established plants, and all those of
                    considerable size, the soil should be used in a rough turfy state, not sifted
                    but broken, and one-sixth of broken crocks or charcoal and as much sand as will
                    insure free percolation should be mixed with it.</p>
                <p>The stove ferns require a day temperature of 65° to 75°, but do not thrive in an
                    excessively high or close dry atmosphere. They require only such shade as will
                    shut out the direct rays of the sun, and, though abundant moisture must be
                    supplied, the atmosphere should not be loaded with it. The water used, should
                    always be at or near the temperature of the house in which the plants are
                    growing. Some ferns, as the different kinds of Gymnogramma and Cheilanthes,
                    prefer a drier atmosphere than others, and the former do not well bear a lower
                    winter temperature than about 60° by night. Most other stove ferns, if dormant,
                    will bear a temperature as low as 55° by night and 60° by day from November to
                    February. About the end of the latter month the whole collection should be
                    turned out of the pots, and redrained or repotted into larger pots as required.
                    This should take place before growth has commenced. Towards the end of March the
                    night temperature may be raised to 60°, and the day temperature to 70°or 75°,
                    the plants being shadedin bright weather. Such ferns as Gymnogrammas, which have
                    their surface covered with golden or silver powder, and certain species of
                    scaly-surfaced Cheilanthes and Nothochlaepa, as they cannot bear to have their
                    fronds wetted, should never be syringed; but most other ferns may have a
                    moderate sprinkling occasionally (not necessarily daily), and as the season
                    advances, sufficient air and light must be admitted to solidify the tissues.</p>
                <p>Space will only permit that we should append a list of choice ferns, which,
                    however, might be much extended. We shall arrange them under the heads of stove,
                    greenhouse, and hardy.</p>

                <p>114. <hi rend="italic">Fruit Tree Borders.—</hi> No pains should be spared, in
                    the preparation of fruit tree borders, to secure their thorough drainage. The
                    soil is sometimes placed upon a pavement flooring supported by stone or brick
                    piers, with a cavity below of 18 inches or 2 feet deep, into which air is
                    admitted by small vertical eyes, placed along the edges of the walk, and covered
                    with open iron gratings. This arrangement is expensive, and the same advantages
                    can generally be secured by placing over the sloping bottom a good layer of
                    coarse rubbly material, communicating with a drain in front to carry off the
                    water, while earthenware drain tubes may be laid beneath the rubble from 8 to 10
                    feet apart, so as to form air drains, and provided with openings both at the
                    side of the walk and also near the base of the wall. Over this rubbly matter,
                    rough turfy soil, grass-side downwards, should be laid, and on this the good
                    prepared soil in which the trees are to be planted. Such an elaborate system of
                    drainage is necessary only in the case of adhesive clayey subsoils.</p>
                <p>The borders should consist of three parts rich turfy calcareous loam, the top
                    spit of a pasture, and one part light gritty earth, such as road-grit, with a
                    small portion (one-sixth) of fine lime and brick rubbish. They should not be
                    less than 12 feet in breadth, and may vary up to 15 or 18 feet, with a fall from
                    the wall of about 1 inch in 3 feet. The border itself should be raised a foot or
                    more above the general level. The bottom of the border as well as that of the
                    drain must be kept lower than the general level of the subsoil, else the soakage
                    will gather in all the little depressions<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0280-0269"/> of its surface. Fruit-tree borders should not be
                    at all cropped with culinary vegetables, or very slightly so, as the process of
                    digging destroys the roots of the trees, and drives them from near the surface,
                    where they ought to be.</p>
                <p>Shallow planting, whether of wall trees or standards, is generally to be
                    preferred, a covering of a few inches of soil being sufficient for the roots,
                    but a surface of at least equal size to the surface of the hole should be
                    covered with dung or litter so as to restrain evaporation and preserve moisture.
                    In the case of wall trees, a space of 5 or 6 inches is usually left between the
                    stem at the insertion of the roots and the wall, to allow for increase of girth.
                    Young standard trees should be tied to stakes so as to prevent their roots being
                    ruptured by the wind-waving of the stems.</p>
                <p>In the selection and distribution of fruit trees regard must of course be had to
                    local situation and climate. The best walls having a south or south-east aspect
                    are devoted to the peach, apricot, and fig. Cherries and the generality of plums
                    succeed very well either on an east or a west aspect. In Scotland the mulberry
                    requires the protection of a wall, and several of the finer apples and pears do
                    not arrive at perfection without this help, and a tolerably good aspect. The
                    wall-trees intended to be permanent are called dwarfs, from their branches
                    springing from near the ground. Between these, trees with tall stems, called
                    riders, are planted as temporary occupants of the upper part of the wall. The
                    riders should have been trained in the nursery into good-sized trees, in order
                    that when planted out they may come into bearing as speedily as possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Standard Fruit Trees</hi> should not be planted, if it can be
                    avoided, in the borders of the kitchen garden, but in the outer slips, where
                    they either may be allowed to attain their full size, or may be kept dwarfed.
                    Each sort of fruit should be planted by itself, for the sake of orderly
                    arrangement, and in order to facilitate protection when necessary by a covering
                    of nets. Their produce is often superior in flavour to that of the same kind of
                    fruit grown on walls.</p>
                <p>115. The <hi rend="italic">Almond,</hi> Amygdalus communis, is very ornamental in
                    respect to its flowers in the early spring months, hut of little value for its
                    fruit. There are two varieties, one producing large flowers and sweet-kernelled
                    fruits, and the other small flowers and bitter kernels. Every good garden should
                    contain a tree or two, especially of the sweet almond, for their ornamental
                    aspect in spring. The almond requires a warm light soil, well drained, and a
                    sheltered position and warm aspect. It is propagated by budding on the seedling
                    almond, or for heavier soils on the plum stock. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Almond,</hi> vol. i. p. 594.</p>
                <p>116. The <hi rend="italic">Apple,</hi> Pyrus Malus, is amongst the most useful of
                    all our hardy fruits, and succeeds in localities too cold for either the pear or
                    the plum, while from its flowering later in the spring it is less liable to be
                    cut off by frosts.</p>
                <p>It may be propagated by seeds to obtain stocks for grafting, and also for the
                    production of new varieties. The established sorts are usually increased by
                    grafting, the method called whip-grafting being preferred. The stocks should be
                    at least as thick as the finger; and should bo headed back to where the graft is
                    to be fixed in January, unless the weather is frosty, but in any case before
                    vegetation becomes active. The scions should be cut about the same time, and
                    laid in firmly in a trench, in contact with the moist soil, until required.</p>
                <p>The apple-tree will thrive in any good well-drained soil, the best being a good
                    mellow calcareous loam, while the less iron there is in the subsoil the better.
                    The addition of marl to soils that are not naturally calcareous very much
                    improves them. The trees are liable to canker in undrained soils or those of a
                    hot sandy nature. Where the soil is not naturally rich enough, it should be well
                    manured, but not to the extent of encouraging over-luxuriance. It is better to
                    apply manure in the form of a compost than to use it in a fresh state or
                    unmixed.</p>
                <p>To form an orchard, standard trees should be planted at from 25 to 40 feet
                    between the rows, according to the fertility of the soil and other
                    considerations. The trees should be selected with clean, straight,
                    self-supporting stems, and the head should be shapely and symmetrical, with the
                    main branches well balanced. In order to obtain such a stem, all the leaves on
                    the first shoot from the graft or bud should be encouraged to grow, and in the
                    second season the terminal bud should be allowed to develop a further leading
                    shoot, while the lateral shoots should be allowed to grow, but so that they do
                    not compete with the leader, on which the growth of leaves should be encouraged
                    in order that they may give additional strength to the stem below them. The side
                    shoots should be removed gradually, so that the diminution of foliage in this
                    direction may not exceed the increase made by the new branches and shoots of the
                    upper portion. Dwarf pyramids, which occupy less space than open dwarfs, if not
                    allowed to grow tall, may be planted at from 10 to 12 feet apart. Dwarf bush
                    trees may be planted from 10 to 15 feet apart, according to the variety and the
                    soil. Dwarf bushes on the Paradise stock are both ornamental and useful in small
                    gardens, the trees being always conveniently under control. These bush trees,
                    which must be on the proper stock—the French Paradise—may be planted at first 6
                    feet apart, with the same distance between the rows, the space being afterwards
                    increased, if desired, to 12 feet apart, by removing every alternate row.</p>
                <p>“Cordons” are trees trained to a single shoot, the laterals of which are kept
                    spurred. They are usually trained horizontally, at about 1⅜ feet from the
                    ground, and may consist of one stem or of two, the stems in the latter case
                    being trained in opposite directions. In cold districts the finer sorts of
                    apples may be grown against walls as upright or oblique cordons. From these
                    cordon trees very fine fruit may often be obtained. The apple may also be grown
                    as an espalier tree, a form which does not require much lateral space. The
                    ordinary trained trees for espaliers and walls should be planted 20 feet
                    apart.</p>
                <p>The fruit of the apple is produced on spurs which form on the branchlets of two
                    years old and upwards, and continue fertile for a series of years. The principal
                    pruning should be performed in summer, the young shoots if crowded being thinned
                    out, and the superabundant laterals shortened by breaking them half through. The
                    general winter pruning of the trees may take place any time from the beginning
                    of November to the beginning of March, in open weather. The trees are rather
                    subject to the attacks of the American blight <hi rend="italic">{Eriosoma
                    mali),</hi> which may be removed by scrubbing with a hard brush, by painting the
                    affected spots with any bland oil, or by washing them with dilute paraffin and
                    soft soap.</p>
                <p>The following are a few of the most approved varieties of the apple tree,
                    arranged in the order of their ripening, with the months in which they are in
                    use:—</p>

                <p>117. The <hi rend="italic">Apricot,</hi> Prunus Armeniaca or Armeniaca vulgaris,
                    is propagated by budding on the mussel or common plum stock. The .tree succeeds
                    in good well-drained loamy soil, rather light than heavy. It is usually grown as
                    a wall tree, the east and west aspects being preferred to the south, which
                    induces mealiness in the fruit, though in Scotland the best aspects are
                    necessary. The most usual and best mode of training is the fan method in the
                    modified form represented in par. 26, under fig. 83. The fruit is produced on
                    shoots of the preceding year, and on small close spurs formed on the
                    two-year-old wood. The trees should be planted about 20 feet apart. The summer
                    pruning should commence early in June, at which period all the irregular
                    fore-right and useless shoots are to be pinched off; and, shortly afterwards,
                    those which remain are to be fastened to the wall. At the winter pruning all
                    branches not duly furnished with spurs and fruit buds are to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0281-0270"/> removed. The young bearing shoots are moderately
                    pruned at the points, care being, however, taken to leave a terminal shoot or
                    leader to each branch. The most common error in the pruning of apricots is
                    laying in the bearing shoots too thickly; the branches naturally diverge in fan
                    training, and when they extend so as to be about 15 inches apart, a fresh branch
                    should be laid in, to be again subdivided as required. The blossoms of the
                    apricot open early in spring, but are more hardy than those of the peach; the
                    same means of protection when necessary may be employed for both. If the fruit
                    sets too numerously, it is thinned out in June and in the beginning of July, the
                    later thinnings being used for tarts. In the south of England, where the soil is
                    suitable, the hardier sorts of apricot, as the Breda and Brussels bear well as
                    standard trees in favourable seasons. In such cases the trees may be planted
                    from 20 to 25 feet apart.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing. —</hi> The ripening of the fruit of the apricot may be
                    accelerated by culture under glass, the trees being either planted out like
                    peaches, or grown in pots on the orchard-house system. They must be very gently
                    excited, since they naturally bloom when the spring temperature is comparatively
                    low. At first a maximum of 40° only must be permitted; after two or three weeks
                    it may be raised to 45°, and later on to 50° and 55°, and thus continued till
                    the trees are in flower, air being freely admitted, and the minimum or night
                    temperature ranging from 40° to 45°. After the fruit is set the temperature
                    should be gradually raised, being kept higher in clear weather than in dull.
                    When the fruit has stoned, the temperature may be raised to 60° or 65° by day
                    and 60° by night; and for ripening off it may be allowed to reach 70° or 80° by
                    sun heat.</p>
                <p>The Moorpark is undoubtedly the best apricot in cultivation, and should be
                    planted for all general purposes; the Peach is a very similar variety, not quite
                    identical; and the Hemskerk is also similar, but hardier. The Large Early, which
                    ripens in the end of July and beginning of August, and the Kaisha, a
                    sweet-kernelled variety, which ripens in the middle of August, are also to be
                    recommended. For standard trees in favourable localities the Breda and Brussels
                    may be added. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Apricot,</hi> vol. ii. p. 214.</p>
                <p>118. The <hi rend="italic">Cherry,</hi> Cerasus avium and C. vulgaris, is
                    increased by budding on the wild gean, obtained by sowing the stones of the
                    small black or red wild cherries. To secure very dwarf trees, the Cerasus
                    Mahaleb has been used for the May Duke, Kentish, Morello, and analogous sorts,
                    but it is not adapted for strong-growing varieties like the Bigarreaus. The
                    stocks are budded, or, more rarely, grafted, at the usual seasons. The cherry
                    prefers a free, loamy soil, with a well-drained subsoil. Stiff soils and dry
                    gravelly subsoils are both unsuitable, though the trees require a large amount
                    of moisture, particularly the large-leaved sorts, such as the Bigarreaus. For
                    standard trees, the Bigarreau section should be planted 30 feet apart, or more
                    in rich soil, and the May Duke, Morello, and similar varieties 20 or 25 feet
                    apart; while, as trained trees against walls and espaliers, from 20 to 24 feet
                    should be allowed for the former, and from 15 to 20 feet for the latter.</p>
                <p>In forming the stems of a standard tree, the temporary side-shoots should not be
                    allowed to attain too great a length, and should not be more than two years old
                    when they are cut close to the stem. The first three shoots retained to form the
                    head should be shortened to about 15 inches, and two shoots from each
                    encouraged, one at the end, and the other 3 or 4 inches lower down. When these
                    have become established, very little pruning will be required, and that chiefly
                    to keep the principal branches as nearly equal in strength as possible for the
                    first few years.</p>
                <p>Espalier trees should have the branches about a foot apart, starting from the
                    stem with an upward curve, and then being trained horizontally. In summer
                    pruning the shoots on the upper branches must be shortened at least a week
                    before those on the lower ones. After a year or two clusters of fruit buds will
                    be developed on spurs along the branches, and those spurs will continue
                    productive for an indefinite period.</p>
                <p>For wall trees any form of training may be adopted; but as the fruit is always
                    finest on young spurs, fan-training is probably the most advantageous. A
                    succession of young shoots should be laid in every year. The Morello, which is
                    of twiggy growth, and bears on the young wood, must be trained in the fan form,
                    and care should be taken to avoid the very common error of crowding its
                    branches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing. —</hi> The cherry will not endure a high temperature
                    nor a close atmosphere. A heat of 45° at night will be sufficient at starting,
                    this being gradually increased during the first few weeks to 55°, but lowered
                    again when the blossom buds are about to open. After stoning the temperature may
                    be again gradually raised to 60°, and may go up to 70° by day, or 75° by sun
                    heat, and 60° at night. The best forcing cherries are the May Duke and the Royal
                    Duke, the Duke cherries being of more compact growth than the Bigarreau tribe,
                    and generally setting better; nevertheless a few of the larger kinds, such as
                    Bigarreau Napoléon, Black Tartarian, and St Margaret’s, should be forced for
                    variety. The trees may be either planted out in tolerably rich soil, or grown in
                    large pots of good turfy friable calcareous loam mixed with rotten dung. If the
                    plants are small, they may be put into 12-inch pots in the first instance, and
                    after a year shifted into 15-inch pots early in autumn, and plunged in some
                    loose or even very slightly fermenting material. The soil of the pots should be
                    protected from snow-showers and cold rains. Occasionally trees have been taken
                    up in autumn with balls, potted, and forced in the following spring; but those
                    which have been established a year in the pots are to be preferred. Such only as
                    are well furnished with blossom-buds should be selected. The trees should be
                    removed to the forcing house in the beginning of December, if fruit be required
                    very early in the season. During the first and second weeks it may be kept
                    nearly close; but, as vegetation advances, air becomes absolutely necessary
                    during the day, and even at night when the weather will permit. If forcing is
                    commenced about the middle or third week of December, the fruit ought to be ripe
                    by about the end of March. After the fruit is gathered, the trees should be duly
                    supplied with water at the root, and the foliage kept well syringed till the
                    wood is mature.</p>

                <p>119. <hi rend="italic">The Cranberry.—</hi> The American cranberry, Oxycoccus
                    macrocarpus, grows freely in beds of peat soil or bog earth formed for their
                    reception in any damp situation. Beds are often prepared around the edges of a
                    pond by depositing a layer of rubble or stones at the bottom, and over these a
                    good thickness of peat or bog earth mixed with sand, extending about 6 inches
                    below and about 4 inches above the usual level of the water surface. On this bed
                    tho cranberry plants should be put in at 2 feet apart, in autumn or spring;
                    spreading in all directions, they will soon cover the whole surface with a dense
                    mat of trailing shoots.</p>
                <p>The common cranberry, Oxycoccus palustris, a native of Britain, bears fruit which
                    is inferior to that of the American cranberry in size and quality. The plants
                    may be treated in the same manner, and in some places are very successfully
                    cultivated. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cranberry,</hi> vol. vi. p. 545.</p>
                <p>120. The <hi rend="italic">Currants</hi> are among the most useful of small
                    fruits. The red and the white currant are included as varieties under Ribes
                    rubrum, the white being a pale-fruited variety of the red. The black currant is
                    the produce of Ribes nigrum. Of both types there are several greatly improved
                    varieties.</p>
                <p>Red and white currants are readily propagated by cuttings. They succeed in any
                    well-enriched garden soil, but thrive best in warm moist situations, where they
                    enjoy an abundance of air; occasionally they are trained perpendicularly against
                    low walls or fences. As bushes they are best planted in compartments by
                    themselves, at about 5 or 6 feet apart each way, and should be on clean single
                    stems some 8 or 10 inches long. They are sometimes trained as standards on
                    single stems, 3 or 4 feet high, in which form the fruit is more accessible. The
                    winter pruning consists in shortening the young bearing wood on the sides of the
                    branches so as to form spurs of an inch or two in length. The leading shoots are
                    left about 6 inches long. Some cultivators reduce the young shoots to about half
                    their length as soon as the fruit begins to colour, which is found to increase
                    the size and improve the flavour of the berries.</p>
                <p>The black currant thrives best in a moist deep soil and shady situation. Its
                    culture is much the same as that of the other currants, but the young shoots are
                    not spurred, all the pruning necessary being to keep the branches thinned out so
                    as to stand clear of each other, and to promote the formation of young wood. If
                    the fruit is intended for preserving, it should not be gathered while wet, nor,
                    if it can be avoided, immediately after a wet period.</p>
                <p>Aphides often cluster in vast numbers at the extremities of the summer shoots,
                    especially of red and white currants, and should be destroyed by cutting off and
                    burning the parts infested, or by applying some of the many insecticides.</p>
                <p>The following are the best sorts of currants for general purposes:—</p>

                <p>121. The <hi rend="italic">Fig,</hi> Ficus Carica, lives to a great age, and
                    along the southern coast of England bears fruit abundafltly as a standard; but
                    in Scotland and in many parts of England a south wall is indispensable for its
                    successful cultivation out of doors.</p>
                <p>Fig trees are propagated by cuttings, which should be put into pots, and placed
                    in a gentle hotbed. They may be obtained more speedily from layers, which should
                    consist of two or three years old snoots, and these, when rooted, will form
                    plants ready to bear fruit the first or second year after planting. The best
                    soil for a fig border is a friable loam, not too rich, but well drained; a
                    chalky subsoil is congenial to the tree, and, to correct the tendency to
                    overluxuriance of growth, the roots should be confined within spaces surrounded
                    by a wall enclosing an area of about a square yard. The sandy soil of
                    Argenteuil, near Paris, suits the fig remarkably well; but the best trees are
                    those which grow in old quarries, where their roots are free from stagnant
                    water, and where they are sheltered from cold, while exposed to a very hot sun,
                    which ripens the fruit perfectly. The fig succeeds well planted in a paved court
                    against a building with a south aspect.</p>
                <p>The fig tree naturally produces two sets of shoots and two crops of fruit in the
                    season. The first shoots generally show young figs in July and August, but these
                    in the climate of England very seldom ripen, and should therefore be rubbed off.
                    The late or midsummer shoots likewise put forth fruit-buds, which, however, do
                    not develop themselves till the following spring; and these form the only crop
                    of figs on which the British gardener can depend.</p>
                <p>The fig tree grown as a standard should get very little pruning, the effect of
                    cutting being to stimulate the buds to push shoots too vigorous for bearing.
                    When grown against a wall, it has been recommended that a single stem should be
                    trained to the height of a foot. Above this a shoot should be trained to the
                    right, and another to the left; from these principals two other subdivisions
                    should be encouraged, and trained 15 inches apart; and along these branches, at
                    distances of about 8 inches, shoots for bearing, as nearly as possible of equal
                    vigour, should be encouraged. The bearing shoots produced along the leading
                    branches should be trained in at full· length, and in autumn every alternate one
                    should be cut back to one eye. In the following summer the trained shoots should
                    bear and ripen fruit, and then be cut back in autumn to one eye, while shoots
                    from the bases of those cut back the previous autumn should be trained for
                    succession. In this way every leading branch will be furnished alternately with
                    bearing and successional shoots.</p>
                <p>When protection is necessary, as it may be in severe winters, though it is too
                    often provided in excess, spruce branches have been found to answer the purpose
                    exceedingly well, owing to the fact that their leaves drop off gradually when
                    the weather becomes milder in spring, and when the trees require less protection
                    and more light and air. The principal part requiring protection is the main
                    stem, which is more tender than the young wood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The fig requires more heat than the vine to
                    bring it into leaf. It may be subjected to a temperature of 50° at night, and
                    from 60° to 65° in the day, and this should afterwards be increased to 60° and
                    65° by night, and 70° to 75° by day, or even higher by sun heat, giving plenty
                    of air at the same time. In this temperature the evaporation from the leaves is
                    very great, and this must be replaced and the wants of the swelling fruit
                    supplied by daily watering, by syringing the foliage, and by moistening the
                    floor, this atmospheric moisture being also necessary to keep down the red
                    spider. When the crop begins to ripen, a moderately dry atmosphere should be
                    maintained, with abundant ventilation when the weather permits.</p>
                <p>The fig tree is easily cultivated in pots, and by introducing the plants into
                    heat in succession the fruiting season may be considerably extended.. The plants
                    should be potted in turfy loam mixed with charcoal and old mortar rubbish, and
                    in summer topdressings of rotten manure, with manure water two or three times a
                    week, will be beneficial. While the fruit is swelling, the pots should be
                    plunged in a bed of fermenting leaves.</p>

                    Grossularia being the parent of the rough or hairy-fruited sorts, and R.
                    Uva-crispa that of the smooth-fruited ones. It prefers a loose rich soil, which
                    readily imbibes, but does not retain, much moisture. The plant is propagated by
                    cuttings, and should be transplanted early in autumn, the trees, like those of
                    the currant, being ranged in lines or grouped in compartments. The trees should
                    be formed with single stems a foot high; and the suckers, if any spring up from
                    the. roots, should be carefully removed. Formerly it was the practice in
                    Scotland to spur all the annual wood; but now the black currant system of
                    pruning is more generally and advantageously followed. The ground on which the
                    bushes stand should be forked over once a year, but only slightly, so as not to
                    disturb the roots, and manure should be applied either as <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> top-dressing or in a liquid form. The caterpillars which attack the
                    plant may be destroyed by dusting the leaves with powdered white hellebore,
                    which seems tobe the only certain remedy, as even hand-picking fails in some
                    seasons when the caterpillars are very abundant, and the trees are numerous.</p>
                <p>The gooseberry, like the currant, may be trained on walls or espaliers, to
                    accelerate the ripening or increase the size of the fruit. The following is a

                <p>123. The <hi rend="italic">Medlar,</hi> Mespilus germanica, is a deciduous tree,
                    native of the middle and south of Europe, and found in hedges and woods in
                    England. Its fruit is hard, acid, and unfit for eating till it loses its green
                    colour and becomes “bletted,” in which state it acquires an agreeably acid and
                    somewhat astringent flavour.</p>
                <p>The medlar is propagated by budding or grafting upon the whitethorn, which is
                    most suitable if the soil is dry and sandy, or on the quince if the soil is
                    moist. It produces the best fruit in rich, loamy, somewhat moist ground. The
                    tree maybe grown as a standard, and chiefly requires pruning to prevent the
                    branches from crossing and rubbing each other. The fruit should be gathered in
                    November, on a dry day, and laid out upon shelves in the fruit room. It becomes
                    bletted and fit for use in the course of two or three weeks.</p>
                <p>124. The <hi rend="italic">Melon,</hi> Cucumis Melo, is an annual tropical plant
                    of climbing or trailing habit, extensively cultivated in Persia and some parts
                    of India. The plant requires artificial heat to grow it to perfection, the rock
                    and cantaloup varieties succeeding with a bottom heat of 70° and an atmospheric
                    temperature of 75°, rising with sun heat to 80°, and the Persian varieties
                    requiring a bottom heat of 75°, gradually increasing to 80°, and an atmospheric
                    temperature ranging from 75° to 80° when the fruit is swelling, as much sun heat
                    as the plants can bear being allowed at all times. The melon grows best in rich
                    turfy loam, somewhat heavy, with which a little well-rotted dung, especially
                    that of pigeons or fowls, should be used, in the proportion of one-fifth mixed
                    in the compost of loam. Melons are grown on hotbeds of fermenting manure, when
                    the soil should be about a foot in thickness, or in pits heated either by hot
                    water or fermenting matter, or in houses heated by hot water, in which case the
                    soil bed should be 15 or 18 inches thick. The fermenting materials should be
                    well prepared, and, since the heat has to be kept up by linings, it is a good
                    plan to introduce one or two layers of faggots in building up the bed. A mixture
                    of dung and leaves gives a more subdued but more durable heat.</p>
                <p>For all ordinary purposes February is early enough for sowing the first crop, as
                    well-flavoured fruits can scarcely be looked for before May. The seeds maybe
                    sown singly in 3-inch pots in a mixture of leaf-mould with a little loam, the
                    pots being plunged in a bottom heat of 75° to 80°, and as near the glass as
                    possible, in order that the young plants may not be drawn up. The hill or ridge
                    of soil should be about a foot in thickness, the rest of the surface being
                    afterwards made up nearly to the same level. If the fruiting bed is not ready
                    when the roots have nearly filled the pots, they must be shifted into 4-inch
                    pots, for on no account must they be allowed to get starved or pot-bound. Two or
                    three plants are usually planted in a mound or ridge of soil placed in the
                    centre of each light, and the rest of the surface is covered over to a similar
                    depth as soon as the roots have made their way through the mound.</p>
                <p>The mode of pruning and training is similar whether the plants are grown on a
                    trellis or on the surface of a bed, with this difference that in the former case
                    the main stem has to be carried up to a sufficient height to reach the trellis
                    before it is stopped. When the plants are trained on the surface of the beds the
                    tops should be pinched off as soon as the second rough leaf is fairly formed,
                    the stopping being effected either long enough before planting to allow the buds
                    to break, or not until the plants have taken fresh root after planting. One
                    branch will thus be developed from the axil of each <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0283-0272"/> of the two leaves, and they should be trained one
                    towards the front and the other towards the back of the frame, before reaching
                    which the points should be pinched off and lateral fruit-bearing shoots will
                    then be produced.</p>
                <p>The melon being one of those plants which produce distinct male and female
                    flowers (dioecious), it is necessary to its fertility that both should be
                    produced, and that the pollen of the male flower should, either naturally by
                    insect agency, or artificially by the cultivator’s manipulation, be conveyed to
                    the stigma of the female flower; this setting of the fruit is often done by
                    stripping a male flower of its corolla, and inverting it in the centre of the
                    fruit-bearing flower. After the fruit has set and has grown to the size of an
                    <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> it should be preserved from contact with the soil by
                    placing it on a piece of tile or slate; or if grown on a trellis by a little
                    swinging wooden shelf, just large enough to hold it. In either case the material
                    used should be tilted a little to one side, so as to permit water-to drain away.
                    Before the process of ripening commences, the roots should have a sufficient
                    supply of moisture, so that none maybe required from that time until the fruit
                    is cut.</p>
                <p>When the melon is grown in a house there should be a good depth of drainage over
                    the tank or other source of bottom heat, and on this should be placed turfs,
                    grass side downwards, below the soil, which should not be less than 15 and need
                    not be more than 18 inches in thickness. The compost should be made moderately
                    firm, and only half the bed should be made up at first, the rest being added as
                    the roots require it. The melon may also be grown in large pots, supplied with
                    artificial manure or manure water. The stems may Be trained up the trellis in
                    the usual way, or the rafters of a pine stove may be utilized for the purpose.
                    If the trellis is constructed in panels about the width of the lights, it can be
                    taken down and conveniently stowed away when not in use.</p>
                <p>The presence of too much moisture either in the atmosphere or in the soil is apt
                    to cause the plants to damp off at the neck, but the evil, if it appears, may be
                    checked by applying a little fresh-slaked lime round the stem of the plant.</p>
                <p>The varieties of melon are continually receiving additions which are more or less
                    permanent. A great deal depends on getting the varieties true tc name, as they
                    are very liable to get cross-fertilized by insect agency. Some of the best
                    are—</p>

                <p>125. The <hi rend="italic">Mulberry,</hi> Morus nigra, is a deciduous tree, with
                    monoecious flowers, and oblong compound fruits, having a rich aromatic flavour
                    and a fine subacid juice. The fruit is in request for the dessert during the
                    months of August and September. It is a native of Persia, and succeeds well as a
                    standard in the warmer parts of England, especially in sheltered situations, but
                    in the north of England and the less favoured parts of Scotland it requires the
                    assistance of a wall. The standard trees require no other pruning or training
                    than an occasional thinning out of the branches, and are generally planted on
                    grassy lawns, to prevent the fruit being damaged when it falls.</p>
                <p>The tree succeeds best in a rich, deep, and somewhat moist loam, but grows well
                    in any good garden ground. It is usually propagated either by cuttings or
                    layers, which latter, if made from the older branches of the tree, come sooner
                    into bearing. Cuttings planted in the spring should consist of well-ripened
                    shoots of the preceding year, with a joint of two-year-old wood at their base,
                    or if planted in autumn should have the shoots well matured, and furnished with
                    a heel of two-year-old wood. The branches and even stout limbs are sometimes
                    employed as cuttings instead of the younger shoots, especially when the objectis
                    to obtain a bearing tree quickly. The branch should be planted deeply in autumn
                    in good soil, and if necessary supported in an upright position by a stake. The
                    most common mode of propagation, however, is by layering the young branches. The
                    mulberry may be grown in pots, and gently forwarded in an orchard house, and
                    under these conditions the fruit acquires a richness of flavour and a melting
                    character which is unknown in the fruit ripened outdoors. If cultivated in this
                    way it requires abundance of water while the fruit is swelling, and also
                    frequent dressings of artificial fertilizers or doses of liquid manure.</p>
                <p>126. The <hi rend="italic">Nectarine</hi> is merely a smooth-skinned variety of
                    the peach, and will be included under that head (see par. 129).</p>
                <p>127. The <hi rend="italic">Nut,</hi> Corylus Avellana, or hazel-nut, one of our
                    indigenous shrubs, is the parent of the Filberts, Cob Nuts, and other improved
                    varieties which are met with under cultivation. These succeed best in a rich dry
                    loam, deeply worked, and should receive from time to time a slight manuring.
                    They are generally planted in the slip, but thrive best in an open quarter by
                    themselves. The different varieties are propagated by layers, or more generally
                    by suckers; or, if required, they may be grafted. The Cosford is a favourite
                    kind, being a thin-shelled nut, and having a kernel of high flavour. If either
                    this or the filbert be grafted on small stocks of the Spanish nut, which grows
                    fast, and does not send out suckers, dwarfish prolific trees may be obtained;
                    and, by pruning the roots in autumn, the trees may be kept quite neat and
                    bushy.</p>
                <p>The county of Kent has long been celebrated for the culture of nuts for the
                    London market. The young plants are almost always suckers from old bushes, and
                    are planted from 10 to 12 feet apart, being subsequently kept from crowding or
                    shading each other by pruning. They are suffered to grow without restraint for
                    about three years, and then, being cut down to within 12 or 18 inches of the
                    ground, they will push out from near the top five or six shoots, whiςh at the
                    winter pruning in their second year are shortened one-third. A hoop of
                    sufficient diameter is then placed within the branches, and the shoots are
                    fastened to it at about equal distances. In the spring of the fourth year all
                    the laterals are cut back nearly to the principal stems, and from these cut-back
                    laterals short shoots proceed, on which fruit may be expected in the following
                    year. Those which have borne fruit are afterwards removed by the knife. The
                    leading shoots are always shortened about two-thirds. Every bearing twig is
                    deprived of its top, and all suckers are carefully rooted out.</p>
                <p>The nut being a monoecious plant, it is necessary in the winter or spring pruning
                    to take care that a sufficiency of the male flowers— those produced in pendulous
                    catkins—are preserved. The female flowers, which produce the fruit, are not
                    visible till spring, and appear in the form of plump buds, producing from their
                    apex several deep crimson threads, which are the styles to which the pollen from
                    the catkins should be applied.</p>
                <p>The best kinds of nuts for garden cultivation are Lambert's Filbert, the Red and
                    the White Filberts, the Cosford, the Norwich Prolific, and Pearson’s
                    Prolific.</p>
                <p>128. The <hi rend="italic">Orange,</hi> Citrus Aurantium, has been usually culti-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> vated in England for the beauty of the plant and
                    the fragrance of its blossoms, rather than for the purpose of affording a supply
                    of edible fruit. The latter can, however, be easily grown in a hot-house, some
                    of the fruits thus grown, especially those of the pretty little Tangierine
                    variety, being superior in quality to the imported fruit. The best form of
                    orange house is the span-roofed, with glass on both sides, the height and other
                    conditions being similar to those recommended for stove plants. The trees may be
                    planted out, a row on each side a central path, in a house of moderate width.
                    The borders must be carefully made, with a drainage bottom of from 9 to 12
                    inches of broken bricks or rubbly stones, and a drain leading to the exterior.
                    Rough turf with the grassy side downwards should be laid over the drainage
                    material, and then 18 inches of good turfy loam mixed with gritty sand or fine
                    burnt ballast, to keep it permeable to water. The trees, if intended to be
                    permanent, should be placed 10 to 12 feet apart. Bottom heat (about 80°) is
                    beneficial; but it is questionable if its advantages beneath a bed of soil are
                    not more than counterbalanced by the risk of over-dryness, and the inconvenience
                    of getting access to the heating pipes in case of repairs becoming necessary. It
                    will generally be found more convenient to grow the plants in pots or tubs, and
                    then bottom heat can be secured by placing them on or over a series of hot-water
                    pipes kept near to or above the ground level. The pots or tubs should be
                    thoroughly well drained. The temperature may be kept at about 50° or 55° in
                    winter, under which treatment the trees will come into bloom in February; the
                    heat must then be increased to 60° or 65° in the day time, and later on to 80°
                    or 85°. Throughout the growing season the trees should be liberally watered, and
                    thoroughly washed every day with the garden engine, care being taken not to
                    injure the young leaves; this will materially assist in keeping down insects.
                    The fruit may be expected to ripen from about the middle of October to January,
                    and if the sorts are good will be of excellent quality. When the trees are at
                    rest the soil must not be kept too wet, since this will produce a sickly
                    condition, through the loss of the small feeding roots. The trees require little
                    pruning or training. When a branch appears to be robbing the rest, or growing
                    ahead of them, it should be shortened back or tied down.</p>
                <p>When grown for the production of flowers, which are always in great request, the
                    plants must be treated in a similar manner to that already described, but may do
                    without bottom heat.</p>
                <p>The favourite sorts of oranges are the Tangierine, a delicious small-fruited
                    early variety; the Mandarin, which is larger than Tangierine; the St Michael’s,
                    which is the most commonly grown; the Maltese Blood, which is a very distinct
                    sort with red flesh; and the Plata or silver orange.</p>
                <p>129. The <hi rend="italic">Peach,</hi> Amygdalus Persica, or Persica vulgaris, is
                    one of the most delicious of exotic garden fruits. There are two principal
                    races, the <hi rend="italic">Peach</hi> proper, which has fruits covered with a
                    downy skin, and the <hi rend="italic">Nectarine,</hi> which has fruits covered
                    with a smooth skin. The peach and the nectarine would therefore appear to be
                    distinct kinds of fruit, and indeed have an appreciable difference of flavour;
                    but as both peaches and nectarines have been known to grow on the same branch,
                    and individuals half-peach half-nectarine have been produced, they must be
                    regarded as merely varieties oι one kind of fruit. Their treatment, moreover, is
                    the same in every respect.</p>
                <p>To perpetuate and multiply the choicer varieties, peaches and nectarines are
                    budded upon plum or almond stocks. For dry situations almond stocks are
                    preferable, but they are not long-lived, while for damp or clayey loams it is
                    better to use plums. Double-working<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0284-0273"/> is sometimes beneficial; thus an almond budded on
                    a plum stock may be rebudded with a tender peach, greatly to the advantage of
                    the latter. The peach border should be composed of turfy mellow loam, such as is
                    suitable for the vine and the fig; this should be used in as rough a state as
                    possible, or not broken small and fine. The bottom should slope towards the
                    outer edge, where a drain should be cut, with an outlet, and on this sloping
                    bottom should be laid a thickness of from 9 inches to 12 inches of rough
                    materials, such as broken bricks or mortar rubbish, over which should be placed
                    a layer of rough turf with the grassy side downwards, and then the good loamy
                    soil to form the border, which need not be of greater depth than 18 inches, for
                    the peach tree is most productive when the roots are kept near the surface. The
                    borders should not be cropped heavily with culinary vegetables, as deep
                    trenching is very injurious. Sickly and unfruitful trees may often be revived by
                    bringing up their roots within 5 or 6 inches of the surface. The experience of
                    the last few seasons has, however, been so disastrous that it has been
                    questioned whether it may not be better, in cold soils and bleak situations, to
                    abandon outdoor peach culture, and to cover the walls with a casing of glass, so
                    that the trees may be under shelter during the uncongenial spring weather.</p>
                <p>The fruit of the peach is produced on the ripened shoots of the preceding year.
                    If these be too luxuriant, they yield nothing but leaves; and if too weak, they
                    are incapable of developing flower buds. To furnish young shoots in sufficient
                    abundance, and of requisite strengt h, is the great object of peach training and
                    pruning. Trees of slender-growing, twiggy habit naturally fall most readily into
                    the fan form of training, and accordingly this has generally been adopted in the
                    culture of peaches and nectarines. The old fan form is very nearly that of fig.
                    82 (p. 245). The young tree is, in many cases, procured λvhen it has been
                    trained for two or three years in the nursery; but it is generally better to
                    commence with a maiden plant, that is, a plant of the first year after it has
                    been budded. It is then in ordinary practice headed down to five or six buds,
                    and in the following summer from two to four shoots, according to the vigour of
                    the plant, are trained in, the laterals from which, if any, are thinned out and
                    nailed to the wall. If there are four branches, the two central ones are
                    shortened back at the subsequent winter pruning so as to produce others, the two
                    lower ones being laid in nearly at full length. In the following season
                    additional shoots are sent forth; and the process is repeated till eight or ten
                    principal limbs or mother branches are obtained, forming, as it were, the
                    frame-work of the future tree. The branches may be depressed or elevated, so as
                    to check or encourage them, as occasion may arise; and it is highly advantageous
                    to keep them thin, without their becoming in any part deficient of young shoots.
                    Sometimes a more rapid mode of formation is now adopted, the main shoots being
                    from the first laid in nearly at full length, instead of being shortened. The
                    pruning for fruit consists in shortening back the laterals which had been nailed
                    in at the disbudding, or summer pruning, their length depending on their
                    individual vigour and the luxuriance of the tree. In well-developed shoots the
                    buds are generally double, or rather triple, a wood bud growing between two
                    fruit buds; the shoot must be cut back to one of these, or else to a wood bud
                    alone, so that a young shoot may be produced to draw up the sap beyond the
                    fruit, which is generally desirable to secure its proper swelling. The point of
                    this leading shoot is subsequently pinched off, that it may not draw away too
                    much of the sap. If the fruit sets too abundantly, it must be thinned, first
                    when as large as peas, reducing the clusters, and then when as large as nuts to
                    distribute the crop equally; the extent of the thinning must depend on the
                    vigour of the .tree, but one or two fruits ultimately left to each square foot
                    of wall is a full average crop. The final thinning should take place after
                    stoning.</p>
                <p>The best-placed healthy young shoot produced from the wood buds at the base of
                    the bearing branch is to be carefully preserved and in due time nailed to the
                    wall. In the following winter this will take the place of the branch which has
                    just borne, and is to be cut out. If there be no young shoot below, and the
                    bearing branch is short, the shoot at the point of the latter may sometimes be
                    preserved as a fruit bearer, though if the bearing branch be long it is better
                    to cut it back for young wood. It is the neglect of this which constitutes the
                    principal fault in carrying outthe English fan system, as it is usually
                    practised. Several times during summer the trees ought to be regularly examined,
                    and the young shoots respectively topped or thinned, outthose that remain are to
                    be nailed to the wall, or braced in with pieces of slender twigs, and the trees
                    ought occasionally to be washed with the garden engine.</p>
                <p>The Montreuil form of training is represented by fig. 87. The principal feature
                    is the suppression of the direct channel of the sap, and the substitution of
                    four or more commonly two mother branches, so laid to the wall that the central
                    angle contains about 90°. The other branches are all treated as subordinate
                    members. This form is open to the objection that, if the under branch should
                    die, the upper one cannot be brought down into its place.</p>
                <p>The form à la Dumontier (fig. 88), so called from its inventor, is merely a
                    refinement on the Montreuil method. The formation of the tree commences with the
                    inferior limbs and proceeds towards the centre, the branches being lowered from
                    time to time as the tree acquires strength. What is most worthy of notice in
                    this method is the management of the subordinates in the pruning for fruit. When
                    a shoot promises blossom, it is generally at some distance from the point of
                    insertion into the old wood, and the intermediate space is covered with wood
                    buds. All the latter, therefore, which are between the old wood <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and the blossom c in fig. 89, except the loιvest <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> are carefully removed <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&gt;yebourgconnement.</hi> This never fails to produce a shoot <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> the growth of which is favoured by destroying the useless
                    spray <hi rend="italic">e</hi> above the blossoms, and pinching off the points
                    of those which are necessary to perfect the fruit. A replacing shoot is thus
                    obtained, to which the whole is invariably shortened at the end of the year.</p>
                <p>Mr Seymour’s form (fig. 90) approaches more nearly to the French method than any
                    other practised in England, but the direct channel of the sap is not suppressed.
                    It will be seen that the bearing shoots are all on the upper side of the mother
                    branches, and that these bearing shoots are wholly reproduced once a year. The
                    one side of the annexed figure represents the tree after the winter pruning, the
                    other (left hand) side before it has undergone that operation. On the latter
                    side the young shoots will be seen to be in pairs, and at the winter pruning the
                    lower one, or that which has borne fruit, is cut out, and the other is brought
                    down into its place, and shortened to about 8 or 9 inches, care being taken to
                    cut at a wcod bud. At the summer disbudding those buds which are best placed and
                    at the same time nearest the base are left to supply the future year’s bearing
                    wood. Some object that the annual excision of the bearing shoots produces a
                    series of rugged and increasingly ugly protuberances at their base and along the
                    upper surface of the principal branches; while others declare that this mode of
                    training is the most perfect in theory’ that has been devised. We are inclined,
                    however, to prefer the old fan form, which when well executed is nearest the
                    natural habit of the tree, and best adapted to the uncertain climate of England;
                    moreover, in all cases, ultra refinement for the sake of appearance is neither
                    profitable nor judicious.</p>
                <p>For cold and late situations, the late Thomas Andrew Knight recommended the
                    encouragement of spurs on the young wood, as such spurs, when close to the wall,
                    generate the best organized and most vigorous blossoms, and generally insure a
                    crop of fruit. They may be produced, by taking care, during the summer pruning
                    or disbudding, to preserve a number of the little shoots emitted by the yearly
                    wood, only pinching off the minute succulent points. On the spurs thus formed
                    blossom buds will be developed early in the following season. This practice is
                    well adapted to cold situations.</p>

                <p>Peach trees require protection, especially at the period of blossoming,
                    particularly in the north of England and in Scotland. Canvas or bunting screens
                    are most effectual. By applying these early in the season, great benefit may be
                    derived from retarding the blossom till the frosty nights of spring have passed.
                    Wooden and glass copings are also very useful in warding off frosts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The pruning and training of the trees in the
                    peach house do not differ materially from the methods practised out of doors. It
                    may also be stated here that when occasion arises peach treeswell furnished with
                    buds may be transplanted and forced immediately without risking the crop of
                    fruit, a matter of some importance when, as sometimes happens, a tree may
                    accidentally fail. In the forcing of peaches fire heat is commonly applied about
                    December or January; but it may, where there is a demand, begin a month sooner.
                    At first the house should be merely kept closed at about 45°, but the heat
                    should gradually increase to 55° by the time the trees are in flower, and to 60°
                    when the fruit is set, after which the house should be kept moist by sprinkling
                    the walls and paths, or by placing water troughs on the return pipes, and the
                    temperature should range from 65° by day to 70° or more with sun heat. After the
                    fruit has set, the foliage should be refreshed and cleansed by the daily use of
                    the syringe or garden engine. When the fruit has stoned, that is, as soon as the
                    kernels have been formed, the temperature should be raised to about 60° as a
                    minimum, and to 70°, with 75° by sun heat, as a maximum. Water must now be
                    copiously supplied to the border, and air admitted in abundance. After the end
                    of April little fire heat is required. When the fruit begins to ripen, syringing
                    must be discontinued till the crop is gathered, after which the syringe must be
                    again occasionally used. If the leaves should happen to shade the fruit, not
                    only during the ripening process, but at any time after the stoning period, they
                    should be gently turned aside, for, in order that the fruit may acquire good
                    colour and flavour, it should be freely exposed to light and air when ripening;
                    it will bear the direct rays of the sun, even if they should rise to 100°. The
                    trees often suffer from mildew, which is best prevented by keeping the borders
                    of the peach house clear and sufficiently moist, and. the house well
                    ventilated.</p>

                <p>130. The <hi rend="italic">Pear</hi> has originated in part from the wild
                    species, Pyrus communis, and in part from other species of the genus, including
                    P. sinensis from China, P. Achras from Southern Russia, P. Sinai from Syria, and
                    P. salicifolia from the Caucasus. Itmay.be readily raised by sowing the pips of
                    ordinary cultivated or of wilding kinds, these forming what are known as free or
                    pear stocks, on which the choicer varieties are grafted for increase. For new
                    varieties the flowers should be fertilized with a view to combine, in the
                    seedlings which result from the union, the desirable qualities of the parents.
                    The dwarf and pyramid trees, more usually planted in gardens, are obtained by
                    grafting on the quince stock, the Portugal quince being the best; but this
                    stock, from its surface-rooting habit, is most suitable for thin shallow soils,
                    or for those of a cold damp nature. Some of the finer pears do not unite readily
                    with the quince, and in this case double working is resorted to; that is to say,
                    a vigorous-growing pear is first grafted on the quince, and then the choicer
                    pear is grafted on the pear introduced as its foster parent.</p>
                <p>In selecting young pear trees for walls or espaliers, some persons prefer plants
                    one year old from the graft, but trees two or three years trained are equally
                    good. The trees should be planted immediately before or after the fall of the
                    leaf. The wall trees require to be planted from 25 to 30 feet apart when on free
                    stocks, and from 15 to 20 feet when dwarfed. Where the trees are trained <hi
                    rend="italic">en pyramide,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">en quenouille</hi> (see
                    figs. 78, 79), they may stand 8 or 10 feet apart, but standards in orchards
                    should be allowed at least 30 feet, and dwarf bush trees half that distance.</p>
                <p>In the formation of the trees the same plan may be adopted as has already been
                    described as suitable for the apple (par. 116). For the pear orchard a warm
                    situation is very desirable, with a soil deep, substantial, and thoroughly
                    drained. Any good free loam is suitable, but a calcareous loam is the best. The
                    late Mr Rivers recommends that pear trees worked on the quince should have the
                    stock covered up to its junction with the graft. This is effected by raising up
                    a small mound of rich compost around it, a contrivance which induces the graft
                    to emit roots into the surface soil, and also keeps the stock from becoming hard
                    or bark-bound. The fruit of the pear is produced on spurs, which appear on
                    shoots more than one year old. The mode most commonly adopted of training wall
                    pear-trees is the horizontal (see figs, 80, 81). For the slender twiggy sorts
                    the fan form is to be preferred, while for strong growers like Gansel’s
                    Bergamot, the half-fan or the horizontal is more suitable. In the latter form
                    old trees are apt to acquire an undue projection from the wall, and become
                    scraggy, to avoid which a portion of the old spurs should be cut out
                    annually.</p>
                <p>The summer pruning of established wall or espalier-rail trees consists chiefly in
                    the timely displacing or rubbing off of the superfluous shoots, so that the
                    winter’ pruning, in horizontal training, is little more than adjusting the
                    leading shoots and thinning out the spurs, which should be kept close to the
                    wall, and allowed to retain but two or at most three buds. In fan-training, the
                    subordinate branches must be regulated, the spurs thinned out, and the young
                    laterals finally established in their places. When horizontal trees have fallen
                    into disorder, the branches may be cut back to within 9 inches of the vertical
                    stem and branch, and. trained in afresh, or they may be grafted with other
                    sorts, if a variety of kinds is wanted.</p>
                <p>Summer and autumn pears should be gathered before they are fully ripe, otherwise
                    they will not in general keep more than a few days. The Jargonelle, as Forsyth
                    rightly advises, should be allowed to remain on the tree, and be pulled daily as
                    wanted, the fruit from standard trees thus succeeding the produce of the wall
                    trees. In reference to the Crassane, Mr G. Lindley recommends gathering the crop
                    at three different times, the first a fortnight or more before it is ripe, the
                    second a week or ten days after that, and the third when fully ripe. The first
                    gathering will come into eating latest, and thus the season of the fruit may be
                    considerably prolonged. It is evident that the same method may be followed with
                    other sorts which continue only a short time in a mature state.</p>
                <p>The varieties of pears are very numerous, while comparatively few sorts are
                    required in any ordinary garden. The following is a small selection of good
                    sorts which do well in the climate of Britain, and they are arranged according
                    to the months when they are commonly in use,—a period which, however, varies
                    considerably in different seasons:—</p>

                <p>131. The <hi rend="italic">Pine-apple,</hi> Bromelia Ananas, or Ananassa sativa,
                    requires for its cultivation a tropical climate similar to that of the West
                    Indies—a mean temperature of 70° at the coldest and of 83° at the warmest
                    season, with a range of about 10° between the night and day temperature. It also
                    requires a supply of heat, averaging about 90°, to the soil in which the roots
                    are placed, and hence it is grown in a hot-house, where it can be supplied with
                    bottom heat, by being plunged in a bed of fermenting material, such as tanner’s
                    bark or decaying leaves, or by hot water applied either in pipes passing through
                    hollow chambers, or shallow hot-water tanks placed beneath the plunging beds.
                    The heat arising from violent fermentation is, however, greater than the tender
                    roots can bear, and if great watchfulness be not employed, the labour of many
                    months may be wasted in a single day. Bottom heat should not exceed 95°, and maV
                    be brought down when active growth is not required to about 75 .</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n286/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0286-0275"/>
                <p>It must be regulated in its application by the amount of light and of warmth in
                    the air. During the season when the plants are at rest it should be
                    comparatively low; during their season of active growth it should be
                    considerable; and during their ripening season it should be highest of all.</p>
                <p>The top spit of an old loamy pasture, including the turf, and mixed with about
                    one-third the bulk of good well-rotted dung, forms a suitable compost for the
                    pine-apple. The soil used at Meudon, where these fruits have been very
                    successfully grown, is a sandy peat or leaf-mould obtained from a high-lying
                    spot, where hard-wooded trees, chiefly beech, have long been growing. The late
                    Mr Fleming, when at Trentham, used a mixture of three parts turfy maiden loam to
                    one part of peat, these ingredients being mixed together and laid under a wooden
                    platform on which sheep were fed (which was so constructed that the dung and
                    urine of the sheep fell through), and left there long enough to become well
                    enriched. Other noted cultivators have recommended turfy loam and sheep or deer
                    dung in the proportion of six of loam to three of the manure, one of leaf-mould
                    being added. The compost should be prepared a considerable time beforehand, and
                    frequently turned over and aerated; when used, it should be roughly broken with
                    the spade, but not screened. Some cultivators, who do not otherwise enrich the
                    soil, use half-inch bones and soot at the time of potting in the proportion of
                    an 8-inch potful of each to a barrowful of fibrous surface soil. The plants when
                    growing freely are benefited by the use of liquid manure of an ammoniacal
                    character.</p>
                <p>The pine-apple is sometimes propagated by planting the crowns which grow on the
                    fruit, but more commonly from the suckers which appear at the base of the stem,
                    these being a less time in arriving at a fruiting state. When removed from the
                    fruit or stem, the crowns or suckers are trimmed and laid aside till the scar
                    has dried, after which they are potted. This usually takes place during August
                    or September, as the offsets should be allowed to obtain considerable size
                    before they are removed, for the reason that large suckers grow with more vigour
                    and come sooner into fruit than those of smaller size. They should be placed in
                    6-inch or 8-inch pots, the soil being somewhat lighter then than that used
                    afterwards. They may be slightly shaded for a short period, and in about eight
                    or twelve days may receive a little water. The old routine of pine-apple culture
                    embraced a period of three years, but this has been reduced by modern growers to
                    about eighteen months. The more rapid method was first brought into notice by
                    Abercrombie. Its chief features are the employment of more mature suckers at the
                    outset, and the acceleration of the growth of the plants afterwards by the
                    application of a hotter and moister atmosphere than formerly, so as to obtain
                    the growth of two summers in one.</p>
                <p>The roots should be preserved in a fresh healthy state during winter, so as not
                    to require being cut away, as was formerly done; and this may be secured by
                    giving very moderate and judicious waterings, and by keeping the bottom heat
                    well under control. About the beginning of March, or earlier, the forwardest
                    young plants from suckers are selected from the stock of succession plants, and
                    the earth and roots examined; they are then put into larger pots in good soil,
                    and plunged in a bed having a genial bottom heat of about 85°. They require to
                    be shaded for a few days, and after they begin to root should receive moderate
                    waterings. As soon as the roots thicken in the balls of soil, which will be
                    about the beginning of August, they are tobe transferred into 10-inch or 12 inch
                    pots, in which they will mature their fruit. At each successi ve shift the ball
                    of earth and roots is to be preserved entire. From March onwards the temperature
                    is gradually increased as follows:—In March, 60° to 70° by night, 70° to 80° by
                    day; April 70° to 75° by night, 80° to 85° by day; May 75° to 80° by night, 90°
                    to 95° by day; June 80° to 85* by night, 95° to 100° by day. After the beginning
                    of August the heat is allowed to decline gradually until it arrives at the
                    winter temperature of 60°. While fire heat is used, the nocturnal temperature
                    should not exceed 80°, and sufficient moisture must be supplied. To prevent the
                    plants from being drawn, they should be allowed ample space—2 feet from plant to
                    plant is not too much—and be placed as near the glass as possible. In August and
                    September abundance of air and more copious supplies of water are given. To
                    prevent the roots from damping off in winter, water must be cautiously applied,
                    and the pits should be heated by means of fire heat rather than by fermenting
                    materials. Some gardeners apply this biennial mode of cultivation only to the
                    varieties of the Queen type, but our best cultivators for the most part adopt it
                    in its main features for all varieties, and the fruit produced is finer than
                    that grown upon the triennial course. Those, however, who wish to cultivate such
                    large and coarse sorts as the Providence may possibly find it necessary to take
                    a longer period for fruiting them.</p>
                <p>The period at which pine-apple plants first show their fruit stems is the most
                    critical in their whole culture. The plant must be of a certain age, or at least
                    of a certain magnitude, before it will start freely or to good purpose. In the
                    second year a Queen pine is capable of producing a perfect fruit; and in the
                    third year the large Varieties arrive at puberty. The solid part of the stem is
                    then observed to have increased in bulk, and to have ascended considerably above
                    the soil. The start is generally required to be made at a particular period, but
                    the fruit stalks do not appear until the pot is filled with roots. It is
                    therefore necessary that the roots shall have nearly occupied all the new soil
                    by the time the development of the fruit is required, and care should be taken
                    that-in winter the tender fibres should suffer neither from drought nor from
                    excessive moisture or heat. After the plants show fruit they are never shifted;
                    but the surface soil may be replaced by some fresh and rich compost. Water is
                    supplied from time to time, but should never be colder than the average
                    temperature of the house. Whilst the fruit is swelling, care must be taken to
                    cany on the growth of the plant with equability and moderation. As the fruit
                    approaches maturity, water is gradually withheld, lest the flavour should be iιn
                    paired. Pine-apples should be cut a short time before they obtain complete
                    maturity; they do not keep sound long after being cut, and consequently, if they
                    have to be kept over for a short period the plant, pot and all, should be moved
                    to a dryish moderately cool room.</p>
                <p>The Hamiltonian system of pine growing was at one time more frequently adopted
                    than now. Instead of the suckers being detached from their parent stems before
                    fruiting, the base of the old stem was bared of leaves and earthed up with rich
                    compost, into which it rooted freely, each sucker thus producing a ripe fruit in
                    from eight to twelve months from the time it was started. When this fruit was
                    cut, the process was repeated till a third succession of fruit and a fourth were
                    obtained, after which the sucker which bore the last fruit was cut off with 6 or
                    8 inches of the main stem, and potted so as to furnish another similar progeny
                    of suckers.</p>
                <p>The Queen, as a quick-fruiting sort, and the larger Smooth-leaved Cayenne, are
                    the chief favourites among cultivators. It may, however, be useful to give the
                    names of a few of the best varieties :—</p>

                <p>132. The <hi rend="italic">Plum,</hi> Prunus domestica, is considered a native of
                    England, but many of the best cultivated varieties have been introduced from
                    France. The fruit is not only prized for dessert, but also for culinary
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>Plums are propagated chiefly by budding on stocks of the Mussel, Brussels, St
                    Julien, and Pear plums. The damson, wine sour, and other varieties, planted as
                    standards, are generally increased Ly suckers. For planting against walls, trees
                    which have been trained for two years in the nursery are preferred by some, but
                    maiden trees can be very successfully introduced, and by a course of liberal
                    treatment, with less hard pruning, may be more speedily got to a fruiting state.
                    Any good well-drained loamy soil is suitable for plums, that of medium quality
                    as to lightness being decidedly preferable. Walls with an east or west aspect
                    are generally allowed to them, the distance between the trees being from 20 to
                    30 feet. The horizontal mode of training is adopted by many, but the fan or
                    half-fan forms are also very commonly followed, and where there is sufficient
                    height probably the fan system is the best. The shoots ought to be laid in
                    nearly or quite at full length. The fruit is produced on small spurs on branches
                    at least two years old, and the same spurs continue fruitful for several years.
                    Standard plum trees should be planted 25 feet apart each way, and dwarfs 15 or
                    20 feet. Such trees require only to have a portion of their wood thinned out
                    occasionally when they are young. The hardy kinds grown in this way are very
                    productive.</p>
                <p>In favourable seasons the crops require thinning, to relieve the branches from
                    the excessive weight. The unripe fruit, if fully grown and beginning to change
                    colour, is quite fit for cooking. For dessert purposes the fruit should be
                    allowed to remain on the tree as long as it will hang, and should be gathered by
                    the stalk without disturbing the bloom. Such kinds as Coe’s Golden Drop and
                    Ickworth Impératrice, if gathered dry, wrapped in tissue paper, and laid in a
                    dry cool fruit-room, may be kept for months fit for use.</p>

                <p>133. The <hi rend="italic">Quince,</hi> Cydonia vulgaris, is but little
                    cultivated in Great Britain, two or three trees planted in the slip or orchard
                    being in general found to be sufficient for a supply of the fruit; in Scotland
                    it seldom approaches maturity, unless favoured by a wall. The fruit has a
                    powerful odour, but in the raw state is austere and astringent; it, however,
                    makes an agreeable marmalade, and is often used to give flavour and poignancy to
                    stewed or baked apples.</p>
                <p>The quince prefers a rich light and somewhat moist soil. The tree is generally
                    propagated by cuttings or layers, the former making the best plants, but being
                    longer in growing. It is much used as a dwarfing stock for certain kinds of
                    pears, and for this purpose the young plants when bedded out in the quarters
                    should be shortened back to about 18 or 20 inches. Those required to form
                    standard fruit-bearing trees should be trained up to a single stem till a height
                    of 5 or 6 feet is attained.</p>
                <p>There are three principal varieties of the quince, the Portugal, the
                    apple-shaped, and the pear-shaped. The Portugal is a taller and more vigorous
                    grower than the others, and has larger and finer fruit; the apple-shaped, which
                    has roundish fruit, is more productive, and ripens under less favourable
                    conditions than either of the others; while the pear-shaped has
                    roundish-pyriform fruit, which ripens later than that of the apple-shaped
                    variety.</p>
                <p>134. The <hi rend="italic">Raspberry,</hi> Rubus Idaeus, which is found wild in
                    Great Britain and in woods throughout Europe and Asiatic Russia, is propagated
                    from suckers, which may be taken off the parent stools in October, and planted
                    in rows 5 or 6 feet apart, and at 3 feet asunder in the rows. It is the habit of
                    the plant to throw up from the root every year a number of shoots or canes,
                    which bear fruit the subsequent year, and then decay. In dressing the plants,
                    which is done immediately after the crop is gathered, all these exhausted stems
                    are cut away, and of the young canes only three or four of the strongest are
                    left, which are shortened about a third. The stems, being too weak to stand by
                    themselves, are sometimes connected together by the points in the form of
                    arches, or a stake is driven in midway between the plants, and half the canes
                    are bent one way and half the other both being tied to the stake. Sometimes they
                    are tied upright to stakes fixed to each stool. The best support is, however,
                    obtained by fastening the points of the shoots to a slight horizontal rail or
                    bar, placed a foot and a half on the south side of the rows, by which means the
                    bearing shoots are deflected from the perpendicular to the sunny side of the
                    row, and are not shaded by the annual wood. When this mode of training is
                    adopted, the plan of planting 1 foot apart in the row and leaving one or two
                    canes only to each shoot is preferable. The ground between the rows should never
                    be disturbed by digging; but an abundant supply of good manure should be given
                    annually in autumn as a dressing, which should be forked in regularly to a depth
                    of 4 or 5 inches. All surplus suckers should be got away early in the summer
                    before they have robbed the roots, —five or six, to be reduced to the four best,
                    being reserved to each root. Fresh plantations of raspberries should be made
                    every six or seven years. The double-bearing varieties, which continue to fruit
                    during autumn, require light soils and warm situations. These should be cut
                    close down in February, as it is the strong young shoots of the current year
                    which bear the late autumnal crops. The other varieties may be made to bear in
                    autumn by cutting the stems half-way down at an early period in spring; but, as
                    with all other fruits, the flavour of the raspberry is best when it is allowed
                    to ripen at its natural season.</p>

                <p>135. The <hi rend="italic">Service,</hi> Pyrus Sorbus or P. domestica, is a
                    European tree which has been regarded as a native of England on the evidence of
                    a single tree, which has probably been planted, now existing in the forest of
                    Wyre. Though not much cultivated, its fruit is esteemed by some persons, and
                    therefore two or three trees may very well be provided with a place in the
                    orchard, or in a sheltered corner of the lawn. The tree is seldom productive
                    till it has arrived at a goodly size and age. The fruit has a peculiar acid
                    flavour, and, like the medlar, is fit for use only when thoroughly mellowed by
                    being kept till it has become bletted. There is a pear-shaped variety,
                    pyriformis, and also an apple-shaped variety, maliformis, both of which may be
                    propagated by layers, and still better by grafting on seedling plants of their
                    own kind. The fruit is sometimes brought to market in winter.</p>
                <p>136. The <hi rend="italic">Strawberry</hi> of the garden has been obtained by the
                    crossing of several species of Fragaria, the larger-fruited sorts from F.
                    grandiflora, chilensis, and virginiana, and the smaller alpines from F. vesca.
                    The alpine varieties should be raised from seeds; while the other sorts are
                    continued true to their kinds by runners.. If new varieties are desired, these
                    are obtained by judicious crossing, and seeding.</p>
                <p>The seeds of the alpines should be saved from the finest fruit ripened early in
                    the summer. They should at once be sown, either in a sheltered border outdoors
                    or in pots. The soil should be rich and light, and the seeds very slightly
                    covered by sifting over them some leaf-mould or old decomposed cow dung. When
                    the plants· appear and have made five or six leaves, they should be transplanted
                    to where they are to remain for bearing. The seeds sown in pots may be helped on
                    by gentle heat, and when the plants are large enough, should be pricked out in
                    fine rich soil, and in June transferred tα the open ground for bearing; they
                    will produce a partial crop in the autumn, and a full one in the following
                    season. The same treats ment may be applied to the choicer seedlings of the
                    larger-fruited sorts from which new varieties are expected.</p>
                <p>The runners of established sorts should be allowed to root in the soil adjoining
                    the plants, which should, therefore, be kept light and fine, and as soon as a
                    few leaves are produced on each the secondary runners should be stopped. When
                    the plants have become well-rooted, they should at once be planted out. They do
                    best in a. rather strong loam, and should be kept tolerably moist. The scarlet
                    section prefers a rich sandy loam. The ground should be trenched 2 or 3 feet
                    deep, and supplied with plenty of manure, a good proportion of which should lie
                    just below the roots, 10 or 12 inches from the surface. The plants may be put in
                    on an average about 2 feet apart. Mr Myatt, a well-known strawberry-grower for
                    market, plants in rows 18 inches apart, and the same distance from plant to
                    plant in the rows, but leaves a space of 30 inches for an alley separating
                    groups of three rows, and after the first year the middle row is cleared away.
                    Some of the best growers allow 2⅛ feet between the rows, with the plants 2 feet
                    from each other.</p>
                <p>A mulching of strawy manure put between the rows in spring serves to keep the
                    ground moist and the fruit clean, as well as to· afford nourishment to the
                    plants. Unless required, the runners are cut off early, in order to promote the
                    swelling of the fruit. The plants should be watered during dry weather after the
                    fruit is set, and occasionally till it begins to colour. As soon as the fruit
                    season is over, the runners are again removed, and the ground hoed and raked.
                    The plantation should be renewed every second or third year, or less frequently
                    if kept free of runners, if the old leaves are cut away after the fruit has been
                    gathered, and if a good top-dressing of rotten dung or leaf-mould is applied. A
                    top-dressing of loam is beneficial if applied before the plants begin to grow in
                    spring, but after that period they should not be disturbed during the summer
                    either at root or at top. If the plants produce a large number of flower-scapes,
                    each should, if fine large fruit is desired, have them reduced to about four of
                    the strongest. The lowest blossoms on the scape will be found to produce the
                    largest, earliest, and best fruits. The fruit should not be gathered till it is
                    quite ripe, and then, if possible, it should be quite dry, but not heated by the
                    sun. Those intended for preserving are best taken without the stalk and the
                    calyx.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The runners propagated for forcing are layered
                    into 3-inch pots, filled with rich soil, and held firm by a peg or stone. If
                    kept duly watered, they will soon form independent plants. The earlier they are
                    secured the better. When firmly rooted they are removed and transferred into
                    well-drained 6-inch pots, of strong well-enriched loam, the soil being rammed
                    very firmly into the pots, which are to be set in an open airy place. In severe
                    frosts they should be covered with dry litter or bracken, but do not necessarily
                    require to be placed under glass. They are moved into the forcing houses as
                    required. The main points to be kept in view in forcing strawberries are, first,
                    to have strong stocky plants, the leaves of which have grown sturdily from being
                    well exposed to light, and secondly, to grow them on slowly till fruit is set.
                    When they are first introduced into heat, the temperature should not exceed 45°
                    or 50° by fire heat, and air must be freely admitted; should the leaves appear
                    to grow up thin and delicate, less fire heat and more air must be given, but an
                    average temperature of 55° by day may be allowed, and continued while the plants
                    are in flower. When the fruit is set the heat may be gradually increased, till
                    at the ripening period it stands at 65°, and occasionally at 75° by sunheat.
                    While the fruit is swelling the plants should never be allowed to get dry, but
                    when it begins, to colour no more water should be given than is absolutely
                    requisite to keep the leaves from flagging. The plants should be removed from
                    the house as soon as the crop is gathered. The forced plants properly hardened
                    make <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"

                    early in summer, in good ground, will often produce a useful autumnal crop.</p>
                <p>The varieties are very numerous. The following are some of the bestand most
                    distinct of those now in cultivation, those marked* being specially suitable for
                    forcing:—</p>
                <p>Amateur—a brisk-flavoured variety.</p>
                <p>British Queen*—one of the best-flavoured sorts; requires good cultivation.</p>
                <p>Dr Hogg—a hardier form of British Queen.</p>
                <p>Elton—late, and valuable for preserving.</p>
                <p>Enchantress—a fine-flavoured late variety.</p>
                <p>filbert Pine *—an excellent high-flavoured sort.</p>

                <p>Vicomtesse Héricart de Thury*-good for all purposes; one of the best.</p>
                <p>137. The <hi rend="italic">Vine,</hi> Vitis vinifera, a native of the shores of
                    the Caspian, and a deciduous climbing shrub, is hardy in Britain so far as
                    regards its vegetation, but not hardy enough to bring its fruit to satisfactory
                    maturity, so that for all practical purposes the vine must be regarded as a
                    tender fruit. Planted against a wall or a building having a south aspect, or
                    trained over a sunny roof, such sorts as the Black Cluster, Black Prince,
                    Pitmaston White Cluster, Royal Muscadine, Sweetwater, &amp;c., will ripen in the
                    warmest English summers so as to be very pleasant eating, but in cold summers
                    the fruit is not eatable in the raw state, and can only be converted into wine
                    or vinegar. For outdoor culture the long-rod system is generally preferred.</p>
                <p>When the plant is grown under glass, the vine border should occupy the interior
                    of the house and extend outwards in the front, but it is best made by
                    instalments of 5 or 6 feet as fast as the previous portions become λvell filled
                    with roots, which may readily be done by packing up a turf wall at the extremity
                    of the portion to be newly made; an exterior width of 15 feet will be
                    sufficient. Inside borders require frequent and thorough waterings. In
                    well-drained localities the border may be partially below the ground level, but
                    in damp situations it should be made on the surface; in either case the firm
                    solid bottom should slope outwards toward an efficient drain. A good bottom may
                    be formed by chalk rammed down close. On this should be laid at least a foot
                    thick of coarse hard rubbly material, a layer of rough turf, grass side
                    downwards, being spread over it to prevent the compost from working down. The
                    soil itself, which should be 2⅛ or 3 feet deep, never less than 2 feet, should
                    consist of live parts rich turfy loam, one part old lime rubbish or broken
                    bricks, including a little wood ashes or burnt earth (ballast), one part broken
                    charcoal, and about one part of half-inch bones, the whole being thoroughly
                    mixed, and kept dryish till used.</p>
                <p>Young vines raised from eyes are gen erally preferred for planting. The eyes
                    being selected from well-ripened shoots of the previous year are planted about
                    the end of January, singly, in small pots of light loamy compost, and after
                    standing in a warm place for a few days should be plunged in a propagating bed,
                    having a bottom heat of 75°, which should be increased to 85° when they have
                    produced several leaves, the atmosphere being kept at about the same temperature
                    or higher by sun heat during the day, and at about 75° at night. As soon as
                    roots are freely formed the plants must be shifted into 6-inch pots, and later
                    on into 12-inch ones. The shoots are trained up near the glass, and, with plenty
                    of heat (top and bottom) and of water, with air and light, and manure water
                    occasionally, will form firm strong well-ripened canes in the course of the
                    season. To prepare the vine for planting, it should be cut back to within 2 feet
                    of the pot early in the season, and only 3 or 4 of the eyes at the base should
                    be allowed to grow on. The best time for planting is in spring, when the young
                    shoots have just started. The vines should be planted inside the house, from 1
                    to 2 feet from the front wall, the roots being placed an inch deeper in the soil
                    than before, carefully disentangled and spread outwards from the stem, and
                    covered carefully and firmly with friable loam, without manure. When the shoots
                    are fairly developed, the two strongest are to be selected and trained in. When
                    forcing is commenced, the vinery is shut up for two or three weeks without fire
                    heat, the mean temperature ranging about 50°. Fire heat must be at first applied
                    very gently, and may range about 55° at night, and from 65 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> to 70° by day, but a few degrees more may be given
                    them as the buds break and the new shoots appear. When they are in flower, and
                    onwards during the swelling of the berries, 85° may be taken as a maximum,
                    running up to 90° with sun heat, and the temperature may be lowered somewhat
                    when the fruit is ripe. As much ventilation as the state of the weather will
                    permit should be given. A moist growing atmosphere is necessary both for the
                    swelling fruit and for maintaining the health of the foliage. A due amount of
                    moisture may be kept up by the use of evaporating troughs and by syringing the
                    walls and pathways two or three times a day, but the leaves should not be
                    syringed. When the vines are in flower, and when the fruit is colouring, the
                    evaporating troughs should be kept dry, but the aridity must not be excessive,
                    lest the red spider and other hurtful insects should attack the leaves. In the
                    course of the season the borders (inside) will require several thorough soakings
                    of warm water,—the first when the house is shut up, this being repeated when the
                    vines have made young shoots a few inches long, again when the vines are in
                    flower, and still again when the berries are taking the second swelling after
                    stoning. Outside borders require watering in very dry summer weather only.</p>
                <p>There are three principal systems of pruning vines, termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >long-rod,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">short-rod,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spur</hi> systems, and good crops have been obtained by each of them. It is
                    admitted that larger bunches are generally obtained by the long-rod than by the
                    spur system. The principle of this mode of pruning is to train in at
                    considerable length, according to their strength, shoots of the last year’s
                    growth for producing shoots to bear fruit in the present; these rods are
                    afterwards cut away and replaced by young shoots trained up during the preceding
                    summer; and these are in their turn cut out in the following autumn after
                    bearing, and replaced by shoots of that summer’s growth. By the short-rod
                    system, short instead of long rods are retained; they are dealt with in a
                    similar manner. The spur system has, however, become the most general. In this
                    case the vines are usually planted so that one can be trained up under each
                    rafter, or up the middle of the sash, the latter method being preferable. The
                    shoots are cut back to buds close to the stem, which should be encouraged to
                    form alternately at equal distances right and left, by removing those buds from
                    the original shoot which are not conveniently placed. The young shoots from
                    these buds are to be gently brought to a horizontal position, by bending them a
                    little at a time, and usually opposite about the fourth leaf the rudiments of a
                    bunch will be developed. The leaf directly opposite the bunch must in all cases
                    be preserved, and the young shoot is to be topped at one or two joints beyond
                    tbe incipient fruit, the latter distance being preferable if there is plenty of
                    room for the foliage to expand; the lateral shoots, which will push out after
                    the topping, must be again topped above their first or second joints. If the
                    bunches are too numerous they must be thinned before the flowers expand, and the
                    berries also must be properly thinned out and regulated as soon as they are well
                    set, care being taken, in avoiding overcrowding, that the bunches be not made
                    too thin and loose.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of vines in pots is very commonly practised with good results,
                    and pot-vines are very useful to force for the earliest crop. The plants should
                    be raised from eyes, and grown as strong as possible in the way already noted,
                    in rich turfy loam mixed with about one-third of horse dung and a little bone
                    dust. The temperature should be gradually increased from 60° to 80°, or 90° by
                    sun heat, and a bottom heat a few degrees higher must be maintained during their
                    growth. As the roots require more room, the plants should be shifted from 3-inch
                    pots into those of 6, 12, or 15 inches in diameter, in any of which larger sizes
                    they may be fruited in the following season, but, to be successful in this, the
                    young rod produced must be thoroughly matured after it lias reached its limit of
                    growth.</p>
                <p>The vine, both indoors and out, is very subject to the vine-mildew, which appears
                    to the naked eye like a white powder; when this is visible there is no effectual
                    remedy, but if taken at the earliest stage it may be destroyed by dusting the
                    whole plant, stem, leaves, and fruit, with sulphur. An equally destructive enemy
                    is the vine louse, <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vastatrix.</hi> No certain easily applied cure has yet been discovered, and
                    practically the only sure remedy is to destroy the vines, clear out the old
                    infested soil, and cleanse the structures thoroughly in every part.</p>
                <p>The number of varieties of grapes possessing some merit is considerable, but a
                    very few of them will be found sufficient to supply all the wants of the
                    cultivator. For general purposes nothing approaches the Black Hamburg (including

                <p>138. The <hi rend="italic">Walnut,</hi> Juglans regia, is a lofty tree, native of
                    Persia and Asia Minor. The fruit, whilst young and tender, is much used for
                    pickling, and when ripe is a favourite article of the dessert. The tree succeeds
                    in deep sandy or calcareous loams, and in stiff loams resting on a gravelly
                    bottom. It requires free exposure to air and light. It is propagated by seeds,
                    and occasionally by budding, grafting, or inarching for the perpetuation of
                    special varieties. The trees form their heads naturally, and therefore little
                    pruning is required, it being merely necessary to cut off straggling growths,
                    and to prevent the branches from interlacing. The best time for performing this
                    is in the autumn, just after the fall of the leaf. Plants raised from the seed
                    seldom become productive till they are twenty years old. The fruit is produced
                    at the extremities of the shoots of the preceding y ar; and therefore, in
                    gathering the crop, care should be taken not to injure the young wood. In some
                    parts of England the trees are thrashed with rods or poles to obtain the nuts,
                    but this is far from being a commendable mode of collecting them.</p>
                <p>Besides the commo.ι walnut, there are several varieties cultivated, particularly
                    the Thin-shelled and the Thetford or Highflyer, which last is by far the best
                    walnut grown.</p>
                <p>139. <hi rend="italic">Orchard-house Trees.—</hi> The fruits that may be
                    successfully grown in unheated orchard-houses are peaches, nectarines, apricots,
                    plums, figs, cherries, pears, and apples; and all, except the last two, are more
                    readily obtained in those which are judiciously heated.</p>
                <p>The trees are sometimes planted out, and sometimes grown in pots. The potted
                    trees are decidedly to be preferred, for those which are planted out are less at
                    the command of the cultivator, and unless the houses are large are apt to
                    outgrow the space; they do not indeed require so much attention as regards
                    water, while pot trees entail very much labour in this respect from the time the
                    fruit is fairly set until it is near the ripening stage; but on the other hand a
                    much greater variety may be grown in this way, and the trees can be shifted from
                    place to place, as required, with the utmost facility. While at fest in winter
                    they can be set close together without injury, and may be continued in this way
                    until they come into flower. After the Getting of the fruit, the hardier sorts,
                    as plums, pears, and apples, can be taken out, and put under temporary awnings
                    till it is safe to plunge them beside the walks in the open quarters of the
                    garden, where they grow and swell, if duly watered, as well as if established in
                    the ground. In dry summer weather they need a good watering two or three times a
                    day, and besides this should have a dose of liquid manure occasionally. This
                    removal of the hardier plants to the open air leaves more space under glass for
                    the tenderer sorts.</p>
                <p>The trees are most convenient when trained in the pyramidal form, or as compact
                    bushes; and the summer treatment should consist in pinching back the points of
                    all the growing shoots after they have formed two or three leaves.</p>
                <p>The vigour of pot fruit trees is greatly due to judicious surfacedressing during
                    the summer months. It should be applied at intervals of ten or twelve days, and
                    should be made up of equal i&gt;aτts of horse-droppings, turfy loam, and malt
                    dust, the whole being aid up in a heap and frequently turned. The dressing
                    should not, however, be applied within three weeks of the ripening of the
                    fruit.</p>
                <p>The trees should be repotted in autumn as soon as the leaves have done their
                    work, in similar compost to that first employed—good turfy loam, with about a
                    sixth of rotted manure, and a sprinkling of bone dust. They are to be turned out
                    of the pot, and a slice of about an inch in thickness pared off with a sharp
                    knife, and are then to be replaced in a pot of the same size as that in which
                    they previously grew, unless in those cases where a larger one may be afforded,
                    and then the roots need not be cut away. This disrooting may sometimes be done
                    before the leaves are quite ready to fall, in which case care is necessary to
                    prevent the tree from flagging; and, if the weather be hot, the tops should be
                    kept moist by frequently dewing the foliage with the syringe, but no water must
                    be given at the root for a day or two after repotting. If the wood has been well
                    ripened, trees treated in this way will bear freely during the following season.
                    Whether placed on the floor of the house, or plunged outdoors, the pots should
                    stand on two bricks placed a little apart, so that worms cannot gain admittance
                    by the draining-hole.</p>
                <p>The fruit obtained from trees well cultivated in pots in an orchardhouse will
                    compare, as regards size and quality, with the best fruit ripened on an open
                    wall or in a forcing-house; but, when grown without fire heat, it is of course
                    but little in advance of the outdoor crops. To the amateur this mode of culture
                    will be found to present many attractions.</p>
                <p>VII. Vegetables.</p>
                <p>140. Under this head we include those esculents which are largely eaten as
                    “vegetables” or as “salads,” while the various “herbs” which are used chiefly
                    for flavouring or garnishing will be referred to in a supplementary
                    paragraph.</p>
                <p>141. The <hi rend="italic">Artichoke,</hi> Cynara Scolymus, is a stout-growing
                    hardy perennial, cultivated for the sake of the immature flower-heads. In France
                    the whole of the leaves of the involucre are eaten when in a young and tender
                    state, <hi rend="italic">en poivrade,</hi> or with pepper, salt, and vinegar;
                    but the only parts of the flower-head used in England are the base of the leaves
                    of the involucre, and the immature floral receptacle called the <hi
                    rend="italic">bottom,</hi> freed from the bristly seed -down which is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">choke.</hi> In old plantations about to be destroyed the
                    central leaves are sometimes blanched and eaten; this edible part, like that of
                    the nearly related cardoon (par. 150), is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chard.</hi></p>
                <p>The artichoke requires a deep cool dry soil, well enriched, and deeply trenched.
                    It is propagated by parting the roots in April, the sets being planted in rows 4
                    or 5 feet asunder, and 2 feet apart in the rows. As the young plants afford a
                    crop which succeeds that of old plants, a new plantation is made in some gardens
                    every year. During summer the 'artichokes require little other attention than to
                    be kept clear of weeds. In November the decayed stems and leaves are removed,
                    the ground cleared, and a cone of a foot deep of sifted coal-ashes, or rotten
                    tan, or littery dung, is placed close round the base to defend the stools from
                    frost. In April this is taken away, the stocks are examined, and two or three
                    only of the strongest shoots are permitted to remain; a dressing of manure is
                    given—well-rotted hotbed dung or seaweed—and the ground between the rows is
                    forked over. The offsets, carefully removed, afford materials <hi rend="italic"
                    >for</hi> young plantations. The heads are cut when nearly full grown, before
                    the scales of the involucre open out.</p>
                <p>The varieties most esteemed in England are the Green or French, which has conical
                    heads, and is considered the highest flavoured; the Globe, which has dull
                    purplish heads, and is well adapted for a general crop; and the Purple, which is
                    the earliest. The Laon is that most widely grown at Paris.</p>
                <p>142. The <hi rend="italic">Asparagus,</hi> Asparagus officinalis, is one of the
                    most delicate of our esculents, possessing well-marked diuretic properties, and
                    is grown extensively in private gardens as well as for market. The asparagus
                    prefers a loose light deep sandy soil; the depth should be 3 feet, the soil
                    being well trenched, and all surplus water got away. A considerable quantity of
                    well-rotted dung or of recent seaweed should be laid in the bottom of the
                    trench, and another top-dressing of manure should be dug in preparatory to
                    planting or sowing. Nitrate of soda appears to be the best artificial manure,
                    and salt applied at the rate of 2 lb to the square yard is a good dressing while
                    the plants are growing. The beds should be 3 feet or 5 feet wide,· with
                    intervening alleys of 2 feet, the narrower beds taking two rows of plants, the
                    wider ones three rows. The beds should run east and west, so that the sun’s rays
                    may strike against the side of the bed. In some cases the plants are grown in
                    equidistant rows 3 to 4 feet apart. Where the beds are made with plants already
                    prepared, either one-year old or two-year old plants may be used, for which a
                    trench should be cut sufficient to afford room for spreading out the roots, the
                    crowns being all kept at about 2 inches below the surface. Planting is best done
                    in May, after the plants have started into growth. To prevent injury to the
                    roots, it is, however, perhaps the better plan to sow the seeds in the beds
                    where the plants are to remain.</p>
                <p>The seed should be sown in March in slight drills; and it is a good precaution to
                    sow more than is necessary, and to thin out towards the end of the first summer,
                    to the distance of about 6 inches in the rows. The ground must be hoed and kept
                    clear of weeds. Frequently slight crops of lettuce are taken from the surface of
                    the beds, and of cauliflower from the spaces between them. The asparagus heads
                    should not be cut before the third spring, and are not in perfection till the
                    fourth or fifth.</p>
                <p>The manuring of asparagus, which can scarcely be overdone, should be performed in
                    the end of autumn, when the dead steins are removed. When the plants are in
                    beds, the surface should be stirred with a fork; a layer of well-rotted hotbed
                    dung should then be laid on, and ιhe whole covered with a sprinkling of earth
                    from the alleys. If the plants are grown in rows, the manure is simply dug in
                    between them by means of a digging fork, care being taken not to injure the
                    roots. These operations are repeated annually, and no other culture is required;
                    but it is necessary to observe a due <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0290-0279"/> moderation in reaping the crop, as the shoots,
                    when cut too freely, become gradually smaller. A considerable quantity of ground
                    is consequently required to keep up a supply. It is a general rule never to
                    gather asparagus after peas have come into season. To experience the finest
                    flavour of asparagus, it should be eaten immediately after having been gathered;
                    if kept longer than one day, or set into water, its finer flavour is altogether
                    lost. If properly treated, asparagus beds will continue to bear well for many
                    years.</p>
                <p>The asparagus grown at Argenteuil, near Paris, has acquired much notoriety for
                    its large size and excellent quality. The French growers plant in trenches,
                    instead of raised beds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The most common method of forcing asparagus is
                    to prepare, early in the year, a moderate hotbed of stable litter with a bottom
                    heat of 70°, and to cover it with a common frame. After the heat of fermentation
                    has somewhat subsided, the surface of the bed is covered with a layer of light
                    earth or exhausted tan-bark, and in this the roots of strong mature plants are
                    closely placed. The crowns of the roots are then covered with 3 to 6 inches of
                    soil. A common three-light frame may hold 500 or 600 plants, and will afford a
                    supply for several weeks. After planting, linings are applied when necessary to
                    keep up the heat, but care must be taken not to scorch the roots; air must be
                    occasionally admitted. Where there are pits heated by hot water or by the tank
                    system, they may be advantageously applied to this purpose. A succession of
                    crops must be maintained by annually sowing or planting new beds. Mr Lindegard,
                    of the Royal Gardens at Copenhagen, recommends the plan of forcing asparagus on
                    the ground on which it grows, but the results obtained in this way are not so
                    satisfactory.</p>
                <p>The principal varieties are the Red-topped and the Green-topped, of which there
                    are several reputed sub-varieties, as the Battersea, Gravesend, Giant, Colossal,
                    &lt;fcc., which differ but slightly from each other.</p>
                <p>143. The <hi rend="italic">Bean,</hi> Faba vulgaris, is an annual plant. The
                    seeds are sown about 4 inches apart, in drills 2⅛ feet asunder for the smaller
                    and 3 feet for the larger sorts. The soil should be a rather heavy loam, deeply
                    worked and well enriched. For an early crop Marshall’s Early Dwarf Prolific and
                    the Dwarf Crimson-seeded may be sown in November, and protected during winter in
                    the same manner as early peas. An early crop may also be obtained by dibbling in
                    the seeds in November, sheltering by a frame, and in February transplanting them
                    to, a warm border. Successional crops of Early Seville or Early Longpod should
                    be sown in January and February, and the Longpods or Green Windsor in March,
                    April, and May, for a general crop, while for later crops the Dutch Longpod may
                    be sown in June or early in July. All the culture necessary is that the earth be
                    drawn up about the stems. The plants are usually topped when the pods have set,
                    as this not only removes the black aphides which often settle there, but is also
                    found to promote the filling of the pods.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the best sorts :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Early.—</hi> Dwarf Crimson-seeded, Marshall’s Early Dwarf
                    Prolific, Early Seville, Early Longpod.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Late.—</hi> Windsor, Green Windsor, Dutch Longpod.</p>
                <p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bean,</hi> vol. iii. p. 460, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Agriculture,</hi> vol. i. p. 360.</p>
                <p>144. The <hi rend="italic">Beet,</hi> Beta vulgaris, is a hardy biennial, native
                    of the south of Europe, on the sea-coast. The boiled root is eaten cold, either
                    by itself or as a salad; it is also often used as a pickle. The beet prospers in
                    a rich deep soil, well pulverized by the spade. If manure is required, it should
                    be deposited at the bottom of the trench in preparing the ground. The seeds
                    should be sown in drills 15 inches asunder, in April or early in May, and the
                    plants are afterwards to be thinned to about 8 inches apart in the lines, but
                    not more, as moderate-sized roots are preferable. The plants should grow on till
                    the end of October or later, when a portion should be taken up for use, and the
                    rest laid in in a sheltered corner, and covered up from frost. The roots must
                    not be bruised, and the leaves must be twisted off—not closely cut, as they are
                    then liable to bleed. In the north the crop may be wholly taken up in autumn,
                    and stored in a pit or cellar, beyond reach of frost. If it is desired to have
                    fresh roots early, the seeds should be sown at the end of February or beginning
                    of March; and if a succession is required, a few more may be sown by the end of
                    March.</p>
                <p>The Yellow Beets are not appreciated at table, and the White Sugar Beets are not
                    suitable for garden culture. We shall only name a selection of the red-fleshed
                    sorts Turnip-rooted or Egyptian (very early), Red Castelnaudary (the type of our
                    best beets), Pine-apple Short-top, Nutting’s Selected, Carter’s Perfection of
                    Beets, Sutton’s Dark Red, Dell’s Crimson or Osborn’s Select.</p>
                <p>The White Beet, Beta Cicla, is cultivated for the leaves, which are used as
                    spinach; but for this they are a very sorry substitute. The midribs and stalks
                    of the leaves are also stewed and eaten as seakale, under the name of Swiss
                    chard. The culture does not differ materially from that of the red beet, but
                    more space is required.</p>
                <p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Beet,</hi> vol. iii. p. 504, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Agriculture,</hi> vol. i. p. 381.</p>
                <p>145. The <hi rend="italic">Borecole</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kale,</hi> Brassica
                    oleracea acephala, includes several varieties which are amongst the hardiest of
                    our esculents, and seldom fail to yield a good supply of winter greens. They
                    require well-enriched soil, and sufficient space for full exposure to air; and
                    they should also be sown early, so as to be well established and hardened before
                    winter.</p>
                <p>The main crops should be sown about the first week of April, or, in the north, in
                    the third week of March, and a succession a month later. The Buda kale is sown
                    in May, and planted out in September, but a sowing for late spring use may be
                    made in the last week of August, and transplanted towards the end of September.
                    To prevent overcrowding, the plants should be transplanted as soon as they are
                    of sufficient size, but if the ground is not ready to receive them a sufficient
                    number should be pricked out in some open spot. In general the more vigorous
                    sorts should be planted in rows 2⅜ feet or 3 feet and the smaller growers 2 feet
                    apart, and 18 inches from plant to plant. In these the heads should be first
                    used, only so much of the heart as is fresh and tender being cut out for
                    boiling; side shoots or sprouts are afterwards produced for a long time in
                    succession, and may be used so long as they are tender enough to admit of being
                    gathered by snapping their stalks asunder.</p>
                <p>The best of the borecoles or kales are—Dwarf Green Curled or Scotch Kale, very
                    hardy, and from its dwarf habit often sheltered by snow; Cottager’s Kale, very
                    hardy, one of the most prolific and well-flavoured; Purple Borecole, very hardy.
                    The following are less vigorous in growth, but are of excellent quality
                    Jerusalem Kale, Egyptian Kale, Buda Kale,—the last two very hardy.</p>
                <p>146. The <hi rend="italic">Broccoli,</hi> Brassica oleracea botrytis
                    asparagoides, is sup-I posed to have sprung from the cauliflower, being, like
                    it, of Italian origin, and differing chiefly in possessing greater hardiness of
                    constitution. Miller indeed states <hi rend="italic">{Gardeners'
                    Dictionary')</hi> that the broccolis known in his time were imported from the
                    island of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>The broccoli succeeds best in a fresh, loamy soil, somewhat firm in texture. For
                    the autumn broccolis the ground can scarcely be too rich, but the winter and
                    spring sorts, on ground of this character, are apt to become so succulent and
                    tender that the plants suffer from frost even in sheltered situations, while
                    plants less stimulated by manure and growing in the open field may be nearly all
                    saved, even in severe winters. The main crops of the early sorts, for use in
                    autumn, such as the Capes and Grange’s, should be sown early in May, and planted
                    out while young, to prevent them coming too early into flower; in the north they
                    may be sown a fortnight earlier. The later sorts, for use during winter and
                    spring, should be sown about the middle or end of May, or about ten days earlier
                    in the north. The seed beds should be made in fresh light unexhausted soil; and
                    if the season be dry, the ground should be well watered before sowing. If the
                    young plants are crowding each other, they should be thinned. The ground should
                    not be dug before planting them out, as the firmer it is the better; but a
                    shallow drill may be drawn to mark the lines. The larger growing sorts may be
                    put in rows 3 feet apart, and the plants about 2⅜ feet apart in the rows, and
                    the smaller-growing ones at from 2 to 2⅜ feet between, and 1⅜ to 2 feet in the
                    rows. If the ground is not prepared when young plants are ready for removal,
                    they should be transferred to nursery beds and planted at 3 to 4 inches apart,
                    but the earlier they can be got into their permanent places the better.</p>
                <p>It is of course the young flower-heads of the plant which are eaten. When these
                    form, they should be shielded from the light, by bending or breaking down an
                    inner leaf or two. In some of the sorts the leaves naturally curve over the
                    heads. To prevent injury to the heads by frost in severe winters, the plants
                    should be laid in with their heads sloping towards the north, the soil being
                    thrown back so as to cover their stems; or they may be taken up and laid in
                    closely in.deep trenches, so that none of the lower bare portion of the stem may
                    be exposed. Some dry fern may also be laid over the tops.</p>
                <p>The spring varieties are extremely valuable, as they come at a season when the
                    finer vegetables are scarce. They afford a supply from March to May inclusive.
                    In all cases great care should be taken to procure the seed true, as it is very
                    liable to become deteriorated through crossing by insect agency.</p>
                <p>The following are good types of broccoli, but the varieties are frequently
                    changing, in name at least, the supposed novelties being often merely good and
                    pure stocks of older kinds :—</p>

                <p>147. The <hi rend="italic">Brussels Sprouts,</hi> Brassica oleracea bullata
                    gemmifera, have long been cultivated near Brussels. There appears to be no
                    information as to the plant’s origin, but, according to the late Dr Van Mons, it
                    is mentioned in the year 1213, in the regulations for holding the markets of
                    Belgium, under the name of <hi rend="italic">spruyten</hi> (sprouts). It is very
                    hardy and productive, and is much esteemed for the table on account of its
                    flavour and its sightly appearance.</p>
                <p>The seed should be sown about the middle of March, and again in the first or
                    second week in April for succession. Any good garden soil is suitable. For an
                    early crop it may be sown in a warm pit in February, pricked out and hardened in
                    frames, and planted out in a warm situation in April. The main crop may be
                    planted in rows 2 feet asunder, the plants 18 inches apart. They should begot
                    out <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0291-0280"/> early, so as to be well established and come into
                    use before winter. The head may be cut and used after the best of the little
                    rosettes which feather the stem have been gathered; but, if cut too early, it
                    exposes these rosettes, which are the most delicate portion of the produce, to
                    injury, if the weather be severe.</p>
                <p>The earliest sprouts become fit for use in November, and they continue good, or
                    even improve in quality, till the month of March following. Van Mons mentions
                    that by successive sowings the sprouts are obtained in Brussels for the greater
                    part of the year.</p>
                <p>The most reliable crop is perhaps obtained from seed of the ordinary variety
                    imported from Holland; but good English-raised seed, represented by Carter’s
                    Perfection, may also be obtained. Scrymger’s Giant is a vigorous dwarf kind. We
                    doubt, however, the policy of planting dwarf kinds, as the taller ones with
                    longer stems, if sufficiently vigorous, must yield a larger produce.</p>
                <p>In this place may be noted two hybrid sprouts, both raised by Mr Melville, at
                    Dalmeny Park, near Edinburgh. They are the Albert Sprouts, a hardy green, long
                    in running to seed, the result of a cross between the savoy and Brussels
                    sprouts; and the Dalmeny Sprouts, which grow 6 inches or 8 inches high, with a
                    compactly cabbaged head of moderate size, and a stem thickly set with
                    cabbagelike sprouts, a cross obtained between the cabbage and Brussels sprouts.
                    Both may be grown in the same way as the borecoles.</p>
                <p>148. The <hi rend="italic">Cabbage,</hi> Brassica oleracea capitata, has sprung
                    from the biennial B. oleracea of the British sea-coasts. The cabbage requires a
                    well-manured and well-wrought loamy soil. It should have abundant water in
                    summer, liquid manure being specially beneficial. Round London, where it is
                    grown in perfection, the ground for it is dug to the depth of two spades or
                    spits, the lower portion being brought up to the action of the weather, and
                    rendered available as food for the plants; while, the top-soil, containing the
                    eggs and larvae of many insects, being deeply buried, the plants are less liable
                    to be attacked by the club. Farm-yard manure is that most suitable for the
                    cabbage, but artificial manures such as guano, superphosphate of lime or gypsum,
                    together with lime-rubbish, wood-ashes, and marl, may, if required, be applied
                    with advantage.</p>
                <p>The first sowing of cabbage should be made about the beginning of March, and
                    should consist of Nonpareil or Enfield Market (also known as the Early
                    Battersea); these will be ready for use in July and August, following the
                    autumn-sown crops. Another sowing of the same sorts, or of the St John’s Day,
                    should be made in the last week of March or first week of April, and will afford
                    a supply from August till November; and a further crop of such sorts as Early
                    York, Little Pixie, Atkins’s Matchless, or other kinds that heart quickly, may
                    be made in May to supply young-hearted cabbages in the early part of winter. The
                    autumn sowing, which is the most important, and affords the supply for spring
                    and early summer use, should be made about the last week in August, in warm
                    localities in the south, and about a fortnight earlier in the north; or, to meet
                    fluctuations of climate, it is as well in both cases to anticipate this sowing
                    by another two or three weeks earlier, planting out a portion from each, but the
                    larger number from that sowing which promises best to stand without running to
                    seed. The sorts should be Enfield Market, Nonpareil, or Winnigstadt. These later
                    sown plants will be ready for transplanting by the end of September or early in
                    October, and may be placed in the ground previously occupied by the pea or bean
                    crop.</p>
                <p>The cabbages grown late in autumn and in the beginning of winter are denominated
                    Coleworts (vulg. Collards), from a kindred vegetable no longer cultivated. Two
                    sowings are made, in the middle of June and in July, and the seedlings are
                    planted a foot or 15 inches asunder, the rows being 8 or 10 inches apart. The
                    sorts employed are the Rosette and the Hardy Green.</p>
                <p>About London the large sorts, as Enfield Market, are planted for spring cabbages
                    2 feet apart each way; but a plant from an earlier sowing is dibbled in between
                    every two in the rows, and an intermediate row a foot apart is put in between
                    the permanent rows, these extra plants being drawn as coleworts in the course of
                    the winter. The smaller sorts of cabbage may be planted 12 inches apart, with 12
                    or 15 inches between the rows. The large sorts should be planted 2 feet apart,
                    with 2⅜ feet between the rows. The only culture required is to stir the surface
                    with the hoe to destroy the weeds, and to draw up the soil round the stems.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Red Cabbage,</hi> Brassica oleracea capitata rubra, of
                    which the Red Dutch is the most commonly grown, is much used for pickling. It is
                    sown about the end of J uly, and again in March or April. The Dwarf Red and
                    Utrecht Red are smaller sorts. The culture is in every respect the same as in
                    the other sorts, but the plants have to stand until they form hard close
                    hearts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Couve</hi><hi rend="italic">Tronchuda</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Portugal Cabbage,</hi> Brassica oleracea acephala costata, is of a
                    distinct type and of excellent quality. The fleshy ribs of the leaves, cooked
                    like sea-kale, are the only parts eaten. It is somewhat tender, and requires to
                    be sown early in spring for use during the autumn.</p>
                <p>The names of the varieties of cabbage are very numerous, but, on comparing them
                    at Chiswick, Mr Barron reduces the garden varieties to about seventeen types,
                    the best of which are :— <hi rend="italic">Early sorts</hi>: Atkins’s Matchless,
                    Early York, Little Pixie, Nonpareil, St John’s Day. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mid-season</hi>: Enfield Market (Battersea or Fulham), Rosette Colewort,
                    Winnigstadt. <hi rend="italic">Late sorts</hi>: Bacalan, Hardy Green Colewort,
                    Pomeranian. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cabbage,</hi> vol. iv. p. 617.</p>
                <p>149. The <hi rend="italic">Capsicum</hi> is the produce of several species of the
                    genus Capsicum cultivated for the sake of their pods, which in a green state are
                    used in salads and in pickles, and when ripe are powdered to form cayenne
                    pepper. The pods, either green or ripe, are also used to make Chili vinegar.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Annual Capsicum, Spanish Pepper,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guinea Pepper,</hi> Capsicum annuum, is the sort most commonly grown. The seeds
                    should be sown in a hotbed in February, the young plants being transferred
                    successively into 3-inch, 5-inch, and 8-inch pots. They require a warm genial
                    atmosphere, and a light rich soil, and should be assisted with liquid manure or
                    such artificial fertilizers as Clay’s or Jackman’s. In the south of England they
                    may be grown in the open air, on a warm sunny border, if planted out towards the
                    end of June. The fruit ripens in September, and may be kept two or three years
                    in a dry room. The <hi rend="italic">Bird Pepper,</hi> C. baccatum, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chili,</hi> C. frutescens, are both sub-shrubby plants, requiring
                    stove heat. They should be grown in peaty soil, should not be overpotted, and
                    should be kept dryish at the root in winter. The best cayenne pepper is prepared
                    from C. frutescens, and C. baccatum is much relished by some persons. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Bell Pepper,</hi> C. grossum, and the <hi rend="italic">Large
                    Sweet Spanish,</hi> are milder in flavour than the other sorts, and are much
                    eaten in salads and also with cold meats. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cayenne
                    Pepper,</hi> vol. v. p. 280.</p>
                <p>150. The <hi rend="italic">Cardoon,</hi> Cynara Cardunculus, a perennial from the
                    south of Europe and Barbary, is a near relation of the artichoke (par. 141). The
                    edible part, called the <hi rend="italic">chard,</hi> is composed of the
                    blanched and crisp stalks of the inner leaves. Cardoons are found to prosper on
                    light deep soils. The seed is sown annually about the middle of May, in shallow
                    trenches, like those for celery, and the plants are thinned out to 10 or 12
                    inches from each other in the lines. In Scotland it is preferable to sow the
                    seed singly in small pots, placing them in a mild temperature, and transplanting
                    them into the trenches after they have attained a height of 8 or 10 inches.
                    Water must be copiously supplied in dry weather, both to prevent the formation
                    of flower stalks and to increase the succulence of the leaves. In autumn the
                    leaf-stalks are applied close to each other, and wrapped round with bands of hay
                    or straw, only the points being left free. Earth is then drawn up around them to
                    the height of 15 or 18 inches. ' Sometimes cardoons are blanched by a more
                    thorough earthing up, in the manner of celery, but in this case the operation
                    must be carried on from the end of summer. During severe frost the tops of the
                    leaves should be defended with straw or litter. Besides the common and Spanish
                    cardoons, there are the prickly-leaved Tours cardoon, the red-stemmed cardoon,
                    and the 1’aris cardoon, all of superior quality, the Paris being the largest and
                    most tender. The common artichoke is also used for the production of chard.</p>
                <p>151. The <hi rend="italic">Carrot,</hi> Daucus Carota, has been much improved and
                    transformed from the wild state; it is probably a native of the seacoasts of
                    southern Europe, but is now abundant throughout Europe and Asiatic Russia. The
                    carrot delights in a deep sandy soil, which should be well drained and deeply
                    trenched. In regard to the preparation of the ground, one of our best northern
                    gardeners has said— “Trench in autumn; trench deep and lay the manure at the
                    bottom of the trench; in spring rake down, layon an inch of wood ashes, and dig
                    them lightly in.” For the long-rooted sorts the soil should be at least 3 feet
                    deep, but the Short Horn varieties may be grown in about 6 inches of good
                    compost laid on the top of a less suitable soil. Peat earth may be usefully
                    employed in lightening the soil. Good carrots of the larger sorts may be grown
                    in unfavourable soils by making large holes 18 inches deep with a crowbar, and
                    filling them up with sandy compost in which the seeds are to be sown. The main
                    crop is sown at the end of March or beginning of April. After sowing, it is only
                    necessary to thin the plants, and keep them clear of weeds. The roots are taken
                    up in autumn and stored during winter in a cool shed or cellar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> For a supply of young carrots in winter, a
                    hotbed composed of 3 or 4 feet thick of leaves, or of 18 inches of dung, or of 2
                    feet of dung and leaves mixed, should be prepared about the end of November or
                    beginning of December, and covered with a frame and lights. The bed should be
                    surfaced with 8 or 9 inches of light soil, of which leaf-mould may form
                    aconsiderable proportion, and the seed of Early Short Horn, Early Nantes, or
                    French Forcing should be sown in drills 3 inches apart, and covered to the depth
                    of ⅛ inch. The young plants should be thinned to 1⅜ inches apart. The
                    temperature should range from 60° to 65°, as much light and air being given as
                    possible, but the sashes should be covered at night, especially in frosty
                    weather. For succession sow again on a gentle hotbed under glass early in
                    February, and follow this by another sowing on a warm sheltered south border
                    early in March. The seed bed should be made up of light rich compost, in a
                    situation well exposed to the sun. If these quick-growing sorts are preferred,
                    small successional sowings should be made in May and again in July, James’s
                    Intermediate being substituted at the last sowing. Where <pb break="no"

                <p>152. The <hi rend="italic">Cauliflower,</hi> Brassica oleracea botrytis
                    cauliflora, is said by our old authors to have been introduced from Cyprus,
                    where, as well as on the Mediterranean coasts, it appears to have been
                    cultivated for ages. It is one of the most delicately flavoured of vegetables,
                    the dense cluster formed by its incipient succulent flowerbuds being the edible
                    portion.</p>
                <p>The sowing for the first or spring crop, to be in use in May and June, should be
                    made from the 15th to the 25th of August for England, and from the 1st to the
                    15th of August for Scotland. In the neighbourhood of London the growers adhere
                    as nearly as possible to the 21st day. A sowing to produce heads in July and
                    August takes place in February on a slight hotbed. A late spring sowing to
                    produce cauliflowers in September or October or later, should be made early in
                    April, and another about the 20th of May.</p>
                <p>The cauliflower succeeds best in a rich soil and sheltered position; but, to
                    protect the young plants in winter, they are sometimes pricked out in a warm
                    situation at the foot of a south wall, and in severe weather covered with hoops
                    and mats. A better method is to plant them thickly under a garden frame,
                    securing them from cold by coverings, and giving air in mild weather. For a very
                    early supply, a few scores of plants may be potted and kept under glass during
                    winter, and planted out in spring, defended with a hand-glass. Sometimes patches
                    of three or four plants on a south border are sheltered byhand-glasses
                    throughout the winter. It is advantageous to prick out the spring-sown plants
                    into some sheltered place, before they are finally transplanted in May. The
                    later crop, the transplanting of which may take place at various times, is
                    treated like early cabbages. After planting, all that is necessary is to hoe the
                    ground, and draw up the soil about the stems.</p>
                <p>It is found that cauliflowers ready for use in October may be kept in perfection
                    over winter. For this purpose they are lifted carefully with the spade, keeping
                    a ball of earth attached to the roots. Some of the large outside leaves are
                    removed, and any points of leaves that immediately overhang the flower are cut
                    off. They are then placed either in pots or in hotbed frames, the plants being
                    arranged close together, but without touching. In mild dry weather the glass
                    frames are drawn off, but they are kept close during rain storms; and in severe
                    frost they arc thickly covered λvith mats.</p>
                <p>The late Mr Barnes of Bicton informs us in the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners'
                    Magazine</hi> that his cauliflowers for spring are sown the first week of
                    October, in pans, in a little bottom heat; and about the end of the month, or
                    the beginning of November, are potted into 3-inch pots, and plunged close to the
                    glass. The plants are kept shifted on in some old melon-bed mould until the
                    beginning of January, when they are shifted finally into 7-inch pots. In the
                    first week in February the ground is prepared. If wet, a little of the soil is
                    taken out where each hand-glass is to stand, and replaced with dry dusty
                    rubbish, in order to prevent the cauliflowers from getting the disease of
                    “blacklegs.” Four plants are turned out under each hand-glass. If the weather
                    proves dry, a liquid manure, consisting of i lb of nitrate of soda to 1 hogshead
                    of cow-dung water, with the addition of a few gallons of hot water, is applied,
                    which causes the plants to grow in March as in May, and produce fine
                    cauliflowers early in April.. Mr Barnes states that by shifting on the plants
                    until they are in 12-inch pots, and then placing them in a vinery or
                    peach-house, he has had cauliflowers early in March.</p>
                <p>Some of the best varieties of cauliflower are—the Walcheren, which, if true, is
                    of excellent quality, and the most generally useful for autumn; Dwarf Erfurt,
                    which is very dwarf and early, and good for summer and early autumn use; Early
                    London, rather tall, but with a fine compact curd; Le-normand’s, a second early;
                    Snowball, dwarf, compact, and quick-heading; and Veitch’s Autumn Giant, which is
                    an excellent hardy sort for autumn.</p>
                <p>153. The <hi rend="italic">Celeriac,</hi> Apium graveolens rapaceum, the <hi
                    rend="italic">céleri-navet</hi> of the French, is a variety of celery in which
                    the stem forms an irregular knob, which is the part used, either sliced in
                    salads or cooked. It is a hardy substitute for other kinds of celery. The roots
                    grow to 3 lb or 4 lb weight. The plants should be reared like those of celery;
                    and, some time before winter sets in, they should be taken up and stored amongst
                    sand in a shed or cellar.</p>
                <p>154. The <hi rend="italic">Celery,</hi> Apium graveolens, has been so much
                    improved by cultivation as to have lost its acrid deleterious properties, and is
                    now a stout succulent plant, with a mild and agreeable flavour, and in the finer
                    varieties with the stalks solid instead of hollow and pipy. The blanched
                    portions only should, however, be used.</p>
                <p>Celery is usually sown at three different times,—on a hotbed in the beginning of
                    March, and in the open ground in March, and again in April. The seedlings, when
                    about 2 inches high, are pricked into rich soil, in which they are allowed to
                    stand till they are 4 or 5 inches high. The first crop is defended by frames or
                    hand-glasses, and is planted wide to admit of being lifted with balls of earth
                    adhering to the roots. Towards the end of May trenches for blanching the celery
                    are prepared 3⅛ or 4 feet apart, 15 inches wide at the bottom, and about a foot
                    below the natural level of the surface. The soil at the bottom of the trench is
                    to be carefully dug and manured, and a single row of plants placed in each
                    trench. Sometimes, where a large supply is required, the trenches are made 6
                    feet wide, and rows 15 or 18 inches apart are planted across the trenches. As
                    the plants advance in growth, earth is laid up about the stalks of the leaves,
                    and this is repeated at the end of every ten or fifteen days. Many delay the
                    earthing-up until the plants have nearly attained their full size, when the
                    operation is performed at once; but it is better to commence the earthing-up
                    when the crop is half-grown, and to complete it by adding a little more soil at
                    short intervals. Successional crops should be planted out from the 1st of June
                    till the 1st of August. Celery loves a rich light soil, and will bear to be
                    flooded with water at the root while growing.</p>
                <p>The varieties of celery include some with red stalks and some with white. The
                    latter, as they blanch more perfectly than the red, are sometimes preferred, but
                    the red varieties blanch to a very delicate pink, and are generally better
                    flavoured. Some of the best varieties are <hi rend="italic">Whites</hi>: Early
                    Dwarf Solid White (Incomparable White), Williams’s Matchless White, Wright’s

                    for winter use, it is sown in May or June, commonly in drills, and the plants
                    are thinned out to 4 inches apart. If at first the leaves grow very strong, they
                    are cut off, perhaps in the middle of August, about an inch from the ground, so
                    as to promote the production of new leaves, and check the formation of
                    flower-stems. About the beginning of October the plants are raised from the
                    border, and all the large leaves cut off; the roots are also shortened, and they
                    are then planted pretty closely together in boxes filled with rich light mould,
                    and watered when needful. When frost comes on, the boxes are protected by any
                    kind of litter or haulm. As the salad is wanted, they are removed into some
                    place having a moderately increased temperature, and where there is no light.
                    Each box affords two crops of blanched leaves, and these are reckoned fit for
                    cutting when about 6 inches long.</p>
                <p>Another mode of obtaining the young leaves of this plant in winter is to sow
                    seeds in a bed of light rich mould, or in boxes in a heat of from 55° to 60°,
                    giving a gentle watering as required. The leaves will be fit to cut in a
                    fortnight after sowing, and the plants will afford a second crop.</p>
                <p>In Belgium a variety of chicory called <hi rend="italic">Witloef</hi> is much
                    preferred as a salad to the French <hi rend="italic">Barbe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Capucin.</hi> The seeds are sown and the plants thinned out like those of
                    the ordinary sort. They are eventually planted in light soil, in succession,
                    from the end of October to February, at the bottom of trenches a foot or more in
                    depth, and covered over with from 2 to 3 feet of hot stable manure. In a month
                    or six weeks, according to the heat applied, the heads are fit for use, and
                    should be cut before they reach the manure. The plants might easily be forced in
                    frames on a mild hotbed, or in a mushroom-house, in the same way as
                    sea-kale.</p>
                <p>The sorts cultivated are the Common, the Improved, and the Witloef. That grown
                    for mixing with coffee is a variety with larger fleshy roots. See <hi

                <p>156. The <hi rend="italic">Chives,</hi> Allium Schoenoprasum, is a hardy
                    perennial, found in the North of England and in Cornwall, and growing in rocky
                    pastures throughout temperate and northern Europe and Asiatic Russia, and also
                    in the mountain districts of southern Europe. It is cultivated for the sake of
                    its leaves, which are used in salads and soups as a substitute for young onions.
                    It will grow in any good soil, and is propagated by dividing the roots into
                    small clumps in spring or autumn; these are planted from 8 to 12 inches apart,
                    and soon form large tufts. The leaves should be cut frequently so as to obtain
                    them tender and succulent.</p>

                    Lettuce,</hi> Valerianella olitoria, is a weedy annual, native of southern
                    Europe, but naturalized in cornfields in central Europe, and not unfrequcnt in
                    Britain. In France it is used in salads during winter and spring as a substitute
                    for lettuces, but it is less esteemed in England. The plant is raised from seed
                    sown on a bed or border of light rich earth, and should be weeded and watered,
                    as occasion requires, till winter, when it should be protected with long litter
                    during severe frost. The largest plants should be drawn for use in succession.
                    Sowing may be made every two or three weeks from the beginning of August till
                    October, and again in March, if required in the latter part of the spring. The
                    sorts principally grown are the Round-leaved and the Italian, which last is
                    sometimes referred to Valerianella eriocarpa.</p>
                <p>158. The <hi rend="italic">Cress,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Garden Cress,</hi>
                    Lepidium sativum, is an annual &lt; plant, native of western Central Asia. It is
                    used in salads, the young plants being cut and eaten while still in the
                    seed-leaf, forming, along with plants of the white mustard in the same stage of
                    growth, what is commonly called “small salad.” The seeds should be sown thickly
                    broadcast or in rows in succession every ten or fourteen days, according to the
                    demand. The sowings may be made in the open ground from March till October, the
                    earliest under hand-glasses, and the summer ones in a cool moist situation: but
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n293/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0293-0282"/> during winter they must be raised on a slight
                    hotbed, or in shallow boxes or pans placed in any of the glass-houses where
                    there is a temperature of 60 <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> or 65°.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Golden or Australian Cress</hi> is a dwarf, yellowish
                    green, mild-flavoured sort, which is cut and eaten when a little more advanced
                    in growth, but while still young and tender. It should be sown at intervals of a
                    month from March onwards, the autumn sowing, for winter and spring use, being
                    made in a sheltered situation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Curled</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Normandy Cress</hi> is a
                    very hardy sort, of good flavour. In this, which is allowed to grow like
                    parsley, the leaves are picked for use while young; and, being finely cut and
                    curled, they are well adapted for garnishing. It should be sown thinly in
                    drills, in good soil in the open borders, in March, April, and May, and for
                    winter and spring use at the foot of a south wall early in September, and about
                    the middle of October.</p>
                <p>159. The <hi rend="italic">Cucumber,</hi> Cucumis sativa, a tender annual, is
                    cultivated both for stewing and pickling, but more usually and extensively for
                    salads. Being au annual plant, it is usually increased by seeds, but it may be
                    readily raised from cuttings, which should consist of the tops of the leading
                    branches, and should be planted in deep pots, half-filled with a compost of
                    leaf-mould and sand, the pots being then covered with a pane of glass, and
                    plunged in a brisk heat. To grow these plants successfully through the winter, a
                    tropical heat must be maintained, for the method of doing which see p. ‘264. If
                    properly heated hot-water pits or houses cannot be had, and hotbeds have to be
                    employed, it is better not to attempt very early forcing, but to defer sowing
                    till about the first week in February.</p>
                <p>In hotbed culture, the preparation of materials for the seed-bed, which should
                    consist of stable dung in a full state of fermentation, should be set about
                    towards the middle of January. The dung should be turned over, well shaken, and
                    mixed about three times at intervals of a few days. The bed should be made up in
                    a sheltered situation open to the sun. The frame should then be set on, and the
                    sashes kept closed till the heat rises to 85° or so, when they should be tilted
                    to allow the steam to pass off. In a few days the surface of the bed should be
                    covered with a layer a few inches in thickness of light soil; and as soon as the
                    heat of the bed ranges about 70° the seeds may be sown singly in 3-inch pots of
                    sifted leaf-mould, with a lump of fibrous turf at the bottom for drainage, the
                    seed being moderately pressed into the soil, and covered to the depth of about
                    half an inch. The heat of the bed should range from 75° to 80°. After
                    germination, the plants should be placed within 6 inches of the glass. When the
                    plants have formed two joints, the growing point should be stopped above the
                    second joint, the succeeding young shoots being stopped above the second or
                    third joint. Subsequently three or four of the shoots, as nearly equal in
                    strength as possible, should be selected for principal branches, and the
                    laterals from these should be allowed to fill out the frame and bear fruit; they
                    should be stopped at one or two joints above the fruit, and all weak shoots
                    removed, being pinched off with the finger and-thumb rather than cut, to avoid
                    loss of sap by bleeding. The cucumber is a monoecious plant, and at one time, in
                    order to secure the swelling of the fruit, the female flowers were carefully
                    fertilized; but it is found that this is not necessary unless seed is
                    required.</p>
                <p>The fruiting-bed is to be made up in the same way as the seedbed, only, as it is
                    required to be more lasting, it is better to mix up tree leaves with the dung.
                    The bed may be made up in the first week in February, and should be 4 feet high
                    in front, and 4⅜ feet at back. The frame should be put on at once, and the
                    lights or sashes kept closed till the heat has risen to the surface. If dry the
                    dung may require watering to keep up fermentation; if it is moist and hot it may
                    be found necessary to make holes with a stake in the sides of the bed to
                    moderate the heat; but unless it rises above 85° there is no danger of its
                    injuring the roots. A few days before the plants are introduced some hillocks of
                    soil should be put into the frame, in order that they may become thoroughly
                    warmed. These should be so arranged that the plant is within 6 inches of the
                    glass. The plants themselves should be removed to the frame for a day or two
                    before turning them out, the soil being moist, but not wet. A good medium
                    compost may consist of two parts of turfy loam, one of peat, and one of
                    leaf-mould, with the addition of some clean coarse sand; or of two parts turfy
                    friable loam, two of turfy heath-mould, three of leaf-mould, and one of clean
                    coarse sand. If the loam be of a less fibrous nature, more peat or leafmould or
                    some decayed dung should be used. The bottom heat should range from 75° to 80°,
                    and the atmosphere should be kept moist, and at a temperature ranging from 70°
                    to 80°, the latter by sun-heat. An abundance of light is also essential, but in
                    very bright sunshine a thin shading is beneficial. The water used both at the
                    roots and at the tops should always be warmed, and, while ventilation is to be
                    duly attended to, a cold draught should be avoided.</p>
                <p>Winter cucumbers are generally grown in small houses set apart for them (see p.
                    224). The seeds are sown in August, and planted out so as to become well
                    established before the dull weather sets in. In the case of culture in houses or
                    pits, the heat, bottom and top, is maintained by hot-water pipes or tanks, and
                    the branches are trained over trellises placed about a foot from the glass. The
                    plants must in this case be run up with a single stem, till they reach the upper
                    side of the trellis, when the leader should be stopped in order to produce the
                    branches necessary for covering the allotted space, and these must also be
                    stopped when fruit-bearing laterals are required. These last should be stopped
                    at one joint beyond the fruit, till it can be seen whether or not a shoot will
                    push from the same joint as the fruit, in which case the joint above the fruit
                    is also to be pinched off.</p>
                <p>The hardier varieties of cucumber, especially the short prickly sorts, known as
                    <hi rend="italic">gherkins,</hi> and used for pickling, are often grown under
                    hand-glasses, a cavity having been made in a warm situation, and filled -with
                    hot dung and a small covering of earth. In the southern counties of England,
                    pickling cucumbers are sown in drills in the open ground. The earth is made fine
                    and level, and at distances of 3⅛ feet, in rows 6 feet apart, shallow circular
                    hollows are formed with the hand, a foot wide, and half an inch deep in the
                    middle, in each of which, about the beginning of June, eight or ten seeds are
                    deposited. When the plants appear, they are thinned out to three or four, the
                    weakest or least healthy being rejected, and all the further attention they
                    require is occasional cleaning and watering, according to the state of the
                    weather.</p>

                    rend="italic">Aubergine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Brinjal</hi> of the French, is
                    a tender annual, native of South America and of the tropical parts of Asia and
                    Africa. In France it is cultivated for the fruits, which are cooked before they
                    are eaten. The seed should be sown early in February in a warm pit, where the
                    plants are grown till shifted into 8-inch or 10-inch pots, in well-manured soil.
                    Manure water should be given occasionally while the fruit is swelling, about
                    four fruits being sufficient for a plant. The French growers sow them in a brisk
                    heat in December, or early in January, and in March plant them out four or eight
                    in a hotbed with a bottom heat of from 60° to 68°, the sashes being gradually
                    more wi·lely opened as the season advances, until they may be taken off by about
                    the end of May. The two main branches which are allowed are pinched to induce
                    laterals, but when the fruits are set all young shoots are taken off in order to
                    increase their size. The best variety is the Large Purple, which produces oblong
                    fruit, sometimes reaching 6 or 7 inches in length, and 10 or 12 inches in
                    circumference. The Chinese is also an oblong-fruited sort, with white fruit and
                    more juicy flesh than some of the other sorts. The fruit of the ordinary form
                    almost exactly resembles the egg of the domestic fowl.</p>
                <p>161. The <hi rend="italic">Endive,</hi> Cichorium Endivia, is a hardy annual,
                    native of the northern provinces of China and other parts of Asia. As in the
                    case of the lettuce, the blanched hearts are used for salads and in soups. The
                    main crop should be sown about the middle of June, on a seed-bed of light rich
                    soil, and the early crop about the middle of May. The seeds should be scattered
                    sparsely, that the plants may not come up in clusters. The seedlings should be
                    transplanted into a rich soil in an open situation, at about a foot apart in
                    rows, which for the curled-leaved sorts should be a foot asunder, and for the
                    broad-leaved sorts 15 inches. When the plants have reached their maturity, the
                    leaves are gathered up and tied together a little below the tips, and a few days
                    later about the middle of the plant, and in two or three weeks they are found
                    sufficiently blanched for use.</p>
                <p>For winter use the seed should be sown about the middle of July, and a little
                    additional in August. They should be planted in the same way as the earlier
                    crops, but it is advisable, as they approach maturity, to draw the earth quite
                    up about the leaves. At that season, too, the plants may be advantageously
                    planted on sloping banks of earth facing south. They may be blanched by
                    inverting a garden pot with the drainage hole closed, ora common garden saucer
                    10 or 12 inches in diameter, over the centre of the plants as they grow flat on
                    the earth. Later on they may be blanched in boxes in the mushroom-house, or in a
                    cellar, or by using blanching pots, such as are provided for sea-kale. The time
                    occupied in blanching varies from ten days in summer to three weeks in winter. A
                    sufficient quantity to afford a supply for a week may be operated on at one
                    time.</p>
                <p>For protection during the winter it is a good plan to plant the endive on
                    November, at 6 or 8 inches apart, on sloping sheltered banks facing the south,
                    covering it with litter in severe weather, but leaving it uncovered at all other
                    times. A more certain method to obtain a supply during that season is, however,
                    either to take up the late-sown plants before frost sets in, and to plant them
                    in dry earth or sand in a frame, or to place a frame over them where they grow.

                <p>There are two races of endives, the Curled <hi rend="italic">(Chicorée
                    frisée</hi> of the French), with crispy much-cut leaves, and the Batavian <hi
                    rend="italic">(Scarole</hi> of the French), with broad lettuce-like leaves. Some
                    of the favourite sorts are—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Curled</hi>: French Small Green Curled, early; Large Green
                    Curled; Staghorn, for late crops; and Curled Piepus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Batavian</hi>: Small Batavian, Round-leaved Batavian;
                    Lettuce-leaved, early; and Fraser’s Broad-leaved Batavian, for late crops.</p>
                <p>162. The <hi rend="italic">Garlic,</hi> Allium sativum, a har&lt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> y bulbous perennial, is propagated by separating the
                    cloves of which the bulbs are composed, and planting them 2 to 3 inches deep in
                    spring, at a few inches apart, in rows a foot asunder, in a light, rich, and
                    rather dry soil, and in a warm situation. A few short rows will suffice in most
                    cases, and, if required early, a small patch may also be planted about the end
                    of October. After the leaves have ripened, the bulbs may be taken up, sun-dried,
                    tied in bunches by the stalks, and hung up in a dry airy cool store-room till
                    wanted. Garlic is used for flavouring.</p>
                <p>163. The <hi rend="italic">Gourds</hi> cultivated in gardens for their esculent
                    produce are varieties of several species of Cucurbita, the most commonly used
                    being the vegetable marrow and the pumpkin.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Marrow,</hi> Cucurbita Pepo var., is the most
                    important of the gourds used as an esculent, and furnishes in good seasons a
                    very large supply for the table. The fruits are best when eaten quite young and
                    not over-boiled, the flesh being then tender, and the flavour sweet and
                    nutty.</p>
                <p>Vegetable marrows require a warm situation and a rich soil free from stagnant
                    moisture. They do well on a rubbish or old-dung heap, or in a warm border on
                    little hillocks made up with any fermenting material, to give them a slight
                    warmth at starting. The seeds should be sown in a warm pit in April, and
                    forwarded under glass, but in a very mild heat; the plants must be shifted into
                    larger pots, and be gradually hardened previous to being planted out, when the
                    mild weather sets in in May or June. The use of handglasses makes it possible to
                    transplant earlier than would otherwise be advisable. The seeds may be sown
                    early in May in pots under a hand-glass, or towards the end of May in the open
                    ground, if heat is not at command. The true vegetable marrow or succade gourd
                    bears fruit of an oblong-elliptical shape, about 9 inches long, pale-greenish
                    while young, with whitish flesh, and scarcely any indication of ribs; when
                    mature it is of a pale yellow colour. There is a variety which is more oblong,
                    grows to 15 or 18 inches, and has the surface slightly marked by irregular
                    longitudinal obtuse ribs. The shoots may be allowed to run along the surface of
                    the ground, or they may be trained against a wall or paling, or on trellise’s.
                    As the gourds cross readily, care is necessary to keep any particular variety
                    true. One of the best vegetable marrows is called Moore’s Vegetable Cream.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Custard Marrow,</hi> one of the Patissons or Crown Gourds,
                    bears a peculiar-looking flattened fruit with scolloped edges, which has a
                    sweeter and less nutty flavour than the true marrow.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pumpkin,</hi> Cucurbita maxima, grows to a very large size,
                    some of the varieties, as the large yellow or <hi rend="italic">Potiron
                    jaune,</hi> sometimes producing fruit over 200 lb in weight. The flesh of this
                    is yellow, the ripe fruit, in which state only it is used, being of a pale
                    salιnony buff colour exteriorly. It will keep for some months in a dry airy
                    place, and is used in soups or stews, or mashed like potatoes, or baked in pies.
                    There are several varieties of this type. The cultivation of the pumpkin
                    resembles that of the vegetable marrow, but it requires abundance of space for
                    its spreading vines.</p>
                <p>Many of the other gourds (of which some are very ornamental) produce edible
                    fruits, but as some, notably the orange gourd and the bottle gourd, are
                    cathartic and deleterious, they should not be indiscriminately eaten.</p>
                <p>164. The <hi rend="italic">Horseradish,</hi> Cochlearia Armoracia, or Armoracia
                    rusticana, a hardy perennial, is cultivated for its long roots, or more properly
                    underground rootstocks, which when scraped into shreds, or grated and made into
                    a delicious sauce, are eaten with roast beef. Its properties are antiscorbutic.
                    The horseradish requires a deep, rich, and rather moist sandy loam or alluvial
                    soil, the object being to obtain long straight roots. One method of producing
                    new plants is to plant the sets, consisting of the crowns of old roots, or of 1
                    or 2 inch lengths of the root itself, at the bottom of a trench 2⅜ feet deep,
                    the lower half of the soil being well manured; only a single shoot should be
                    retained, so as to produce one thick vigorous stick. The roots planted in spring
                    are sometimes taken up in the w inter following; if left to grow another year
                    they become very much thicker, though less tender. In digging the roots the soil
                    should be thrown back so as to lay them bare. Those that spring from the set are
                    cut off, and it is manured and left to grow up again the following year. Before
                    the ground becomes frost-bound, a supply should be dug up, and stored in damp
                    sand for use during that emergency.</p>
                <p>165. The <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> Helianthus tuberosus, a
                    hardy tuberous perennial, a species of sunflower, derives its epithet <hi
                    rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi> from a corruption of the Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Girasole,</hi> a sunflower, and its name of <hi rend="italic">Artichoke</hi>
                    from the resemblance in flavour which its tubers bear to that of the receptacles
                    or “bottoms” of that plant. It is propagated by means of its tubers planted in
                    the manner of potatoes, in rows 3 or 4 feet asunder, some time in February or
                    March; by the autumn the new tubers will be fit for use. As a matter of
                    convenience, though the tubers themselves are hardy enough to bear the frosts of
                    winter, they may be dug up about November, and stored in dryish sand. They
                    should have a well-manured soil, and the stems should not be allowed to be too
                    crowded, which is in great measure obviated by planting them annually.</p>
                <p>166. The <hi rend="italic">Kidney Bean</hi> includes what is commonly known as
                    the French Bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, and the Scarlet Runner, Phaseolus
                    multiflorus, both very productive vegetables of excellent quality.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Common Kidney Bean</hi> or <hi rend="italic">French
                    Bean,</hi> Phaseolus vulgaris, is a tender annual, and should be grown in a rich
                    light loamy soil and a warm sheltered situation. The soil should be well
                    enriched with hotbed dung. The earliest crop may be sown by the end of March or
                    beginning of April. If, however, the temperature of the soil is below 45°, the
                    beans make but little progress. The main crops should be got in early in May;
                    and a later sowing may be made early in July. The earlier plantings may be sown
                    in small pots, and put in frames or houses, until they can be safely planted
                    out-of-doors. The earliest out-of-doors crop may be sheltered by means of
                    thatched hurdles, placed sloping on bearers supported by posts. The seeds should
                    be covered 1⅜ or 2 inches deep, the distance between the rows being about 2
                    feet, or for the dwarfest sorts 18 inches, and that between plants from 4 to 6
                    inches. The pods may be used as a green vegetable, in which case they should be
                    gathered whilst they are so crisp as to be readily snapped in two when bent; but
                    when the dry seeds are to be used, the pods should be allowed to ripen. As the
                    green pods are gathered others will continue to be formed in abundance; but if
                    old seed-forming pods are allowed to remain, the formation of young ones will be
                    greatly checked.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The kidney bean may be easily forwarded in pots
                    in a forcing-house, or in prepared soil in a heated pit. The bottom heat should
                    range about 70°, and the atmospheric temperature should show a minimum of 60°,
                    and a maximum of 70°, running up to 80° by sun-heat. The seed should be sown
                    three or four in a 10- inch pot, nearly filled with light turfy soil and
                    leaf-mould, or decomposed cow dung, the stems being earthed up after the true
                    leaves are formed; and they must be well syringed and watered daily. To keep
                    down the red spider, the under side of the leaves should be thoroughly moistened
                    'by syringing early in the morning with water at 60°; the house being then kept
                    shut up till the air is raised to 75° or 80°, both surfaces will, in consequence
                    of condensation, become thoroughly wetted. When the plants come into flower,
                    plenty of air must be admitted. Kidney beans may thus be obtained fit for use,
                    in six weeks or two months from the time of sowing. It may therefore be
                    desirable to sow some seed in August to succeed the crops in the open ground,
                    and, for succession, in September and October; for spring use sow in January,
                    February, and March. The early dwarf sorts are the best for forcing, such as
                    Fulmer’s Early, Newington Wonder, Osborn’s Forcing, Williams’s Early Prolific,
                    Syon House, and White Advancer.</p>
                <p>The varieties of French beans being numerous, we here add the names of some of
                    the most desirable for general cultivation:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Early</hi>: White Canterbury, Fulmer’s Forcing, Minier’s First
                    Early, Osborn’s Forcing, Sir "Joseph Paxton, White Advancer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Early:</hi> Canadian Wonder, bears late; Negro
                    Long-podded, bears late; New Mammoth Negro, earlier than Canadian Wonder;
                    Newington Wonder; Pale Dun; Syon House; Williams’s Prolific, bears late.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Scarlet Runner Bean,</hi> Phaseolus multiflorus, differs
                    from the common French bean in being a perennial, and in having tuberous roots,
                    which, it may be stated, are narcotic and poisonous. These may be preserved
                    through the winter in dryish earth in a frost-proof cellar, for an early crop
                    the following season. The late Mr Cuthill mentions having found from experiment
                    that plants raised from roots come into bearing just one month earlier than
                    those raised from seed. The seeds of the runner beans should be sown in an open
                    plot,—the first sowing in May, another at the beginning of June, and a third
                    about the middle of June. In the London market-gardens they are sown 8 to 12
                    inches apart, in 4 feet rows if the soil is good. The twining tops are pinched
                    or cut off when the plants are from 2 to 2⅛ feet high, to save the expense of
                    staking. It is better, however, in private gardens to have the rows standing
                    separately, and to support the plants by stakes 6 or 7 feet high and about a
                    foot apart, the tops of the stakes being crossed about one-third down. If the
                    weather is dry when the pods are forming abundantly, plenty of tepid water
                    should be supplied to the plants. In training the shoots to their supports, they
                    should be twined from right to left, contrary to the course of the sun, or they
                    will not lay hold.</p>
                <p>The ordinary Scarlet Runner is most commonly grown, but there is a white-flowered
                    variety which has also white seeds; this is very prolific and of excellent
                    quality, and is now much grown for market. Another variety called Painted Lady,
                    with the flowers red and white, is very ornamental, but not so productive.
                    Carter’s Champion is a large-podded productive variety.</p>
                <p>167. The <hi rend="italic">Kohl Rabi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Turnip

                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n295/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0295-0284"/>, is a biennial, the upper part of whose stem
                    swells into a round fleshy mass, resembling a turnip, but produced above ground.
                    Kohl Rabi is exceedingly hardy, withstanding both severe frosts and
                    drou&lt;*.ιt. It is not much grown in English gardens, though when used young it
                    forms a good substitute for turnips. The seeds should be sown in May and June,
                    and the seedlings should be planted shallowly in well-manured ground, 8 or 10
                    inches apart, in rows 15 inches asunder; and they should be well watered, so as
                    to induce quick growth. The bulbs will be fit for use when they are as large
                    as—not larger than—an early turnip. The best sorts are Early White Vienna, and
                    Early Purple Vienna.</p>
                <p>168. The <hi rend="italic">Leek,</hi> Allium Porrum, a hardy biennial, is said to
                    be a native of Switzerland, but more probably comes from the East. The leeks,
                    which prefer a light soil, are sown in beds about the middle of March, and later
                    for a succession, and in June or July are planted out 6 inches asunder; and in
                    rows 15 or 18 inches apart. When the weather is moist the plants are dropped
                    upright into the hole made by the dibble, and no more earth than will just cover
                    the fibres is allowed to fall in, the hole being left open to encourage the stem
                    to swell out, and blanching is effected gradually by the earth washing into the
                    hole. They are also planted in trenches like celery, and earthed up when they
                    have made their growth. The leeks will be fit for use in September, and will
                    last till the spring.</p>
                <p>The best sorts are—Early Netherlands, for early use; Large Rouen, one of the very
                    best; London Flag, and Musselburgh, the latter being reputedly the hardiest; and
                    Carentan, a very large hardy French sort.</p>
                <p>169. The <hi rend="italic">Lettuce,</hi> Lactuca sativa, is a hardy annual,
                    highly esteemed as a salad plant, while its milky juice forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">lactucarium</hi> of the materia medica. The London
                    market-gardeners make preparation for the first main crop of Cos lettuces in the
                    open ground early in August, a frame being set on a shallow hotbed, and, the
                    stimulus of heat not being required, this is allowed to subside till the first
                    week in October, when the soil, consisting of leafmould mixed with a little
                    sand, is put on 6 or 7 inches thick, so that the surface is within 4⅜ inches of
                    the sashes. The best time for sowing is found to be about the 11th of October.
                    When the seeds begin to germinate the sashes are drawn quite off in favourable
                    weather during the day, and put on, but tilted, at night in wet weather. Very
                    little watering is required, and the aim should be to keep the plants gently
                    moving till the days begin to lengthen. In January a more active growth is
                    encouraged, and in mild winters a considerable extent of the planting out is
                    done, but in private gardens the preferable time would be February. The ground
                    should be light and rich, and well manured below, and the plants put out at 1
                    foot apart each way. In planting at this early season, the dibble, in closing in
                    the soil, should be inserted on the south side of the plant. Frequent stirring
                    of the ground with the hoe greatly encourages the growth of the plants. A second
                    sowing should be made about the 5th of November, and a third in frames about the
                    end of January or beginning of February. In March a sowing may be made in some
                    warm situation; successional sowings may be made in the open border till August,
                    about the middle of which month a crop of Brown Cos and Hardy Hammersmith should
                    be sown, the latter being the most reliable in a severe winter. These plants may
                    be put out early in October on the sides of ridges facing the south or at the
                    front of a south wall, beyond the reach of drops from the copings, the Hardy
                    Hammersmith being planted •6 or 8 inches apart. Young lettuce plants should be
                    thinned before they crowd or draw each other, and transplanted as soon as
                    possible after two or three leaves are formed. Some cultivators prefer that the
                    summer crops should not be transplanted, but sown where they are to stand, the
                    plants being merely thinned out; but transplanting checks the running to seed,
                    and makes the most of the ground.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> For a winter supply by gentle forcing, the Hardy
                    Hammersmith and Brown Dutch Cabbage lettuces, and the Brown Cos and Green Paris
                    Cos lettuces, should be sown about the middle of August and in the beginning of
                    September, in rich light soil, the plants being pricked out 3 inches apart in a
                    prepared bed, as soon as the first two leaves are fully formed. About the middle
                    of October the plants should be taken up carefully with balls attached to the
                    roots, and should be placed in a mild hotbed of well-prepared dung (about 55°)
                    covered about 1 foot deep with a compost of sandy peat, leaf-mould, and a little
                    well-decomposed manure. The Cos and Brown Dutch varieties should be planted
                    about 9 inches apart. Give plenty of air when the weather permits, and protect
                    from frost.</p>
                <p>There are two races of the lettuce, the Cos lettuce, with erect oblong heads, and
                    the Cabbage lettuce, with round or spreading heads,—the former generally crisp,
                    the latter soft and flabby in texture. Some of the best lettuces for general
                    purposes of the two classes are the following :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cos</hi>: White Paris Cos, best for summer; Green Paris Cos,
                    hardier than the white; Alphange Cos, stands well; Brown Cos, one of the

                    winter; Tom Thumb; Brown Dutch; Neapolitan, best for summer; Grand Admiral,

                <p>170. The <hi rend="italic">Mushroom,</hi> Agaricus campestris, is a well-known
                    fungus of a specially savoury character; it grows wild in Great Britain on
                    upland pastures, and appears to be indigenous to most regions of the globe. The
                    plant is propagated by spores, the fine black dust seen to be thrown ofl' when a
                    mature specimen is laid on white paper or a white dish; these give rise to what
                    is known as the ‘ ‘ spawn” or mycelium, which consists of whitish threads
                    permeating dried dung or similar substances, and which, when planted in a proper
                    medium, runs through the mass, and eventually appears in the form of the
                    mushroom. This spawn may be obtained from old pastures, or decayed mushroom
                    beds, and is purchased from nurserymen in the form of bricks charged with the
                    mycelium, and technically known as mushroom spawn. When once obtained, it may,
                    like leaven, be indefinitely preserved. It may be produced by placing quantities
                    of horse dung saturated with the urine of horses, especially of stud horses,
                    with alternate layers of rich earth, and covering the whole with straw, to
                    exclude rain and air; the spawn commonly appears in the heap in about two months
                    afterwards. The droppings of stall-fed horses, or of such as have been kept on
                    dry food, should be made use of.</p>
                <p>The old method of growing mushrooms in ridges out of doors, or on prepared beds
                    either level or sloping from a back wall in sheds or cellars, may generally
                    be.adopted with success. The beds are formed of horse droppings which have been
                    slightly fermented and frequently turned, and may be made 2 or 3 feet broad, and
                    of any length. A layer of dung about 8 or 10 inches thick is first deposited,
                    and covered with light dryish earth to the depth of 2 inches; and two similar
                    layers with similar coverings are added, the whole being made narrower as it
                    advances in height. When the bed is finished, it is covered with straw to
                    protect it from rain, and also from parching influences. In about ten days, when
                    the mass is milkwarm, the bed will be ready for spawning, which consists of
                    inserting small pieces of spawn bricks into the sloping sides of the bed, about
                    6 inches asunder. A layer of fine earth is then placed over the whole, and well
                    beaten down, and the surface is covered with a thick coat of straw. When the
                    weather is temperate, mushrooms will appear in about a month after the bed has
                    been made, but at other times a much longer period may elapse. The principal
                    things to be attended to are to preserve a moderate state of moisture and a
                    proper mild degree of warmth; and the treatment must vary according to the
                    season.</p>
                <p>Mr Cuthill describes a very simple mode of culture. The ridge is built up of dung
                    as it is brought fresh from the London stables; in this fermentation soon sets
                    in, and, when the heat of the bed declines to 80°, pieces of spawn bricks are
                    inserted, a foot apart, in the sides of the bed, which is then moulded over, 2
                    inches thick, pressed with the feet, and beaten with the spade, then watered,
                    and beaten again with the spade, and finally smoothed down. The more the mould
                    is pressed, the finer the crop, and the more solid the texture of the
                    mushroom.</p>
                <p>These ordinary ridge beds furnish a good supply towards the end of summer, and in
                    autumn. To command a regular supply, however, at all seasons, the use of a
                    mushroom-house (see par. 13, p. 226) will be found very convenient. The material
                    employed in all cases is the droppings of horses, which should be collected
                    fresh, and spread out in thin layers in a dry place, a portion of the short
                    litter being retained well moistened by horse urine. It should then be thrown
                    together in ridges and frequently turned, so as to be kept in an incipient state
                    of fermentation, a little dryish friable loam being mixed with it to retain the
                    ammonia given off by the dung. With this or a mixture of horse-dung, loam, old
                    mushroom-bed dung, and half-decayed leaves, the beds are built up in successive
                    layers of about 3 inches thick, each layer being beaten firm, until the bed is 9
                    or 10 inches thick. If the heat exceeds 80°, holes should be made to moderate
                    the fermentation. The beds are to be spawned when the heat moderates, and the
                    surface is then covered with a sprinkling of warmed loam, which after a few days
                    is made up to a thickness of 2 inches, and well beaten down. The beds made
                    partly of old mushroom-bed dung often contain sufficient spawn to yield a crop,
                    without the introduction of brick or cake spawn, but it is advisable to spawn
                    them in the regular way. The spawn should be introduced an inch or two below the
                    surface when the heat has declined to about 75°, indeed the bed ought never to
                    exceed 80°. The surface is to be afterwards covered with hay or litter. The
                    atmospheric temperature should range from 60° to 65° till the mushrooms appear,
                    when it may drop a few degrees, but not lower than 55°. If the beds require
                    watering, water of about 80° should be used, and it is preferable to moisten the
                    covering of litter rather than the surface of the beds themselves. It is also
                    beneficial, especially in the case of partially exhausted beds, to water with a
                    dilute solution of nitre. For a winter supply the beds should be made towards
                    the end of August, and the end of October.</p>
                <p>171. The <hi rend="italic">Mustard,</hi> Sinapis alba, or Brassica alba, is a
                    hardy annual, used as a small salad—generally accompanied by garden cress—while
                    still in the seed-leaf. To keep up a supply, the seed should be sown every week
                    or ten days. The sowings in the open ground may be made from March till October,
                    earlier or later according to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n296/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0296-0285"/> season. The ground should be light and rich, and
                    the situation warm and sheltered. Sow thickly in rows 6 inches apart, and
                    slightly cover the seed, pressing the surface smooth with the back of the spade.
                    When gathering the crop, cut the young plants off even with the ground, or pull
                    them up and cut off the roots, commencing at one end of a row. From October to
                    March the seeds should be sown thickly in shallow boxes and placed in a warm
                    house or frame, with a temperature not below 65°.</p>
                <p>172. The <hi rend="italic">Nasturtium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian
                    Cress,</hi> Tropaeolum majus, is a perennial climber, native of Peru, but in
                    cultivation treated as a hardy annual. The flowers are sometimes eaten in
                    salads, and are used for garnishing, and the leaves and young green fruits are
                    pickled in vinegar as a substitute for capers. The plant should have a warm
                    situation, and the soil should be light and well enriched; sow thinly early in
                    April, either near a fence or wall, which may be utilized for its support, or in
                    an open spot, where it will require stakes 6 to 8 feet high. Its flowers are no
                    less ornamental than useful.</p>
                <p>173. The <hi rend="italic">New Zealand Spinach,</hi> Tetragonia expansa, is a
                    half-hardy annual, native of New Zealand, sometimes used as a substitute
                    for’spinach during the summer months, but in every way inferior to it. The seeds
                    should be sown in March, on a gentle hotbed, having been previously steeped in
                    water for several hours. The seedlings should be potted, and placed under a
                    frame till the end of May, and should then be planted out, in light rich soil.
                    The young leaves are those which are gathered for use, a succession being
                    produced during summer and autumn.</p>
                <p>174. The <hi rend="italic">Onion,</hi> Allium Cepa, is a hardy bulbous biennial,
                    which has been cultivated in Britain from time immemorial, but the native
                    country of which is unknown. The onion should be grown in an open situation, and
                    on a light, rich, well-worked soil, which has not been recently manured. The
                    principal crop may be sown at any time from the middle of February to the middle
                    of March, if the weather is fine and the ground sufficiently dry. The seed,
                    should be sown in shallow drills, 10 inches apart, the ground being made as
                    level and firm as possible, and the plants should be regularly thinned, hoed,
                    and kept free from weeds. At the final thinning they should be set from 3 to 6
                    inches apart, the latter distance in very rich soil. About the beginning of
                    September the crop is ripe, which is known by the withering of the leaves; the
                    bulbs are then to be pulled, and exposed on the ground till well dried, and they
                    are then to be put away in a store-room or loft, where they may be perfectly
                    secured from frost and damp.</p>
                <p>About the end of August a crop is sown to afford a supply of young onions in the
                    spring months. Those which are not required for the kitchen, if allowed to
                    stand, and if the flower-bud is picked out on its first appearance, and the
                    earth stirred about them, frequently produce bulbs equal in size and quality to
                    the large ones that are imported from the Continent. A crop of very large bulbs
                    may also be secured by sowing about the beginning of September, and
                    transplanting early in spring to very rich soil. Another plan is to sow in May
                    on dry poor soil, when a crop of small bulbs will be produced; these are to be
                    stored in the usual way, and planted in rich soil about February, on ground made
                    firm by treading, in rows about a foot apart, the bulbs being set near the
                    surface, and about 6 inches asunder. The White Spanish and Tripoli are good
                    sorts for this purpose.</p>
                <p>To obtain a crop of bulbs for pickling, seed should be sown thickly in March, in
                    rather poor soil, the seeds being very thinly covered, and the surface well
                    rolled; these are not to be thinned, but should be pulled and harvested when
                    ripe. The best sorts for this crop are the Silver-skinned, Early Silver-skinned,
                    Nocera, and Queen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> Onions may be forced like mustard and cress if
                    required for winter salads, the seeds being sown thickly in boxes which are to
                    be placed in a warm house or frame. The young onions are of course pulled while
                    quite small.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Potato Onion,</hi> Allium Cepa aggregatum, is propagated by
                    the lateral bulbs, which it throws out, under ground, in considerable numbers.
                    This variety is very prolific, and is useful when other sorts do not keep well.
                    It is sometimes planted about midwinter, and then ripens in summer, but for use
                    during the spring and early summer it is best planted in spring. It is also
                    known as the underground onion, from its habit of producing its bulbs beneath
                    the surface.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tree Onion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Egyptian Onion,</hi>
                    Allium Cepaproliferum, produces small bulbs instead of flowers, and a few
                    offsets also underground. These small stem bulbs are excellent for pickling.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Welsh Onion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ciboule,</hi> Allium
                    fistulosum, is a hardy perennial, native of Siberia. It forms no bulbs, but, on
                    account of its extreme hardiness, is sown in July or early in August, to furnish
                    a reliable supply of young onions for use in salads during the early spring.
                    These bulbless onions are sometimes called Scallions, a name which is also
                    applied to old onions which have stem and leaves but no bulbs.</p>
                <p>The following are among the best varieties of onions for various purposes :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Far summer and autumn.—</hi> Queen; Early White Naples: these
                    two sorts are also excellent for sowing in autumn for spring salading.

                <p>175. The <hi rend="italic">Orach</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mountain Spinach,</hi>
                    Atriplex hortensis, native of Tartary, is a tall-growing hardy annual, whose
                    leaves, though coarsely flavoured, are used as a substitute for spinach, and to
                    correct the acidity, of sorrel. The White and the Green are the most desirable
                    varieties. The plant should be grown quickly in rich soil. It may be sown in
                    rows <hi rend="italic">2</hi> feet apart, and about the same distance in the
                    row, about March, and for succession again in June. If needful, water must be
                    freely given, so as to maintain a rapid growth.</p>
                <p>176. The <hi rend="italic">0xalis</hi><hi rend="italic">crenata,</hi> Oca of the
                    South Americans, is a tuberous-rooted half-hardy perennial, native of Peru. Its
                    tubers are comparatively small, and somewhat acid; but if they be exposed to the
                    sun from six to ten days, they become sweet and floury. In the climate of
                    England they can only be grown by starting them in heat in March, and planting
                    out in June in a light soil and warm situation. They grow freely enough, but few
                    tubers are formed, and these of small size. The fleshy stalks, which have the
                    acid flavour of the family, may, however, be used in the same way as rhubarb for
                    tarts. The leaves may be eaten in salads. It is easily propagated by cuttings of
                    the stems, or by means of sets like the potato.</p>

                    tapering, white, semi-transparent roots, about 4 inches in length, and 3 to 4
                    inches in diameter. They strike down into the soil, which should therefore be
                    made light and rich with abundance of decayed vegetable matter. The bulbs should
                    be planted about the end of April, 6 inches apart, in rows 1 foot asunder, being
                    only just covered with soil, and having a situation with a southern aspect. The
                    roots should be dug up before they become affected by frost, but if protected
                    they will continue to increase in size till November. When taken up, the bulbs
                    should be stored in a cool dry place for replanting, and the roots for use. The
                    roots are gently boiled with salt and water, peeled and eaten like asparagus
                    with melted butter and the yolks of eggs, or served up like salsafy and
                    scorzonera with white sauce.</p>
                <p>178. The <hi rend="italic">Parsnip,</hi> Pastinaca sativa, is a hardy biennial,
                    found in temperate regions. Its long tapering fleshy whitish nutritious roots
                    have a peculiar but agreeable flavour. It succeeds best on a free sandy loam,
                    which should be trenched and manured in the previous autumn, the manure being
                    well buried. The seed should be sown thinly in March, in rows, 18 inches apart,
                    and finally thinned out to 1 foot apart. The leaves will decay in October or
                    November, when a portion of the roots may be taken up and stored in dryish, sand
                    for immediate use, the rest being left in the ground, to be taken up as
                    required, but the whole should be removed by February to a dry cool place, or
                    they will begin to grow. The best sorts are the Hollow-crowned, the Maltese, and
                    the Student.</p>
                <p>179. The <hi rend="italic">Pea,</hi> Pisum sativum, is a hardy annual, climbing
                    by means of the tendrils of its leaves, and has been cultivated from time
                    immemorial. The seeds or pulse are very nutritious, whether eaten green or ripe,
                    and those of the early crops are esteemed as luxuries.</p>
                <p>The pea prefers a friable calcareous loam, deeply worked, and well enriched with
                    good hotbed or farm-yard manure. The early crops require a warm sheltered
                    situation, but the later are better grown 6 or 8 feet apart, or more, in the
                    open quarters, dwarf crops being introduced between the rows. The dwarf or early
                    sorts may be sown 3 or 4 feet apart. The deep working of the soil is of
                    importance, lest the plants should suffer in hot dry weather from mildew or
                    arrest of growth. The first sowing should be made about the beginning or middle
                    of November, in front of a south wall, the plants being defended by spruce fir
                    branches or other spray throughout the winter. In February sowings are sometimes
                    made in flower-pots or boxes, and the young plants afterwards planted out. The
                    main crop should be sown towards the end of February, and moderate sowings
                    should be made twice a month afterwards, up to the beginning of July for the
                    north, and about the third week in July for warmer districts. During dry hot
                    weather late peas derive great benefit from mulching and watering. The latest
                    sowings, at the middle or end of August, should consist of the best early sorts,
                    as they are not so long in producing pods as the larger and finer sorts, and by
                    this means the supply may be prolonged till October or November. As they grow up
                    the earth is drawn to the stems, which are also supported by stakes, a practice
                    which in a well-kept garden is always advisable, although it is said that the
                    early varieties arrive sooner at maturity when recumbent. Where space permits,
                    all the taller sorts are best sown in single rows at wide intervals of 20 or 30
                    feet.</p>
                <p>Peas grown late in autumn are subject to mildew, to obviate which Mr Knight
                    proposed to dig over the ground in the usual way, and to soak the spaces to be
                    occupied by the rows of peas thoroughly with water,—the earth on each side to be
                    then collected so as to form ridges 7 or 8 inches high, these ridges being well
                    watered, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0297-0286"/> and the seed sown on them in single rows. If dry
                    weather at any time set in, water should be supplied profusely once a week.</p>
                <p>To produce very early crops the French market-gardeners sow early in November, in
                    frames, on a border having a good aspect, the seeds being covered very slightly.
                    The young plants are transplanted into other frames in December, the ground
                    inside being dug out so as to be 18 or 20 inches below the sashes, and the earth
                    thus removed placed against the outside of the frames. The young plants, when 3
                    or 4 inches high, are planted in patches of three or four, 8 inches asunder, in
                    four longitudinal rows. The sashes are covered at night with straw mats, and
                    opened whenever the weather is sufficiently mild. When 8 or 10 inches high, the
                    stems are inclined towards the back of the frame, a little earth being drawn to
                    their base, and when the plants come into blossom the tops are pinched out,
                    above the third or fourth flower, to force them into bearing. As soon as they
                    begin to pod, the soil may have a gentle watering, whenever sufficiently warmed
                    by the sun, but a too vigorous growth at an earlier period would be detrimental.
                    Thus treated the plants bear pods fit for gathering in the first fortnight in
                    April.</p>
                <p>A very convenient means of obtaining an early crop is to sow in 5-inch pots, a
                    few seeds in each, the plants to be ultimately planted out on a warm border.
                    Peas may also be obtained early if gently forced in frames, in the same way as
                    kidney beans, the dwarfest varieties being preferable.</p>
                <p>For the very early peas the rows should range east and west, but for the main
                    crops north and south. The average depth of the drills should be about 2 inches
                    for small sorts, and a trifle more for the larger kinds. The drills should be
                    made wide and flat at bottom, so that the seeds may be better separated in
                    sowing. The large sorts are the better for being sown 3 inches apart. Chopped
                    furze may be advantageously scattered in the drill before covering in, to check
                    the depredations of mice, and before levelling the surface the soil should be
                    gently trodden down over the seeds.</p>
                <p>A good selection of sorts may be made from the following <hi rend="italic"
                    >Early</hi>: Dillistone’s Early (Sutton’s Ringleader, Carter's First Crop), the
                    earliest sort; Sangster’s No. 1, a good form of Early Frame; William I., fine;
                    Laxton’s Alpha, the earliest wrinkled pea; Dickson's First and Best; Maclean’s
                    Little Gem, a very dwarf wrinkled pea; Tom Thumb (Beck’s Gem), a very dwarf
                    round pea. The last two are useful for forcing and for pots.</p>

                    cold wet soils and seasons; General Wyndham, continues to produce very late;
                    British Queen, Champion of England, Laxton’s Omega.</p>
                <p>180. The <hi rend="italic">Potato,</hi> Solanum tuberosum, is a half-hardy
                    perennial, producing underground tubers, largely used as an esculent. It thrives
                    best in a rather light friable loam; and in thin sandy soils the produce, if not
                    heavy, is generally of very good quality. Soils which are naturally wet and
                    heavy, as well as those which are heavily manured, such as old garden ground,
                    are not suitable. Indeed it is best, except when there is ample space, to grow
                    only the earlier kinds in gardens. If the soil is of fair quality, the less
                    manure used upon it the better, unless it be. soot or lime. Gypsum, bone-dust,
                    superphosphate of lime, and nitrate of soda may also be used, and wood ashes are
                    advantageous if the soil contains much vegetable matter.</p>
                <p>Potatoes are commonly propagated by dividing the tubers, leaving to each segment
                    or “set” one or two eyes or buds. The ‘ ‘ sets” are then planted by the aid of
                    the dibble or spade, in rows at a distance varying from 15 inches to 3 feet, the
                    distance being regulated by the height of the stems, and that between the sets
                    varying from 6 to 12 inches, 8 inches being a good average space for garden
                    crops, with 2 feet between the rows. The sets may be put in 6 inches deep. The
                    late T. A. Knight suggested the planting of whole tubers or sets, at greater
                    distances apart, by which means, he argued, a larger produce would be obtained;
                    he proposed to leave 4 feet between the rows, but that distance, except with the
                    larger varieties, has been found to be too great. Though the planting of whole
                    tubers instead of the cut sets has been thus highly recommended, yet according
                    to some experiments made in the garden of the Horticultural Society at Chiswick
                    the cut sets yield a much better return than whole ones. The full-sized tubers
                    are, however, preferable to smaller ones, as their larger buds tend to produce
                    stronger shoots. It has also been found that the best returns are obtained from
                    sets taken from the points of the tubers—not from their base. Mr Thomas Dickson
                    of Edinburgh long ago observed that the most healthy and productive crop was to
                    be obtained by planting unripe tubers, and proposed this as a preventive of the
                    disease called the “curl,” which sometimes attacks the young stems, causing them
                    and also the leaves to become crumpled, and few or no tubers to be produced. It
                    has also been noted that the sprouting of the eyes of the potato may be
                    accelerated if, while still unripe, it is taken up and exposed for some weeks to
                    the influence of a scorching sun. The best sets are those obtained from plants
                    grown in elevated and open situations, and it is also beneficial to use sets
                    grown on a different soil.</p>
                <p>The earliest crops should, if possible, be planted in a light soil and in a warm
                    situation, towards the end of February, or as early as possible in March. In
                    some cases the tubers for early crops are sprouted on a hotbed, the plants being
                    put out as soon as the leaves can bear exposure. If the young sprouts are about
                    2 inches long, they may be planted out towards the end of March; if they are
                    protected young potatoes will be procured in seven or eight weeks. It will
                    improve the crop if, when the stems have grown a few inches above ground, the
                    earth is drawn up to them, but the operation will delay its maturity for two or
                    three weeks. Mr Knight recommends removing the flowers as they appear, in order
                    to increase the produce. The fine early varieties, however, scarcely produce any
                    flowers.</p>
                <p>The main crop should be planted by the middle of March, late planting being very
                    undesirable. Those intended for storing should be dug up as soon as they are
                    fairly ripe, unless they are attacked by the dire disease, in which case they
                    must be taken up as soon as the murrain is observed; or if they are then
                    sufficiently developed to be worth preserving, but not fully ripe, the haulms or
                    shaws should be pulled out, to prevent the virus passing down them into the
                    tubers; this may be done without disturbing the tubers, which can be dug
                    afterwards. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> vol. i. p. 364.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The best forcing sorts are. the Ash-leaf as a
                    kidney, and the Early Market or Rector of Woodstock for around. The earliest
                    crop may be planted in December, and successional ones in January and February.
                    The mode of cultivation adopted by the London market gardeners is thus in
                    substance explained by Mr Cuthill. A long trench, 5 feet wide and 2 feet deep,
                    is filled with hot dung, on which soil to the depth of 6 inches is put. The sets
                    employed are middle-sized whole potatoes, which are placed close together over
                    the bed, covered with 2 inches of mould, and then hooped and protected with mats
                    and straw, under which conditions they will sprout in about a month. A bed of
                    the requisite length (sometimes 100 yards) is then prepared of about 2 feet
                    thickness of hot dung, soil is put on to the depth of 8 inches, and the frames
                    set over all. The potatoes are then carefully taken up from the striking bed,
                    all the shoots being removed except the main one, and they are planted 4 inches
                    deep, radishes being sown thinly over them ana covered lightly with mould. When
                    the haulm of the potato has grown to about 6 inches in height, the points are
                    nipped off, in order to give the radishes fair play; and, although this may stop
                    growth for a few days, still the potato crop is always excellent. After planting
                    nothing more is required but to keep up the temperature to about 70°, admitting
                    air when practicable, and giving water as required. The crop is not dug up until
                    it has come to maturity.</p>
                <p>Potatoes are also grown largely in hooped beds on a warm border in the open
                    ground. The sets after having been sprouted, as above, are planted out in
                    January in trenches 2 feet deep filled with hot dung, the sets being planted 5
                    inches deep, and over all radishes are sown. The ridges are then hooped over,
                    allowing about 2 feet of space in the middle, between the mould and the hoop,
                    and are covered with mats and straw, but as soon as the radishes come up they
                    are uncovered daily, and covered again every night as a protection against
                    possible frosts. This is continued till the potatoes are ready for digging in
                    May.</p>
                <p>Potatoes are sometimes grown in pots in heat, sprouted sets being planted in
                    11-inch pots about two-thirds full of soil, and placed near the glass in any of
                    the forcing-houses, where a temperature of from 65° to 70° is to be maintained.
                    The plants are duly watered and earthed up as they advance in growth.</p>
                <p>Small supplies of young waxy tubers are produced during winter, in boxes placed
                    in a mushroom-house or in a common cellar. If in October old seed tubers are
                    placed in layers, alternately with a mixture of tree leaves and light mould, the
                    young tubers before midwinter will often attain the size and appearance of early
                    potatoes; they are, however, watery, and possess little flavour.</p>
                <p>The varieties of the potato are very numerous, and much attention has been paid
                    during the last few years to the production of new and improved kinds. The
                    following are named as a limited selection of a few of the standard sorts in the
                    several groups, those marked * having coloured skins, the rest being white:—</p>

                    annual, un- ] known in the wild state. Some varieties of our wild radish, R.
                    Raphanistrum, however, met with on the Mediterranean coasts, come so near to it
                    as to suggest that it may possibly be a cultivated race of the same species. It
                    is very popular as a raw salad. There are two principal forms, the
                    spindle-rooted and the turnip-rooted.</p>
                <p>The radish succeeds in any well-worked not too heavy garden soil, but requires a
                    warm sheltered situation. The seed is generally sown broadcast, in beds 4 to 5
                    feet wide, with alleys between, the beds requiring to be netted over to protect
                    them from birds. The earliest crop may be sown about the middle of December, the

                    there is no frost. If the crop succeeds, which depends on the state of the
                    weather, it will be in use about the beginning of March. Another sowing may be
                    made in January, a third early in February, if the season is a favourable one,
                    and still another towards the end of February, from which time till October a
                    small sowing should be made every fortnight or three weeks in spring, and rather
                    more frequently during summer. About the end of October, and again in November,
                    a late sowing may be màde on a south border or bank, the plants being protected
                    in severe weather with litter or mats. The winter radishes, which grow to a
                    large size, should be sown in the beginning of July and in August, in drills
                    from 6 to 9 inches apart, the plants being thinned out to 5 or 6 inches in the
                    row. The roots become fit for use during the autumn. For winter use they should
                    be taken up before severe frost sets in, and stored in dry sand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> To obtain early radishes a sowing should be made
                    about the beginning of November, and continued fortnightly till the middle or
                    end of February; the crop will generally be fit for use about six weeks after
                    sowing. The seed should be sown in light rich soil, 8 or 9 inches thick, on a
                    moderate hotbed, or in a pit with a temperature of from 55° to 65°. Gentle
                    waterings must be given, and air admitted at every favourable opportunity; but
                    the sashes must be protected at night and in frosty weather with straw mats or
                    other materials. Some of these crops are often grown with forced potatoes. The
                    best forcing sorts are Wood’s Early Frame, and the Early Rose Globe, Early
                    Dwarf-top Scarlet Turnip, and Early Dwarf-top White Turnip.</p>
                <p>Those best suited for general cultivation are the following :—</p>

                    biennial, native or naturalized in the south of England, and found on banks and
                    in pastures in central and southern Europe, extending to the Caucasus. The white
                    fleshy roots, known as “ramps,” are used raw as a salad, or boiled like
                    asparagus. It is but little cultivated in England. The seed, which is very
                    minute, and should be mixed with sand before sowing to secure even distribution,
                    is sown in drills 6 to 8 inches apart, about the end of ’ May or beginning of
                    June, in deeply worked ground, and in a cool situation, and the young plants are
                    merely to be thinned and kept clear of weeds. The roots, which somewhat resemble
                    small radishes, will be fit for use about November, and on the approach of
                    frost, if taken up and stored in sand, they will keep fresh and firm till
                    spring.</p>
                <p>183. The <hi rend="italic">Rhubarb</hi> of gardens is derived from different
                    species of Rheum, especially R. Rhaponticum and R. undulatum. The parts chiefly
                    utilized are the fleshy foot-stalks of the leaves, which are much used for
                    preserves, puddings, and tarts, as well as for stewing.</p>
                <p>Rhubarb requires an open situation and a rich deep soil, which should be well
                    manured, and prepared by deep trenching. To form a plantation, divisions of the
                    old roots, each provided with a bud or crown, should be put in early in spring,
                    the crown being set about 2 inches below the surface. They should stand 3 to 4
                    feet apart each way, according to the habit of the variety. The plants will
                    afford a supply in the following spring. It is desirable to renew the plantation
                    in the course of four or five years, shifting to new ground. When gathering the
                    crop, the leaf-stalks should be bent downwards, and pulled off sideways, not
                    cut. The flower-stems should be cut off as soon as they make their appearance,
                    in order to strengthen the root. Established sorts must be increased by
                    division, as seedlings do not reproduce the variety. Rhubarb may, however, be
                    grown from seeds—a flower stem or two being allowed to grow up for the purpose
                    of producing them. The seeds should be sown on a slight hotbed in spring, and
                    transplanted out in rows in the month of May, no stalks being gathered from them
                    for the first two years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> Rhubarb may be forced in a variety of ways for
                    early or winter use; it may have a pot or box set over the crown »nd covered up
                    by warm litter, dung, or leaves like sea-kale; or the roots may be taken up,
                    potted, and set into any forcing-house at work, the crowns being kept in the
                    dark so as to blanch the stalks; or they may be planted closely in long narrow
                    boxes of moderate depth, and set in a mushroom-house or cellar, where there is a
                    considerable temperature. The rhubarb will soon throw up its stalks, and these,
                    being partially etiolated, possess a delicacy and flavour superior to those
                    grown in the open air. It is easy, by varying the time of subjecting the boxes
                    to the increased temperature, to keep up a succession of rhubarb stalks, from
                    the period at which kitchen apples become scarce or begin to lose their flavour,
                    till green gooseberries come into season.</p>
                <p>The favourite old sorts of rhubarb were the Tobolsk and the Elford or Buck’s; the
                    latter comes from R. undulatum, and is one of the best in flavour, ' <hi

                    good sorts of more modern date are Mitchell s Royal Albert, Dancer’s Early
                    Scarlet, Myatt's Linnaeus, and Myatt's Victoria, the last a large-growing
                    thick-stalked kind, the others being all earlier sorts. Johnson's St Martin’s
                    and Salt’s Crimson Perfection are also favourite kinds; and Stott's Monarch
                    grows to a very large size.</p>
                <p>184. The <hi rend="italic">Rocambole,</hi> Allium Scorodoprasum, is a hardy
                    bulbous perennial, occurring in a wild state in sandy pastures and waste places
                    throughout Europe, but not common in the south; in Britain it is found chiefly
                    in the north of England and the south of Scotland. The plant is grown for the
                    sake of its bulbs, which are smaller and milder than those of garlic, and
                    consist of several cloves chiefly produced at the roots. The cloves should be
                    planted about the end of February or in March, and treated like the garlic or
                    shallot. When mature, the bulbs should be taken up. dried, and stored for
                    use.</p>
                <p>185. The <hi rend="italic">Salsafy</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Salsify},</hi>
                    Tragopogon porrifolius, is a hardy biennial, with long cylindrical fleshy
                    esculent roots, which, when properly cooked, are extremely delicate and
                    wholesome; it occurs in meadows and pastures in the Mediterranean region, and,
                    in Britain, is confined to the south of England. The salsafy requires a free
                    rich deep soil, which should be trenched in autumn, the manure used being placed
                    at two spades’ depth from the surface. The first crop should be sown in March,
                    and the main crop in April, in rows a foot from each other, the plants being
                    afterwards thinned to 8 inches apart. In November the whitish roots should be
                    taken up and stored in sand for immediate use, others being secured in a similar
                    way during intervals of mild weather.</p>
                <p>186. The <hi rend="italic">Savoy,</hi> Brassica oleracea bullata major, is a near
                    ally of the cabbage, but .has bullate or blistered leaves; it is more hardy,
                    and, except in very severe Seasons, instead of suffering is rather improved in
                    flavour by frost. The savoys come into use in autumn, and continue until the
                    spring. The early crop should be sown in February, the main crop about the
                    middle of March, and a month afterwards the latest crop. The rows of the smaller
                    sorts,should be 15 inches, and those of the larger ones 2 feet, apart.</p>
                <p>The best sorts of savoys for garden culture are :—</p>
                <p>Tours, early and hardy; Ulm, early, but not so hardy; Little Pixie, small, early,
                    and good; Dwarf Green Curled, best for a general crop; Golden, handsome and
                    excellent. The large Drumhead savoy is more suitable for field culture, unless
                    bulk of produce is required.</p>
                <p>187. The <hi rend="italic">Scorzonera,</hi> Scorzonera hispanica, is a hardy
                    perennial, a native of Spain, but cultivated in gardens for its fleshy
                    cylindrical roots, which resemble those of salsafy except in being black
                    outside, and which are used in the same manner. They should be treated in every
                    respect like salsafy (par. 185).</p>
                <p>188. The <hi rend="italic">Sea-kale,</hi> Crambe maritima, is a hardy perennial,
                    growing spontaneously along the coasts of England, of Ireland, and of the Scotch
                    lowlands, along the western coasts of Europe, and on the Baltic, reappearing on
                    the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>Sea-kale prefers a light dry soil, and when manure is necessary it should consist
                    of sea-weed or well-rotted dung; or a dressing of salt or of nitrate of soda may
                    be given. When it is raised from seeds, they should be sown in March or April in
                    rows a foot asunder, the plants being thinned to 6 inches apart. In the
                    following March these should be planted out in trenched well-prepared ground, 2
                    feet asunder, in rows 2⅛ to 3 feet apart. The top with the crown buds should be
                    cut off before planting to prevent them from running up to seed. In the spring
                    of the second year the young shoots if blanched will be fit for use, and
                    therefore the summer growth should in every way be promoted by the use of water
                    and liquid manure. Tolerably blanched stalks may be produced by plants only nine
                    months old from the seed, and after two summers seedling plants will have
                    acquired sufficient strength for general cropping. The seeds, instead of being
                    sown in rows and transplanted, may be deposited in patches of three or four
                    together, where they are to remain. In the autumn, after the leaves have been
                    cleared off, the ground should be forked up, and 6 or 8 inches’ depth of leaves
                    or of light sandy soil laid over the plants, by either of which means they will
                    be blanched, though not forced. The blanched sprouts should be cut for use
                    whilst they are crisp, compact, and from 3 to 6 inches in length, the stem being
                    cut quite down to the base.</p>
                <p>Sea-kale beds may be made equally well from cuttings of the roots, the
                    extremities of the roots, technically called “thongs,” being the parts best
                    adapted for this purpose. They should be taken up in autumn, cut into lengths of
                    about 4 inches, and laid aside in a heap of sand or earth till spring, when they
                    should be planted out like the seedlings. Cuttings should not be taken from any
                    but very healthy plants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Sea-kale may be forced in
                    the open beds by the aid of sea-kale pots or covers, which are large enough to
                    cover a plant, contracted a little at top, with a movable lid or cover. In the
                    autumn the stalks are cut over, the decayed leaves removed, the ground loosened
                    about the eyes, and a thin stratum of coal-ashes mixed with salt laid on the
                    surface to keep down earth-worms. One of the earthenware pots or covers, or
                    failing these a large inverted flower-pot, is placed over each plant or each
                    patch of plants, and <pb break="no"

                    pots, and raised to about a foot above them. When fermentation commences, a
                    thermometer should be occasionally introduced into a few of the pots, to
                    ascertain that the temperature within does not exceed 60° Fahr., and the
                    thickness of the leaves is to be regulated accordingly. In a month or six weeks
                    the shoots will be ready for cutting, and by means of the movable lids they can
                    be examined and the shoots gathered without materially disturbing the covering.
                    If the crowns are thus covered up by about the end of October, the crop may be
                    cut by about the third week of December, and by starting a batch at various
                    times a supply may be kept up till the middle of May.</p>
                <p>Strong plants may also be taken up and planted on hotbeds, the sashes being kept
                    covered close; or they may be set thickly in boxes as recommended for rhubarb
                    (par. 183), and placed in any heated structure, or in the mushroom house; but,
                    to have the shoots crisp and tender as well as blanched, light must be
                    completely excluded. Besides the common purple-leaved, there is a green-leaved
                    sort, which is said to blanch better.</p>
                <p>189. <hi rend="italic">The Shallot,</hi> Allium ascalonicum, is a native of
                    Palestine, and is much used in cookery for high-flavoured soups and gravies,
                    besides which it is excellent when pickled. It is a hardy bulbous perennial, and
                    is propagated by offsets, which are often planted in September or October, but
                    the principal crop should not be got in earlier than February or the beginning
                    of March. The mixing of soot with the manure has been recommended as a
                    protection against maggots. In planting, the tops of the bulbs should be kept a
                    little above ground, and it is a commendable plan to draw away the soil
                    surrounding the bulbs when they have got root-hold. They should not be planted
                    on ground recently manured. They require the same general treatment as garlic
                    and rocambole, and should be stored in a similar manner. They come to maturity
                    about July or August. There are two sorts—the Common, and the Jersey or Russian,
                    the latter being much larger and less pungent.</p>

                    perennial, native of China and Japan, the roots of which are boiled, and
                    afterwards served up like salsafy. It requires a free, deep, and much enriched
                    soil, and is generally raised from seeds, which should be sown in drills a foot
                    apart about the end of March, the bed being well-watered in dry weather. The
                    roots will be in use about November, and will continue fresh through the winter
                    if carefully stored.</p>

                    found throughout Europe, in Asiatic Russia, and in North America. The leaves are
                    used, more so on the Continent than in Britain, in soups, salads, and sauces.
                    Sorrel grows freely in any good garden soil, and is increased by dividing the
                    roots during the early part of spring. They should be planted in rows 15 to 18
                    inches apart. The leaves, when fully grown, are gathered singly.</p>
                <p>The common garden sorrel is much superior to the wild plant; but the Belleville,
                    which is the kind generally cultivated near Paris, is still better, its leaves
                    being larger and not so acid. The Blistered-leaved, which has large leaves with
                    a blistered surface, has the advantage of being slow in running to seed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">French Sorrel,</hi> Rumex scutatus, is a hardy perennial,
                    native of France and Switzerland, with densely-branched trailing stems. The

                    the common sorrel.</p>
                <p>192. The <hi rend="italic">Spinach,</hi> Spinacia oleracea, is an annual plant,
                    which has been long cultivated for the sake of its succulent leaves. It should
                    be grown on good ground, well -worked and well manured; and for the summer crops
                    abundant watering will be necessary.</p>
                <p>The first sowing of winter spinach should be made early in August, and another
                    towards the end of that month, in some sheltered but not shaded situation, in
                    rows 18 inches apart,—the plants, as they advance, being thinned, and the ground
                    hoed. By the beginning of winter the outer leaves will have become fit for use,
                    and if the weather is mild successive gatherings may be obtained up to the
                    beginning of May. The Prickly-seeded and the Flanders are the best for winter;
                    and these should be thinned out early in the autumn to about 2 inches apart, and
                    later on to 6 inches. The Lettuce-leaved is a good succulent winter sort, but
                    not quite so hardy.</p>
                <p>To afford a succession of summer spinach, the seeds should be sown about the
                    middle of February, and again in March; after this period small quantities
                    should be sown once a fortnight, as summer spinach lasts but a very short time.
                    They are generally sown in shallow drills between the lines of peas. If a plot
                    of ground has to be wholly occupied, the rows should be about a foot apart. The
                    Roundleaved is the best sort for summer use.</p>
                <p>193. The <hi rend="italic">Tomato</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Love Apple,</hi>
                    Lycopersicum esculentum or Solanum Lycopersicum, is a tender annual from South
                    America, much esteemed in England as an esculent, either raw or cooked.</p>
                <p>Tomatoes were formerly raised from seed sown in gentle heat in February or eaYly
                    in March, potted singly into small pots, shifted on into larger pots, and
                    gradually exposed to the air till about the end of May, when, if the season was
                    favourable, they were planted out against a wall with a south aspect, or in the
                    warmest situation at command. As they grew, they were nailed to the wall, or
                    otherwise supported. Only the earlier of the fruit ripened qut of doors in an
                    average season; and when a fair quantity had set, the plants were stopped, the
                    secondary branches being also stopped above the fruit, and laterals, removed
                    gradually. Under these circumstances the fruit began to ripen in August,
                    successively coming to maturity, at which stage, and λvhen perfectly dry, it had
                    to be gathered and hung up or laid on shelves. The partially ripened fruit had
                    to be got in before it was injured by frost, its maturation being completed in a
                    vinery or other heated house, and, though not acquiring the full flavour, the
                    forwardest of these late fruits thus became usable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The outdoor treatment remains as above sketched
                    out, but, owing to the precarious nature of the crop in bad seasons, large
                    quantities are now grown under glass. Mr G. T. Miles, of Wycombe Abbey Gardens,
                    has explained in the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners Chronicle</hi> his mode of
                    culture, of which the following is an abstract:—</p>
                <p>“To grow it properly, it requires considerable heat and every possible ray of
                    sunshine, as well as a free circulation of dry warm air. The compost should
                    consist of about one-half rough turfy loam, one-fourth of roadside scrapings,
                    and one-fourth of decomposed manure or horse-droppings, moderately fresh. For
                    planting out, a ridge of soil 2 feet wide and 15 inches deep should be placed on
                    a warm bed of tan or leaves. For pot cultivation those from 12 to 15 inches in
                    diameter are most appropriate, and these should not be quite filled, in order
                    that surface dressings of the same material or of pure manure may be applied
                    afterwards. For early work a solving should be made in January, and the plants
                    moved onwards until they have moderately filled 5-inch pots with roots, when
                    they are transferred to the bedsorfruiting-pots; in each case the plants are
                    kept about 2 feet apart. Other sowings may be made at intervals till about the
                    end of August. From the last sowing a supply is obtained for a considerable
                    period onwards through the winter months. The plants are restricted to one main
                    stem, which is allowed a run of 6 feet or more, as the position may admit, and
                    from this all laterals are removed in an early stage of growth. Top-dressings of
                    rich materials should be applied when the surface soil becomes full of roots;
                    copious supplies of stimulating manure-water are also necessary, and the fruits
                    should be kept perfectly free from damp while they are ripening. For this
                    purpose, if close confined pits are used, a chink of air should be kept on
                    continuously.”</p>
                <p>Tomatoes may also be allowed to run freely over the back wall of a forcing house,
                    and, if sufficiently fed, will bear fruit abundantly.</p>
                <p>Mr Miles observes that these plants, when grown out of doors, are generally
                    placed in an excellent position, but the main point—the enrichment of the
                    soil—is overlooked or not sufficiently attended to. A portion of good soil
                    should be provided for each plant, and heavy mulchings of manure should be
                    placed upon the surface as soon as practicable after planting, in order to
                    prevent the soil becoming dry and parched. In these cases three or more main
                    shoots are allowed to each plant, because it often happens that the space will
                    not allow a good run, and a certain amount of growth with foliage is essential
                    to the well-doing of the plants.</p>
                <p>The following varieties afford considerable choice :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Red-fruited:</hi> Early Gem, small, but a good cropper, and the
                    quickest to ripen; Vick’s Criterion, small and free-bearing, particularly
                    adapted for growing in small pots; Vilmorin's Dwarf Early, dwarf and
                    free-bearing; Hathaway’s Excelsior, one of the finest, a great cropper; Trophy,
                    large and very fine; Conqueror, large and prolific.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Yellow-fruited:</hi> Carter’s Green Gage, of a distinct yellow
                    colour, and of fine flavour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Smaller-fruited:</hi> Cherry Red and Burghley Bet, round,
                    prolific, and agreeably flavoured; Dickson’s Queen of Tomatoes, with
                    pear-shaped, and Nesbit’s Victoria, with plum-shaped fruits, both being prolific
                    sorts.</p>
                <p>194. The <hi rend="italic">Turnip,</hi> Brassica campestris Rapa, is a harüy
                    biennial, found in corn-fields in various parts of England. The cultivated
                    varieties have bulbiform roots, much esteemed as an esculent.</p>
                <p>Turnips should be grown in a rich friable sandy loam, such as will produce
                    medium-sized roots without much aid from the manure heap, and are better
                    flavoured if grown in fresh soil. In light dry soils well decomposed hotbed or
                    farmyard manure is the best that can be used, but in soils containing an excess
                    of organic matter, bone dust, superphosphate of lime, wood-ashes, or guano,
                    mixed with light soil, and laid in the drills before sowing the seed, are
                    beneficial by stimulating the young plants to get quickly into rough leaf, and
                    thus to grow out of reach of the so-called turnip fly. To get rid of this pest,
                    it has been found beneficial to dust the plants with quicklime, and also to draw
                    over the young plants nets smeared with some sticky substance like treacle, by
                    which large numbers will be caught and destroyed. It has been also recommended
                    as a palliative to sow thick in order to allow for a percentage of loss from
                    this and other causes, and, as a preventive, to scatter gas-lime over
                    the.surface after the seed has been sown. Mr Thompson <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gardeners’ Assistant)</hi> also recommends the following remedy:— ‘ ‘ In the
                    first place, let a supply of water be brought close to hand, or say to each end
                    of the quarter; then let one person move steadily along one side of the piece of
                    ground from one end to the other, delivering the water through a rose as he
                    proceeds. The fleas will jump forward as the water approaches them, and a second
                    person, following the first, will keep them on the-hop forward, whilst a third
                    will drive them still further, and so on till the whole are driven off the
                    ground.”</p>
                <p>The first sowing should be made on a warm border with the protection of a frame
                    or matted hoops, in January or February, the second on a well-sheltered border
                    in March, after which a sowing once a month will generally suffice. In May and
                    June the plot should be in a cool moderately shaded position, lest the plants
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n300/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0300-0289"/> should suffer from drought. The principal autumn
                    and winter sowings, which are the most important, should be made about the end
                    of June in the northern districts, and in the beginning of July in warmer
                    districts; a small sowing may be madeat the end of August to come in before the
                    spring-sown crops are ready. If the weather is showery at the time of sowing,
                    the seed speedily germinates, and the young plants should be kept growing
                    quickly by watering with rain or pond water and by surface stirrings. The drills
                    for the earliest sorts need not be more than 15 inches apart, and the plants may
                    be left moderately thick in the row; the late crops should have at least 2 feet
                    between the rows, and be thinned to 12 inches in the row, a free circulation of
                    air about them being very important in winter. As a provision against prolonged
                    periods of severe weather, it has been recommended to lay the finest roots in
                    rows, covering them well with soil, and leaving intact the whole of the foliage.
                    The very latest sown crops of half-grown roots will prolong the supply until the
                    earliest spring-sown crops are fit for use.</p>
                <p>The following are the best sorts of turnips for garden crops</p>
                <p>Early Purple-top Munich, the earliest and best of all; Early White Strapleaf,
                    very quick growing, and good; Early Snowball, for summer use; Early White Stone,
                    for summer sowing; Orange Jelly, for summer sowing; Yellow Finland, for winter
                    use; Chirk Castle, for winter use. In addition to these, which have round roots,
                    there are the Jersey Navet, an excellent oblong variety, and very hardy, and the
                    Teltow, a small tapering-rooted sort, employed, on account of its piquant
                    flavour, in ragouts, and for seasoning. The latter should be sown in April and
                    July in sandy soil.</p>
                <p>195. The <hi rend="italic">Water Cress,</hi> Nasturtium officinale, is a hardy
                    perennial, occurring wild in Britain, and also throughout Europe and Asiatic
                    Russia, except the extreme north. It is highly prized as a salad, and accredited
                    with powerful antiscorbutic properties. It may be propagated from seed, but in
                    forming plantations rooted divisions are usually employed. They should occupy
                    positions where they can be supplied with water from a spring, as this will be
                    rarely frozen. The plant Will not grow freely on a muddy bottom; hence this has
                    to be replaced by gravel or chalk. A constant current of water is absolutely
                    necessary; and the plants should be disposed in rows parallel with the course of
                    the stream. They thrive best in water about 1⅜ inch in depth; this increases to
                    about 3 inches when the plants begin to grow, and thereby check the current. In
                    summer the tops of the plants must be kept closely cut, and under proper
                    conditions of water and soil they will yield a gathering once a week. In winter
                    the water should be 4 to 5 inches deep, to obtain which the plants are left with
                    more head. The time for the renewal of the beds is in May and June, and from
                    September to November, the planting being done in succession; those planted in
                    May are fit to cut by August, and those planted in November are ready to gather
                    in the spring. When collected for sale, the shoots are cut, not broken off, the
                    latter plan being injurious. The water cress may also be grown in a shady border
                    of rich light soil, kept constantly moist; but the surface should be covered
                    with a thin layer of sand to keep the leaves clean. It may be also grown in tubs
                    partially filled with soil which is covered with water, in which case the water
                    should be frequently changed, or in shallow pans set in stands of water. If
                    protected from frost in a brick pit with a slight service of hot-water piping,
                    it may be had in use through the winter. To secure this, pans are filled with
                    loamy soil in October or November, and planted with the tops of outdoor cresses;
                    in about six weeks they will be fit to cut, and will furnish successional
                    gatherings.</p>
                <p>196. The <hi rend="italic">Chinese Yam,</hi> Dioscorea Batatas, is a
                    fleshy-rooted perennial climber, native of China. It has annual stems, and
                    deeply penetrating thick club-shaped fleshy roots, or rhizomes, full of starch,
                    which when cooked acquire a mild taste like that of a potato, but have besides
                    somewhat of a medicinal flavour. The roots gι ’ ow 3 feet or upwards in length,
                    and sometimes acquire a weight of more than 1⅜ lb. The plant grows freely enough
                    in deep sandy soil, moderately enriched. The sets, consisting of pieces of the
                    roots, may be planted in March or April, and require no other culture than the
                    staking of the climbing stems. They should not be dug up before November, the
                    chief increase in their size taking place in autumn. They sometimes strike
                    downwards 2 or 3 feet into the soil, and must be carefully dug out, the upper
                    slender part being reserved for propagation, ana the lower fleshy portion eaten
                    after having been allowed a few days to dry.</p>
                <p>197. <hi rend="smallcaps">Culinary Herbs.</hi> —Besides the foregoing esculent
                    and salad plants, there are several minor herbs used for flavouring and
                    garnisning. For the most part they are dwarf perennial plants requiring to be
                    grown on a dry warm soil in an open sunny aspect, or annuals for which a warm
                    sheltered border is the most suitable place; and they may therefore be
                    conveniently grown together in the same compartment—an herb garden. The
                    perennials should be transplanted either every year or every second year.</p>
                <p>For winter use the tops of the most useful kinds of herbs should be cut when in
                    flower or full leaf and quite dry, and spread out in an airy but shady place so
                    as to part slowly with the moisture they contain, and at the same time retain
                    their aromatic properties. When quite dry they should be put into dry
                    widemouthed bottles and kept closely corked. In this way such herbs as basil,
                    marjoram, mint, sage, savory, and thyme of the aromatic class, balm, chamomile,
                    horehound, hyssop, and rue of the medicinal class, as well as parsley, may be
                    had throughout the season with almost the full flavour of the fresh herb.</p>

                    Greenhouse.—</hi> Little is to be done in either. In the greenhouse care must be
                    used to protect against frost. Ventilate but little, and with care; raise the
                    ventilating sash only high enough to let the heated air from the greenhouse
                    drive back the outer air so as not to chill the plants. To destroy the red
                    spider, syringe the plants copiously at night, and splash the paths with water.
                    The aphis, or “green fly,” must also be destroyed; tobacco may be used. At this
                    season rosés, grape vines, and other plants are often affected by mildew; an
                    effectual remedy is to paint the hot-water pipes with a mixture of sulphur and
                    lime, put on as thick as ordinary whitewash, once each week until it is checked;
                    but care must be taken not to apply it on any surface at a higher temperature
                    than 212°. Hyacinths and other bulbs that have been kept in a cellar or other
                    dark cool place may now be brought* into the light of the greenhouse or sitting
                    room, provided they have filled the pots with roots. If they are not well
                    rooted, leave them until they are, or select such of them as are best, leaving
                    the others. In the outside flower garden little can be done except that shrubs
                    may be pruned, or new work, such as making walks or grading, performed, if
                    weather permits.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fruit Garden.—</hi> Bruning, staking
                    up, or mulching can be done if the weather is such that the workmen can stand
                    out. No plant is injured by being pruned in cold weather.</p><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Grapery.—</hi> Graperies used for the forcing of foreign grapes
                    may be started, beginning at a temperature of 50° at night, with 10° or 15°
                    higher during the day. The borders must be covered sufficiently deep with leaves
                    or manure to prevent the soil from freezing, as it would be destruction to the
                    vines to start the shoots if the roots were frozen; hence, when forcing is begun
                    in January, the covering should be put on in November, before severe frosts
                    begin.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Garden.—</hi> But little can be done in
                    the Northern States except to prepare manure, and get sashes, tools, &lt;fcc.,
                    in working order; but in Sections of the country where there is little or no
                    frost the hardier kinds of seeds and plants may be sown and planted, such as
                    asparagus, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, leek, lettuce, onion, parsnip, peas,
                    spinach, turnip, &lt;fcc. In any section where these seeds can be sown in open
                    ground, it is an indication that hotbeds may be started for the sowing of such
                    tender vegetables as tomatoes, egg and pepper plants, &amp;c.; though, unless in
                    the extreme Southern States, hotbeds should not be started before the beginning
                    or middle of February.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">February.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Flower Garden and Greenhouse.—</hi> The directions for January
                    will in the main apply to this month, except that now some of the hardier
                    annuals may be sown in hotbed or greenhouse, and also the propagation of plants
                    by cuttings may be done rather better now than in January, as the greater amount
                    of light gives more vitality to the cutting.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fruit
                    Garden.—</hi> But little can be done in most of the Northern States as yet, and
                    in sections where there is no frost in the ground, it is likely to be too wet to
                    work; but in many Southern States this will be the best month for planting fruit
                    trees and plants of all kinds, particularly strawberries, raspberries,
                    blackberries, pear and apple trees, while grape vines will do, though they will
                    also do well quite a month later.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Grapery.—</hi> The
                    graperies started last month at 50° at night may now be increased to 60°, with a
                    correspondingly higher day temperature. Great care must be taken to syringe the
                    leaves thoroughly at least once a day, and to deluge the paths with water, so as
                    to produce a moist atmosphere. Paint the hot-water pipes with sulphur mixture,
                    as recommended in January.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Garden.—</hi>
                    Leaves from the woods, house manure, or refuse hops from breweries may be got
                    together towards the latter part of this month, and mixed and turned to get
                    “sweetened” preparatory to forming hotbeds. Cabbage, lettuce, and cauliflower
                    seeds, if sown early this month in hotbed or greenhouse, will make fine plants
                    if transplanted into hotbed in March. This is preferable to the use of fall-sown
                    plants. Manure that is to be used for the crop should be broken up as fine as
                    possible, for the more completely manure of any kind can be mixed with the soil
                    the better the crop will be, and, of course, if it is dug or ploughed in in
                    large unbroken lumps it cannot be properly commingled.</p><p><hi

                    that are likely to be wanted should be continued. Hardier kinds of annuals may
                    be sown; it is best done in shallow boxes, say 2 inches deep. Lawns can be raked
                    off and mulched with short manure, or rich garden earth where manure cannot be
                    obtained. Flower beds on light soils may be dug up so as to forward the work of
                    the coming busy spring season.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fruit Garden.—In</hi>
                    many sections, planting may now be done with safety, provided the soil is light
                    and dry, but not otherwise. Again at this season, although a tree or plant will
                    receive no injury when its roots are undisturbed in the soil should a frost come
                    after planting, the same amount of freezing will and very often does greatly
                    injure the plant if the roots are exposed.</p><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Grapery.—</hi> The grapery started in January will have set its fruit, which
                    should be thinned by one-third. The temperature may now be farther advanced to
                    70° at night, with 15° higher in the daytime. The same precautions must be used
                    against mildew and insects as given in January. Graperies wanted for succession
                    may be started in February or this month.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable

                    while for most of the Southern States tender vegetables, such as egg plant,
                    okra, sweet potatoes, melon, squash, potatoes tomatoes, &lt;fcc., may be sown

                    greenhouse plants require more water and ventilation. Due attention must be paid
                    to shifting well-rooted plants into larger pots; and, if space is desired, many
                    kinds of hardier plants can be safely put out in cold frames. Towards the end of
                    the month it may be necessary to slightly shade the glass of the greenhouse. All
                    herbaceous plants and hardy shrubs may be planted in the garden. The covering of
                    leaves or litter should be taken off bulbs and tender plants that were covered
                    up for winter, so that the beds can be lightly forked and raked. Sow tender

                    Strawberries that have been covered up with straw or leaves should be relieved

                    &lt;fcc., that have been laid down, may now be uncovered and tied up to stakes
                    or trellises, and all new plantations of these and other fruits may now be

                    Asparagus, rhubarb, spinach, &lt;tc., should be uncovered, and the beds hoed or

                    cabbage, cauliflower, celery, lettuce, onions, parsley, parsnip, peas, potatoes,
                    radishes, spinach, turnip, &lt;fcc., should all be sown or planted by the middle

                    before the end of the month. It is essential, in sowing seeds now, that they be
                    well firmed in the soil. Any who expect to get early cabbage, cauliflower,
                    lettuce, or radishes, while planting or sowing is delayed until the time of
                    sowing tomato and egg plant in May, are sure to be disappointed of a full
                    crop.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">May.</hi><hi rend="italic">Flower Garden and

                    still be exercised in ventilating. Every precaution must be used to keep the air
                    moist. “Moss culture” may be tried, the common sphagnum or moss of the swamps,
                    mixed with one-twentieth of its bulk of bone-dust, being laid as a mulch on the
                    top of the earth of the flower-pots; its effect is to shield the pots from the
                    sun, and at the same time stimulate the roots to come to the surface. By the end
                    of the month all of the plants that are wanted for the summer decoration of the
                    flower border may be planted out, first loosening a little the ball of earth at
                    the roots. If the weather is dry, water freely after planting. When the
                    greenhouse is not to be used during the summer months, camellias, azaleas, and
                    plants of that character should be set out of doors under partial shade; but
                    most of the other plants usually grown in the conservatory or window garden in
                    winter may be set in the open border. Flower beds should be kept well hoed and
                    raked, to prevent the growth of weeds next month. Laλvns should be mown, and the
                    edgings trimmed. Pelargoniums, pinks, monthly roses, and all the half
                    hardy-kinds of flowering plants should be planted early; but coleus, heliotrope,
                    and the more tender plants should be delayed until the end of the month. Annuals
                    that have been sown in the greenhouse or hotbed may be planted out, and seeds of
                    such sorts as mignonette, sweet alyssum, phlox Drummondii, portulaca, &lt;fcc.,
                    may be sown in the beds or borders.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fruit Garden.—</hi>

                    the ground from drying. Where it has not been convenient before, most of the
                    smaller fruits may yet be planted during the first part of the month. Tobacco
                    dust will dislodge most of the numerous kinds of slugs, caterpillars, or worms

                    thoroughly-decayed manure can be spared, a good sprinkling spread over the lawn

                    and burned if there are berries on them, as the seeds scattered in the soil
                    sometimes produce troublesome weeds. Mulch the beds with 2 or 3 inches of rough
                    manure. All vegetable roots that are yet in the ground, and not designed to be
                    left there over winter, must be dug up in this latitude before the middle of the
                    month, or they may be frozen in. Cover up onions, spinach, sprouts, cabbage, or
                    lettuce plants with a covering of 2 or 3 inches of leaves, hay, or straw, to
                    protect them during the winter. Cabbages that have headed may usually be
                    preserved against injury by frost until the middle of next month, by simply
                    pulling them up and packing them closely in a dry spot in the open field with
                    the heads down and roots up. On approach of cold weather in December they should
                    be covered up with leaves as high as the tops of the roots, or, if the soil is
                    light, it may be thrown over theπi, if leaves are not convenient. Cabbages will
                    keep this way until March if the covering has not been put on too early. Plough
                    all empty ground if practicable, and, whenever time will permit, do trenching
                    and subsoiling. Cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce plants that are in frames
                    should be regularly ventilated by lifting the sash on warm days, and on the
                    approach of very cold weather they should be covered with straw mats or
                    shutters. In the colder latitudes, and even in the Middle States, it is
                    absolutely necessary to protect cauliflower in this way, as it is much more

                    extra hot fires will have to be kept up when the thermometer falls to 34° or 35°
                    in the parlour or conservatory. It is well to set the plants under the benches
                    or on the walks of the greenhouse; if they are in the parlour, move them away
                    from the cold point and protect them with paper; this will usually save them
                    even if the thermometer falls to 24° or 26°. Another plan in the greenhouse is

                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> Maintain the heat in hotbeds and pits by means
                    of fresh dung linings. Give abundance of air in mild bright weather. Dress vines
                    and peaches. Clean and repair the forcing-houses, and overhaul the heating
                    apparatus to see it is in good working condition. Plant chicory or witloef in
                    boxes or on hotbeds for blanching. Sow kidney beans. Make up successional winter
                    mushroom beds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plant Houses.—</hi> Replace all sorts of greenhouse plants.
                    Fill the pits with pots of stocks, mignonette, and hardy annuals for planting
                    out in spring, along with many of the hardy sorts of greenhouse filants; the
                    whole ought to be thoroughly ventilated, except in rosty weather. From this time
                    till spring keep succulent plants almost without water. Sow cyclamens. Begin to
                    force roses, hyacinths, and a few other bulbs, for winter and early spring
                    decoration. Plant hyacinths in glasses for windows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flower Garden.—</hi> Sow a few pots of hardy annuals in a
                    frame, or on a sheltered border, for successional spring use if required. Plant
                    the greater part of the common border bulbs as hyacinths, narcissi, crocuses,
                    and early tulips, about the end of the month, with a few anemones for early
                    flowering. Transplant strong plants of biennials and perennials to their final
                    situations; also the select plants used for spring bedding. Protect alpine
                    plants, stage auriculas, and carnations and picotees with glass frames; and
                    half-hardy greenhouse plants, such as fuchsias, &amp;c., about the end of the
                    month, with coverings of broom or spruce-fir, preferring the latter. Take up,
                    dry, and store dahlias and all tender tubers in the end of the month; pot
                    lobelias and similar half-hardy plants from the open borders. Transplant all
                    sorts of hardy evergreens and shrubs, especially in dry soils, giving abundance
                    of water. Put in cuttings of all sorts of evergreens, &amp;c. Plant out the
                    hardier sorts of roses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">November.</hi><hi rend="italic">Kitchen Garden.—</hi> Trench
                    up all vacant ground as soon as cleared of its crops, leaving the surface as
                    rough as possible. Sow Dillistone’s Early peas and Early Dwarf Prolific beans,
                    in the second week, for an early crop; also in frames for transplanting. Protect
                    endive, celery, artichoke, and sea-kale, with stable-litter or fern, or by
                    planting the former in frames; take up late cauliflower, early broccoli, and
                    lettuces, and place them in sheltered pits or lay them in an open shed; earth up
                    celery; manure and dress up asparagus beds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fruit Garden.—</hi> Plant all sort of fruit trees in fine
                    weather—the earlier in the month the better. Protect fig-trees. Commence pruning
                    and nailing. Gather and store the latest apples and pears. Examine the fruit
                    room, and remove all decayed fruit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> Keep up the requisite degree of heat in hotbeds
                    and pits. Cucumbers and pines, on hotbeds, will require more than ordinary
                    attention, to prevent them damping off from too much moisture; hence the
                    advantage of hot-water heating. Force asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale, in the
                    mushroom-house, in pits, or in the open border under boxes or cases surrounded
                    and covered by well-fermented stable dung and leaves. Sow Early Horn carrot;
                    also kidney beans and radishes, on hotbeds. In the forcing-houses prune and
                    train the trees; fork over and dress the borders of such houses as have not been
                    already done.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plant-Houses.—</hi> The directions for the greenhouse and
                    conservatory in January apply also to this month generally. Continue the forcing
                    of roses, hyacinths, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flower Garden,</hi> &amp;c. —Plant dried tubers of border
                    flowers, but the finer sorts had better be deferred till spring. Plant tulips in
                    the early part of the month. Put in cuttings of bedding calceolarias, choosing
                    the shoots that will not run up to flower. Protect such half-hardy plants as are
                    not already sheltered. Plant deciduous trees and shrubs so long as the weather
                    continues favourable, and before the soil has parted with the solar heat
                    absorbed during summer. Dig and dress such flower borders and shrubberies as may
                    now be cleared of annuals and the stems of herbaceous plants.</p>

                    Collect and smother-burn all vegetable refuse, and apply it as a dressing to the
                    ground. Sow a few peas and beans, in case of accident to those sown in November,
                    drawing up the soil towards the stems of those which are above ground as a
                    protection; earth up celery; blanch endive with flower-pots; sow radishes in a
                    very sheltered place. Attend to trenching and digging in dry weather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fruit Garden.—</hi> Plant all sorts of fruit trees in mild
                    weather. Proceed with pruning and nailing wall-trees. Examine the fruitroom
                    every week, removing promptly all decaying fruit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forcing.—</hi> The same degree of attention to hotbeds and pits
                    will be necessary as in the last month. Continue the forcing of asparagus,
                    rhubarb, and sea-kale, in pits and in the mushroom-house. Proceed with the usual
                    routine of culture commenced last month. Make the necessary preparations to
                    begin forcing early or succession crops by the last week of this or the first of
                    next month.</p>

                    pots must be kept rather dry to prevent damping off. Heaths and Australian

                    repel frost.</p>
