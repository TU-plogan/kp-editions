                            properly Hus, an abbreviation adopted by himself about 1396, is derived.
                            Prior to that date he was invariably known as Johann Hussynecz,
                            Hussinecz, Hussenicz, or De Hussynecz.</p></note> a market village at
                    the foot of the Böhmerwald, and not far from the Bavarian frontier, most
                    probably in 1369, and, according to some accounts, on July 6. His parents appear
                    to have been well-to-do Czechs of the peasant class. Of his early life nothing
                    is recorded except that, notwithstanding the early loss of his father, he
                    obtained a good elementary education, first at Hussinecz, and afterwards at the
                    neighbouring town of Prachaticz. At, or only a very little beyond, the usual age
                    he entered the recently (1348) founded university of Prague, where he became
                    bachelor of arts in 1393, bachelor of theology in 1394, and master of arts in
                    1396. In 1398 he was chosen by the Bohemian “nation” of the university to an
                    examinership for the bachelor’s degree; in the same year he began to lecture
                    also, and there is reason to believe that the philosophical writings of
                    Wickliffe, with which he had been for some years acquainted, were his
                    text-books. In October 1401 he was made dean of the philosophical faculty, and
                    for the half-yearly period from October 1402 to April 1403 he held the office of
                    rector of the university. In 1402 also he was made rector or curate
                    (capeliarius) of the Bethlehem Chapel, which had in 1391 been erected and
                    endowed by some zealous citizens of Prague for the purpose of providing good
                    popular preaching in the Bohemian tongue. This appointment, which, so far as the
                    aims of the pious founders were concerned, proved a singularly successful one,
                    had a deep influence on the already vigorous religious life of Huss himself; and
                    one of the effects of the earnest and independent study of Scripture into which
                    it soon led him was a profound conviction of the great value not only of the
                    philosophical but also of the theological writings of Wickliffe.</p>
                <p>This newly-formed sympathy with the English reformer did not, however, in the
                    first instance at least, involve Huss in any conscious opposition to the
                    established doctrines of Catholicism, or in any direct conflict with the
                    authorities of the church; and for several years he continued to act in full
                    accord with his archbishop (Sbynjek, or Sbynko, of H ιsenburg). Thus in 1405 he,
                    along with other two masters, was commissioned to examine into certain reputed
                    miracles at Wilsnack, near Wittenberg, which had caused that church to be made a
                    resort of pilgrims from all parts of Europe. The result of their report was that
                    all pilgrimage thither from the province of Bohemia was prohibited by the
                    archbishop on pain of excommunication, while Huss, with the full sanction of his
                    superior, gave to the world his first published writing, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">De Omni Sanguine Christi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Glorificato,</hi> in which he declaimed in no measured terms against forged
                    miracles and ecclesiastical greed, urging Christians at the same time to desist
                    from looking for sensible signs of Christ’s presence, but rather to seek Him in
                    His enduring word. More than once also Huss, along with his friend Stanislaus of
                    Znaim, was appointed to be synod preacher, and in this capacity he delivered at
                    the provincial councils of Bohemia many faithful admonitions. As early as May
                    28, 1403, it is true, there had been held a university disputation about the new
                    doctrines of Wickliffe, which had resulted in the condemnation of certain
                    propositions presumed to be his; five years later (May 20, 1408) this decision
                    had been refined into a declaration that these, forty-five in number, were not
                    to be taught in any heretical, erroneous, or offensive sense. But it was only
                    slowly that the growing sympathy of Huss with Wickliffe unfavourably affected
                    his relations with his colleagues in the priesthood. In 1408, however, the
                    clergy of the city and archiepiscopal diocese of Prague laid before the
                    archbishop a formal complaint against Huss, arising out of strong expressions
                    with regard to clerical abuses of which he had made use in his public
                    discourses; and the result was that, having first been deprived of his
                    appointment as synodal preacher, he was, after a vain attempt to defend himself
                    in writing, publicly forbidden the exercise of any priestly function throughout
                    the diocese. Simultaneously with these proceedings in Bohemia, international
                    negotiations had been going on which had for their object the removal of the
                    long-continued papal schism, and it had in the interval become apparent that a
                    satisfactory solution of the difficulties involved could only be secured if, as
                    seemed not impossible, the supporters of the rival popes, Benedict XIII. and
                    Gregory XII., could be induced, in view of the approaching council of Pisa, to
                    pledge themselves to a strict neutrality. With this end King Wenceslaus of
                    Bohemia had requested the co-operation of the archbishop and his clergy, and
                    also the support of the university, in both instances unsuccessfully, although
                    in the case of the latter the Bohemian “nation,” with Huss at its head, had only
                    been overborne by the votes of the Bavarians, Saxons, and Poles. There followed
                    an expression of nationalist and particularistic as opposed to ultramontane and
                    also to German feeling, which undoubtedly was of supreme importance for the
                    whole of the subsequent career of Huss. In compliance with this feeling a royal
                    edict (January 18, 1409) was issued, by which, in alleged conformity with Paris
                    usage, and with the original charter of the university, the Bohemian “nation”
                    received three votes, while only one was allotted to the other three “nations”
                    combined; whereupon all the foreigners, to the number of several thousands,
                    almost immediately withdrew from Prague, an occurrence which led to the
                    formation shortly afterwards of the university of Leipsic.</p>
                <p>It was a dangerous triumph for Huss; for his popularity at court and in the
                    general community had been secured only at the price of clerical antipathy
                    everywhere and of much German ill-will. Among the first results of the changed
                    order of things were on the one hand the election of Huss (October 1409) to be
                    again rector of the university, but on the other hand the appointment by the
                    archbishop of an inquisitor to inquire into charges of heretical teaching and
                    inflammatory preaching which had been brought against him. He had spoken
                    disrespectfully of the church, it was said, had even hinted that Antichrist
                    might be found to be in Rome, had fomented in his preaching the quarrel between
                    Bohemians and Germans, and had, notwithstanding all that had passed, continued
                    to speak of Wickliffe as both a pious man and an orthodox teacher. The direct
                    result of this investigation is not known, but it is impossible to disconnect
                    from it the promulgation by Pope Alexander V., on December 20, 1409, of a bull
                    which ordered the abjuration of all Wickliffite heresies and the surrender of
                    all his books, while at the same time—a measure specially levelled at the pulpit
                    of Bethlehem Chapel—all preaching was prohibited except in localities which had
                    been by long usage set apart for that use. This decree, as soon as it was
                    published in Prague (March 9, 1410), led to much popular agitation, and provoked
                    an appeal by Huss to the pope’s better informed judgment; the archbishop,
                    however, resolutely insisted on carrying out his instructions, and in the
                    following July caused to be publicly burned, in the courtyard of his own <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n420/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0420-0405"/> palace, upwards of 200 volumes of the
                    writings of Wickliffe, while he pronounced solemn sentence of excommunication
                    against Huss and certain of his friends, who had in the meantime again protested
                    and appealed to the new pope (John XXI1I.). Again the populace rose on behalf of
                    their hero, who, in his turn, strong in the conscientious conviction that “in
                    the things which pertain to salvation God is to be obeyed rather than man,”
                    continued uninterruptedly to preach in the Bethlehem Chapel, and in the
                    university began publicly to defend the so-called heretical treatises of
                    Wickliffe, while from king and queen, nobles and burghers, a petition was sent
                    to Rome praying that the condemnation and prohibition in the bull of Alexander
                    V. might be quashed. Negotiations were carried on for some months, but in vain;
                    in March 1411 the ban was anew pronounced upon Huss as a disobedient son of the
                    church, while the magistrates and councillors of Prague who had favoured him
                    were threatened with a similar penalty in case of their giving him a
                    contumacious support. Ultimately the whole city, which continued to harbour him,
                    was laid under interdict; yet he went on preaching, and masses were celebrated
                    as usual, so that at the date of Archbishop Sbynko’s death in September 1411, it
                    seemed as if the utmost efforts of ecclesiastical authority had resulted in
                    absolute failure.</p>
                <p>The struggle, however, entered on a new phase with the appearance at Prague in
                    May 1412 of the papal emissary charged with the proclamation of the papal bulls
                    by which a religious war was decreed against the excommunicated King Ladislaus
                    of Naples, and indulgence was promised to all who should take part in it, on
                    terms similar to those which had been enjoyed by the earlier crusaders to the
                    Holy Land. By his bold and thorough-going opposition to this mode of procedure
                    against Ladislaus, and still more by his doctrine that indulgence could never be
                    sold without simony, and could not be lawfully granted by the church except on
                    condition of genuine contrition and repentance, Huss at last isolated himself,
                    not only from the archiépiscopal party under Albik of Unitschow, but also from
                    the theological faculty of the university, and especially from such men as
                    Stanislaus of Znaim and Stephen Paletz, who until then had been his chief
                    supporters. A popular demonstration, in which the papal bulls had been paraded
                    through the streets with circumstances of peculiar ignominy and finally burnt,
                    led to intervention by Wenceslaus on behalf of public order; three young men,
                    for having openly asserted the unlawfulness of the papal indulgence after
                    silence had been enjoined, were sentenced to death (June 1412); the
                    excommunication against Huss was renewed, and the interdict again laid on all
                    places which should give him shelter,—a measure which now began to be more
                    strictly regarded by the clergy, so that in the following December he had no
                    alternative but to yield to the express wish of the king by temporarily
                    withdrawing from Prague. A provincial synod, held at the instance of Wenceslaus
                    in February 1413, broke up without having reached any practical result; and the
                    labours of a commission appointed shortly afterwards were equally unsuccessful
                    in the attempt to bring about a reconciliation between Huss and his adversaries.
                    The so-called heretic meanwhile spent his time partly at Kozihradek, some 45
                    miles south of Prague, and partly at Krakowitz in the immediate neighbourhood of
                    the capital, sometimes varying the monotony of his life with an occasional
                    course of open-air preaching, but finding his chief employment in maintaining
                    with his numerous friends that copious correspondence of which some precious
                    fragments still are extant, and in the composition of the largest and most
                    exhaustive of all his printed works, the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Ecclesia,</hi> which subsequently furnished most of the
                    material for the capital charges brought against him.</p>
                <p>During the year 1413 the arrangements for the meeting of a general council at
                    Constance were agreed upon between Sigismund and Pope John XXIII. The objects
                    originally contemplated had been the restoration of the unity of the church and
                    its reform in head and members; but so great had become the prominence of
                    Bohemian affairs that to these also a first place in the programme of the
                    approaching oecumenical assembly required to be assigned, and for their
                    satisfactory settlement the presence of Huss was obviously necessary. His
                    attendance was accordingly requested, and the invitation was willingly accepted
                    as giving him a long-wished-for opportunity both of publicly vindicating himself
                    from charges which he felt to be grievous and of loyally making confession for
                    Christ. He set out from Bohemia on October 14, 1414, not, however, until he had
                    carefully ordered all his private affairs, with a presentiment, which he did not
                    conceal, that in all probability he was going to his death. The journey, which
                    appears to have been undertaken with the usual passport, and under the
                    protection of several powerful Bohemian friends (John of Chlum, Wenceslaus of
                    Duba, Henry of Chlum) who accompanied him, was a very prosperous one; and at
                    almost all the halting places he was received with a consideration and
                    enthusiastic sympathy which he had hardly expected to meet with anywhere in
                    Germany. On November 3 he arrived at Constance, and took up quarters in the
                    house which is still pointed out (Paulsgasse, 328); shortly afterwards there was
                    put into his hands the famous imperial “safe conduct,” the promise of which had
                    been one of his inducements to quit the comparative security he had enjoyed in
                    Bohemia. Of this safe conduct, the formal words of which have often been quoted,
                    it would be absurd to say that it was intended to guarantee its holder against
                    the infliction of due punishment should he be convicted by existing law of any
                    crime; but there can be no doubt that both the letter and the spirit of it were
                    scandalously violated, when on November 28 Huss was arbitrarily seized and
                    thrown into prison before any accusation whatever had been formulated. Sigismund
                    himself never sought to defend this act, which was not done with his consent or
                    authority; the only excuse he ever alleged for having tolerated it was that
                    otherwise in all likelihood the council would have been broken up. On December 4
                    the pope appointed a commission of three bishops to investigate the case against
                    the heretic, and to procure witnesses; to the demand of Huss that he might be
                    permitted to employ an agent in his defence a favourable answer was at first
                    given, but afterwards even this concession to the forms of justice was denied.
                    While the commission was engaged in the prosecution of its inquiries, the flight
                    of Pope John XXIII. took place on March 20, an event which furnished a pretext
                    for the removal of Huss from the Dominican convent to a more secure and more
                    severe place of confinement under the charge of the bishop of Constance at
                    Gottlieben on the Rhine. On May 4 the temper of the council on the doctrinal
                    questions in dispute was for the first time fully revealed in its unanimous
                    condemnation of Wickliffe, especially of the so-called “forty-five articles” as
                    erroneous, heretical, revolutionary. It was not, however, until June 5 that the
                    case of Huss himself came up for hearing; the meeting, which was an
                    exceptionally full one, took place in the refectory of the Franciscan cloister.
                    Autograph copies of his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesia,</hi> and of the controversial tracts which he had written against
                    Paletz and Stanislaus of Znaim, having been laid before him and duly
                    acknowledged, the extracted propositions on which the prosecution based their
                    charge of heresy were read; but as soon as the accused began to analyse them and
                    to enter upon his defence, he was assailed by violent outcries, amidst which it
                    was impossible for him to be heard, so that he <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0421-0406"/> was compelled to bring his speech to an
                    abrupt close, which he did with the calm remark; “In such a council as this I
                    had expected to find more propriety, piety, and order.” It was found necessary
                    to adjourn the sitting until June 7, on which occasion the outward decencies
                    were better observed, partly no doubt from the circumstance that the emperor was
                    present in person. The propositions which had been extracted from the <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesia</hi> were again brought up,
                    and the relations between Wickliffe and Huss were discussed, the object of the
                    prosecution being to fasten upon the latter the charge of having entirely
                    adopted the doctrinal system of the former, including especially a denial of the
                    doctrine of transubstantiation. The accused defended himself by repudiating the
                    charge of having abandoned the Catholic doctrine, while at the same time he gave
                    expression to his hearty admiration and respect for the memory of Wickliffe.
                    Being next asked to make an unqualified submission to the council, he expressed
                    himself as unable to do so, while at the same time stating his willingness in
                    all humility to amend his teaching wherever it had been shown to be false. With
                    this the proceedings of the day were brought to a close. On June 8 the
                    propositions extracted from the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesia</hi> were once more taken up with some fulness of detail; some of
                    these he repudiated as incorrectly given, others he defended; but when asked to
                    make a general recantation he steadfastly declined on the ground that to do so
                    would be a dishonest admission of previous guilt. Among the propositions he
                    could heartily abjure was that relating to transubstantiation; among those he
                    felt constrained unflinchingly to maintain was one which had given great
                    offence, to the effect that Christ, not Peter, is the head of the church to whom
                    ultimate appeal must be made. The council, however, showed itself inaccessible
                    to all his arguments and explanations, and its final resolution, as announced by
                    D’Ailly, was threefold :—first, that Huss should humbly declare that he had
                    erred in all the articles cited against him; secondly, that he should promise on
                    oath neither to hold nor teach them in the future; thirdly, that he should
                    publicly recant them. On his declining to make this submission he was removed
                    from the bar, and it was obvious that the end could not be far off. The emperor
                    himself gave it as his opinion that it had been clearly proved by many witnesses
                    that the accused had taught many pernicious heresies, and that even should he
                    recant he ought never to be allowed to preach or teach again or to return to
                    Bohemia, but that should he refuse recantation there was no remedy but the
                    stake. During the next four weeks no effort was spared to shake the
                    determination of Huss; but the spirit of the martyr rose within him as he saw
                    lιis end approaching, and he steadfastly refused to swerve from the path which
                    conscience had once made clear. “I write this,” says he, in a letter to his
                    friends at Prague, “in prison and in chains, expecting tomorrow to receive
                    sentence of death, full of hope in God that I shall not swerve from the truth,
                    nor abjure errors imputed to me by false witnesses.” The sentence he expected
                    was pronounced on July 6 in the presence of the emperor and a full sitting of
                    the council; once and again he attempted to remonstrate, but in vain, and
                    finally he betook himself to silent prayer. After he had undergone the ceremony
                    of degradation with all the childish formalities which are usual on such
                    occasions, his soul was formally consigned by all those present to the devil,
                    while he himself with clasped hands and uplifted eyes reverently committed it to
                    Christ. He was then handed over to the secular arm, and immediately led off to
                    the place of execution, the council meanwhile proceeding unconcernedly with the
                    rest of its business for the day. Many touching incidents recorded in the
                    histories make manifest the meekness, fortitude, and even cheerfulness with
                    which he went to his dreadful death. After he had been tied to the stake and the
                    faggots had been piled, he was for the last time urged to recant, but his only
                    reply was :—“God is my witness that I have never taught or preached that which
                    false witnesses have testified against me. He knows that the great object of all
                    my preaching and writing was to convert men from sin. In the truth of that
                    gospel which hitherto I have written, taught, and preached, I now joyfully die.”
                    The fire was then kindled, and his voice as it audibly prayed in the words of
                    the “Kyrie Eleison” was soon stifled in the smoke. When the flames had done
                    their office, the ashes that were left and even the soil on which they lay were
                    carefully removed and thrown into the Rhine.</p>
                <p>Not many words are needed to convey a tolerably adequate estimate of the
                    character and work of the “pale thin man in mean attire,” who in sickness and
                    poverty thus completed the forty-sixth year of a busy life at the stake. Huss
                    was much less remarkable for the amount of his mental endowments and
                    acquirements than for the candour with which he formed his convictions, the
                    tenacity with which he held them, the unselfish enthusiasm with which he spoke
                    them. He cannot be said to have added a single new item to the intellectual
                    wealth of the world, but his contribution to its moral capital was immense. It
                    might not be easy to formulate very precisely the doctrines for which he died,
                    and certainly some of them, as, for example, that regarding the church, were
                    such as many Protestants even would regard as unguarded and difficult to
                    harmonize with the maintenance of external church order; but his is undoubtedly
                    the honour of having been the chief intermediary in handing on from Wickliffe to
                    Luther the torch which kindled the Reformation, and of having been one of the
                    bravest of the martyrs who have died in the cause of honesty and freedom, of
                    progress and of growth towards the light.</p>
                <p>The works of Huss are usually classed under foui’ heads :—the dogmatical and
                    polemical, the homiletical, the exegetical, and the epistolary. Of those
                    belonging to the first category, the earliest was that <hi rend="italic">Be Omni
                        Sanguine Christi</hi><hi rend="italic">Glorificato,</hi> already referred
                    to; others, besides the <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesia,</hi> are a <hi rend="italic">Ouoestio</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">Refutation of the Writing of the Eight Doctors of Prague.</hi>
                    The sermons include several discourses relating to Antichrist. It is worthy of
                    note, in connexion with these, that by means of them and his other public
                    teaching Huss exercised a considerable influence, not only on the religious life
                    of his time, but on the literary development of his native tongue. His
                    exegetical writings include <hi rend="italic">A History of Jesus Christ
                        according to the Four Gospels, A History of the Passion, An Exposition

                        >Letters</hi> are arranged in two series, one of which, numbering fifteen,
                    relates to the period of his exile under the interdict, while the other,
                    fifty-six in all, belongs to the time when he lived in Constance. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesia</hi> was printed by Ulrich
                    von Hutten as early as 1520, others of the controversial writings by Otto
                    Brunnfels in 1524; and Luther wrote an interesting preface to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Epistoloe Qiiaedam</hi> published in 1537. The earliest collected edition
                    of the Latin works was that of Nuremberg <hi rend="italic">{Historia et
                        Monumenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Joh. Huss</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >atque</hi><hi rend="italic">Hieron. Pragcnsish</hi> published in 1558 in 2
                    vols, folio; this was reprinted with a considerable quantity of new matter in
                    1715. The Bohemian works have recently been edited by K. J. Erben (3 vols.,
                    Prague, 1866).</p>
                <p>On Huss the best and most easily accessible information for the English readers
                    is to be found in the Church Histories, especially in that of Neander (vol. ix.,
                    Engl, trans. 1858), and pre-eminently in Lechler's <hi rend="italic">Wiclef</hi>
                    (1873), translated by Lorimer (1878). Among the earlier authorities is Aeneas
                    Sylvius. <hi rend="italic">De Βohe-rnoru&gt;n</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine ac
