                    is a specially exorcized and consecrated mixture of salt and water, believed to
                    possess, when duly sprinkled, peculiar potency as a remedy for sickness, mental
                    or bodily, and as a protection to property. According to present usage
                    prescribed in the <hi rend="italic">Missal,</hi> it is prepared in the sacristy
                    on Sunday by the priest who is to celebrate high mass (or by some other on whom
                    the duty is devolved): robed in alb and superpelliceum and wearing his stole, he
                    first exorcizes the salt and the water separately; next he mixes the two in the
                    name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and finally he pronounces the prayer of
                    consecration over the mixture. Thereupon he assumes his pluvial, goes to the
                    altar, and takes from the deacon the aspergillum, with which he sprinkles the
                    altar, himself, his assistants, and the congregation, meanwhile repeating the
                    words of Ps. li. 7. The faithful who desire it are afterwards permitted to carry
                    a supply home with them for application to the sick and for similar purposes.
                    Holy water is solemnly used, not only in the consecration of sacred objects,
                    such as churches, churchyards, bells, images, vestments, and the like, but also
                    on various domestic occasions such as marriages and funerals. A holy-water stoup
                    is placed at every church door and the faithful are expected <pb break="no"

                    the building.</p>
                <p>The present Occidental usage with regard to holy water admits of being traced
                    substantially, without a break, back to the Carolingian period. In the
                    pseudo-Isidorian decretals, Alexander, bishop of Rome (c. 109 A.D.), commenting
                    on Heb. ix. 13, is represented as applying that text to prove the purifying
                    power of consecrated salt and water j<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Nam si cinis vitulae adspersus sanguine populum
                    sanctificabat atque mundabat, multo magis aqua sale adspersa divinisque precibus
                    sacrata populum sanctificat atque mundat.</p></note> and in a genuine charge to
                    his clergy Leo IV. (847 A.D.) says, “Every Lord’s day before mass bless water
                    wherewith the people may be sprinkled, and for this have a proper vessel.”
                    Hincmar of Rheims to a similar injunction adds permission to all who may wish to
                    carry some of the water home in their own clean vessels, and sprinkle it <hi

                    cattle also and their provender, and likewise over their own meat and drink.” In
                    Gratian the decree runs —“Webless water sprinkled with salt, that all being
                    therewith besprinkled may be sanctified and purified. Which also we recommend to
                    be done by all priests.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    42) we learn that, in Rome, if not elsewhere in the West, a peculiar sacredness
                    and magical efficacy were attributed, to baptismal water at least, two centuries
                    before the publication of the forged decretals. After the usual consecration of
                    the font on Easter eve, “the whole people, whoever wished, took a blessing in
                    their vessels of the water itself, before the children were baptized in it, to
                    sprinkle about their houses and vineyards and fields and fruits.” We learn from
                    Chrysostom <hi rend="italic">(Be Bapt. Chr.)</hi> that in the East a similar
                    custom prevailed even in his time, while the <hi rend="italic">Apostolical
                    Constitutions</hi> (viii. 29) show that at a somewhat later period (probably in
                    the 5th century) it had become usual also to bless water and oil without any
                    reference to baptismal uses. An indication of later Oriental practice is
                    gathered from Theodore Balsamon (c. 1200), according to whom, by immemorial
                    custom, holy water was in his day consecrated in Greek churches at the beginning
                    of every lunar month. The use of holy water at the church door can be traced
                    back to pre-Christian practice, both Jewish and pagan. The laver in front of the
                    altar (Exod. xxx. 18-21) in the old ritual of Israel had its analogue in the
                    vessels with consecrated water <hi rend="italic">(πeρφf&gt;avτhριa</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">aτro^pavτhpιa)</hi> at the entrance of the peribolos of the Greek
                    temple; from these the entrants used to sprinkle themselves, or to be sprinkled
                    by the priests, to symbolize the purity required of those who sought to enter
                    the sanctuary of God. There is evidence that, as early as Tertullian <hi
                    rend="italic">(Be Oral.,</hi> 11) at least, it was customary to place outside
                    Christian places of worship in the atrium <hi rend="italic">(aiθριov)</hi> a
                    fountain or cistern of watex ’ <hi rend="italic">(κpi</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    about to enter were expected to wash their hands and (perhaps) also the face.
                    The vessel was not taken into the church and placed near the entrance of the
                    nave until after the 8th century. It is not evident at what date it became
                    customary within the Christian Church to mix salt with the water employed for
                    sacramental or quasi-sacramental purposes; this practice also, however, must be
                    traced to pre-Christian usage (see <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> i. 314;
