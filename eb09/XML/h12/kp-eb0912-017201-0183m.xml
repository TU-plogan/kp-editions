                    astronomical observations the brief intervals of leisure snatched from the
                    harassing occupations of a laborious life. In 1636 he met with a congenial
                    spirit in William Crabtree, a draper of Broughton, near Manchester; and
                    encouraged by his advice he exchanged the guidance of Lansberg, a pretentious
                    but inaccurate Belgian astronomer, for that of Kepler. He now set himself to the
                    revision of the Rudolphine Tables (published by Kepler in 1627), and in the
                    progress of his task became convinced that a transit of Venus overlooked by
                    Kepler would nevertheless occur on the 24th of November (O.S.) 1639. He was at
                    this time curate of Hoole, near Preston, having recently taken orders in the
                    Church of England, although, according to the received accounts, he had not
                    attained the canonical age. The 24th of November falling on a Sunday, his
                    clerical duties threatened fatally to clash with his astronomical observations;
                    he was, however, released just in time to witness the punctual verification of
                    his forecast, and carefully noted the progress of the phenomenon during half an
                    hour before sunset (3.15 to 3.45). This transit of Venus is remarkable as the
                    first ever observed, that of 1631 predicted by Kepler having been invisible in
                    Europe. Notwithstanding the rude character of the apparatus at his disposal,
                    Horrocks was enabled by his observation of it to introduce some important
                    corrections into the elements of the planet’s orbit, and to reduce to its exact
                    value the received estimate of its apparent diameter.</p>
                <p>After a year spent at Hoole, he returned to Toxteth, and there, on the eve of a
                    long-promised visit to his friend Crabtree, unexpectedly expired, January 3,
                    1641, in the twenty-second year of his age. It is difficult to overestimate the
                    services which, had his life been prolonged, this singularly gifted youth might
                    have rendered to astronomical science. To the inventive activity of the
                    discoverer he already united the patient skill of the observer and the practical
                    sagacity of the experimentalist. Before he was twenty he had afforded.a specimen
                    of his powers by an important contribution to the lunar theory. He first brought
                    the revolutions of our satellite within the domain of Kepler’s laws, pointing
                    out that her apparent irregularities could be completely accounted for by
                    supposing her to move in an ellipse with a variable eccentricity and directly
                    rotatory major axis, of which the earth occupied one focus. These precise
                    conditions were afterwards demonstrated by Newton to follow necessarily from the
                    law of gravitation.</p>
                <p>In his speculations as to the physical cause of the celestial motions, his mind,
                    though not as yet wholly emancipated from the tyranny of gratuitous assumptions,
                    was working steadily towards the light. He clearly perceived the significant
                    analogy between terrestrial gravity and the force exerted in the solar system,
                    and used an ingenious experiment to illustrate the composite character of the
                    planetary movements. He also reduced the solar parallax to 14" (less than a
                    quarter of Kepler’s estimate), corrected the sun’s semi-diameter to 15' 45",
                    recommended decimal notation, and was the Grstto make tidal observations.</p>
                <p>Only a remnant of the papers left by Horrocks was preserved by the care of
                    William Crabtree. After his death (which occurred soon after that of his
                    friend), these were purchased by Dr Worthington, of Cambridge; and from his
                    hands the treatise <hi rend="italic">Venus in sole visa,</hi> passed into those
                    of Hevelius, and was published by him in ∙1662 with his own observations on a
                    transit of Mercury. The remaining fragments were, under the directions of the
                    Royal Society, reduced by Dr Wallis to a compact form, with the heading <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomia</hi><hi rend="italic">Kep-leriana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >defensa et promota,</hi> and published with numerous extracts from the letters
                    of Horrocks to Crabtree, in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Jcrcmiae
