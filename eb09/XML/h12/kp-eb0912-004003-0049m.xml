                    at the theological seminary of the Presbyterian Church in the same place, where
                    he continued a student until 1819; in 1820 he became assistant teacher; and in
                    1822 he was chosen by the general assembly to be professor of Oriental and
                    Biblical literature there. He spent two years on the Continent, from 1826 to
                    1828, studying under De Sacy in Paris, under Gesenius and Tholuck in Halle, and
                    under Hengstenberg, Neander, and Humboldt in Berlin. In 1840 he was transferred
                    to the chair of <pb break="no"

                    subjects that of polemic theology was added in 1852, and this office he held to
                    the day of his death. In 1825 he established a quarterly publication entitled
                    the <hi rend="italic">Biblical Repertory,</hi> designed to furnish translations
                    and reprints of the best contemporaneous foreign essays on theological and
                    religious subjects. On his return from Europe in 1828 he changed it into a
                    vehicle for publishing original theological essays and reviews, and added the
                    words <hi rend="italic">Princeton Review</hi> to its title. He secured for it
                    the position of theological organ of the old school division of the Presbyterian
                    Church, and continued its principal editor and contributor until 1868. He
                    contributed over 130 articles on subjects ranging through every department of
                    theology and ecclesiology, and all the great practical, ecclesiastical, moral,
                    and national questions of the day. From 1835 to 1868 he wrote yearly an article
                    reviewing the action of each general assembly, which series has exerted a
                    powerful influence over the current opinion and history of the church to which
                    he belonged. The most important of these have been republished in Great Britain
                    and in America, in volumes, under the titles of <hi rend="italic">Hodge’s
                    Essays, Princeton Theological Essays,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hodge’s Church
                    Polity.</hi> He was made doctor of divinity by Rutgers College, N.J., in 1834,
                    moderator of the general assembly (O.S.) in 1846, member of the committee to
                    revise the <hi rend="italic">Book of Discipline</hi> of the Presbyterian Church
                    in 1858, and LL.D, by Washington College, Pa., in 1864. April 24, 1872, the
                    fiftieth anniversary of his election to his professorship, was observed in
                    Princeton as his jubilee by between 400 and 500 representatives of his 3000
                    pupils, when he received congratulatory addresses and letters from all the
                    Presbyterian theological faculties of Scotland and Ireland, and from a majority
                    of those belonging to the various Evangelical churches of America. He continued
                    to instruct his classes uninterruptedly up to the time of his death in
                    Princeton, June 19, 1878. The main characteristics of Hodge were strength and
                    persistence of conviction and of purpose, logical clearness and symmetry of
                    thought and style, energy and effective vigour in the defence of his convictions
                    and in assaults upon what he considered error, sunny cheerfulness of
                    disposition, and humility, tenderness, and gentleness of heart and manner.</p>
