                    flowers, of white, yellow, rose, purple, violet, and other tints, some being
                    almost black. The plant is in its prime about August, but .by careful
                    managemerrt examples may be obtained in blossom from July to as late as
                    November. Hollyhocks are propagated from seed, or by division of the root, or by
                    planting out in rich sandy soil, in a close frame, with a gentle bottom heat,
                    single eyes from woodshoots, or cuttings from outgrowths of the old stock or of
                    the lateral offsets of the spike. The seed may be sown in October under cover,
                    the plants obtained being potted in November, and kept under glass till the
                    following April, or, if it be late-gathered, in May or June, in the open ground,
                    whence, if required, the plants are best removed in October or April. Seedlings
                    may also be raised <pb break="no"

                    heat, in a light and rich moist soil; they should - not be watered till they
                    have made their second leaves, and when large enough for handling should be
                    pricked off in a cold frame; they are subsequently transferred to the
                    flower-bed. Hollyhocks thrive best in a well-trenched and manured sandy loam.
                    The spikes as they grow must be staked; aud water and, for the finest blossoms,
                    liquid manure should be liberally supplied to the roots. Plants for exhibition
                    require pruning of side growths; and it is recommended, when the flowering is
                    over, and the stalks have been cut off 4 to 6 inches above the soil, to earth up
                    the crowns with sand. Some of the finest double-flowered kinds of hollyhock will
                    not bloom well in Scotland. The plant is susceptible of great modification under
                    cultivation. The forms now grown are due to the careful selection and crossing
                    of varieties, first by Mr Charles Baron, a shoemaker at Saffron-Walden, and
                    afterwards by Mr Paul of Cheshunt, Messrs R. B. Bircham, W. Chater, Downie &amp;
                    Laird, John Laing, Anthony Parsons, and other well-known floriculturists. It is
                    found that the most diverse varieties may be raised with certainty from plants
                    growing near together. Darwin from the seed of 11 out of 18 varieties procured
                    62 plants, all perfectly true to their kind, and from the seed of the remaining
                    7 varieties 49 plants, half true and half false. Mr Masters of Canterbury, he
                    relates, saved seed from a great bed of 24 named varieties planted in closely
                    adjoining rows, each of which faithfully reproduced itself, with only sometimes
                    a shade of difference in tint. Since the abundant pollen of the hollyhock
                    becomes ripe, and is for the most part shed, before the stigma of the flower
                    affording it is ready for its reception, the preservation of the individuality
                    of different varieties flourishing side by side, in spite of the frequent visits
                    of bees (unless, as suggested by Mr Turner of Slough, those insects be debarred
                    access to the pollen and stigmas by the doubleness of the flowers), would appear
                    to be due to the prepotency of the pollen of each variety on its own stigma over
                    that of all other plants. The hollyhock is very liable to the attacks of slugs,
                    and to a disease occasioned by a fungus, <hi rend="italic">Puccinia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">malvacearum,</hi> which, originally from South America, attained
                    notoriety in the Australian colonies, and finally, reaching Europe, threatened
                    the extermination of the hollyhock, the soft parts of the leaves of which it
                    destroys, leaving the venation only remaining.</p>
                <p>It has been found especially hurtful to the plant in dry seasons. Wild mallows,
                    upon which also it is parasitic, do not appear to be very injuriously affected
                    by it. As means of getting rid of this pest the following expedients have been
                    resorted to :—the application of a weak aqueous solution of Condy’s fluid, which
                    in killing it turns its natural light grey colour to a rusty black, or of a
                    strong solution of soft soap with sulphur (“Gishurst compound ”); the
                    destruction of the plants, and their replacement by healthy stocks; and, as
                    practised by Mr Chater, cultivation in highly-manured trenches, with all
                    possible exposure to the open air, and mulching during summer.</p>
