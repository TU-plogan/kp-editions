                    About his fifteenth year he entered Yale College, where he graduated in 1741; he
                    afterwards studied divinity at Northampton with Jonathan Edwards; and in 1743 he
                    was ordained pastor of the church at Housatonnuc (now Great Barrington),
                    Massachusetts. There in the midst of a small settlement of only thirty families
                    he laboured for six and twenty years, preaching, studying, and writing, until in
                    1769 he was dismissed from his office on the alleged ground of want of funds for
                    his support. He next began to preach in Newport, Rhode Island, where, in 1770,
                    he was settled as pastor of a small congregation, and where, with an interval
                    from 1776 to 1780, caused by the occupation of the British, he continued to
                    labour until about the close of the century. In 1799 he had an attack of
                    paralysis, from which he never wholly recovered; but he continued to preach
                    occasionally, and with unimpaired mental vigour, almost until his death, which
                    occurred on December 20,1803.</p>
                <p>While in vigour of intellect and in strength and purity of moral tone hardly
                    inferior to Jonathan Edwards, Hopkins considerably excelled his master in force
                    and energy of character. To him belongs the honour of having been one of the
                    first to stir up and organize political action against slavery; and to his
                    persistent though bitterly opposed efforts are chiefly to be attributed the law
                    of 1774, which forbade the importation of negroes into New England, as also that
                    of 1784, which declared that all children of slaves born after the following
                    March should be free. He was the author of numerous pamphlets, addresses, and
                    sermons; and he also published lives of Jonathan Edwards, Susannah Anthony, and
                    Mrs Osborn. But his distinctive theological tenets are chiefly to be sought in
                    his important work, the <hi rend="italic">System of Theology,</hi> which,
                    published in 1791, has had an influence hardly inferior to that exercised by the
                    writings<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n170/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0170-0159"/> of Edwards himself. They may be summed up as
                    follows :— (1) God is the efficient cause of all the volitions of the human
                    heart, whether these be good or evil; (2) the guilt of Adam’s first sin lies
                    upon Adam alone; moral corruption consists exclusively in the opposition offered
                    by the human heart to the doing of that which it is really and fully capable of
                    doing; (3) all virtue or true holiness consists in disinterested benevolence;
                    (4) all sin consists in selfishness; (5) reconciliation and redemption are
                    fundamentally distinct; the former opens the gate of mercy, the latter applies
                    to individuals Christ’s saving benefits; (6) effectual calling consists in a
                    willingness to allow himself to be saved, produced in the heart of the sinner by
                    God; (7) although the righteousness of Christ is the sole ground of the sinner’s
                    justification, yet is that righteousness not imputed; (8) repentance is prior in
                    point of time to the exercise of faith in Christ.</p>
                <p>. The works of Hopkins, first published in two volumes at Boston in 1791,
                    appeared in a 2d edition in 1811. The latest and best edition is that of 1852,
                    in three volumes, also publi-hed at Boston; to it there is prefixed a
                    biographical sketch by Professor Park of Andover.</p>
