                    though the existence of such a Family is probably indisputable. Making allowance
                    then for the imperfect light in which they must at present be viewed, what are
                    here called <hi rend="italic">Meliphagidoe</hi> include some of the most
                    characteristic forms of the ornithology of the great Australian Region—members
                    of the. Family inhabiting almost every part of it, and a single species only,
                        <hi rend="italic">Ptilotis</hi><hi rend="italic">limbata,</hi> being said to
                    occur outside its limits. They all possess, or are supposed to possess, a long
                    protrusible tongue with a brushlike tip, differing, it is believed, in structure
                    from that found in any other bird,— <hi rend="italic">Promerops</hi> perhaps
                    excepted,— and capable of being formed into a suctorial tube, by means of which
                    honey is absorbed from the nectary of flowers, though it would seem that insects
                    attracted by the honey furnish the chief nourishment of many species, while
                    others undoubtedly feed to a greater or less extent on fruits. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Meliphagidoe,</hi> as now considered, are for the most part
                    small birds, never exceeding the size of a Mistletoe Thrush; and they have been
                    divided into more than 20 genera, containing above 200 species, of which only a
                    few can here be particularized. Most of these species have a very confined
                    range, being found perhaps only on a single island or group of islands in the
                    Region, but there are a few which are more widely distributed—such as <hi

                    found over the greater part of Australia and Tasmania. In plumage they vary
                    much. Most of the species of <hi rend="italic">Ptilotis</hi> are characterized
                    by a tuft of white, or in others of yellow, feathers springing from behind the
                    ear. In the greater number of the genus <hi rend="italic">Myzomela</hi><note

                    the Soldier-bird to Australian colonists; but in others no brilliant colour
                    appears, and those of several genera have no special ornamentation, while some
                    have a particularly plain appearance. One of the most curious forms is <hi

                    called from the two tufts of white feathers which hang beneath its chin in great
                    contrast to its dark silky plumage, and suggest a likeness to the bands worn by
                    ministers of several religious denominations when officiating.<note

                            Mr Buller <hi rend="italic">{Birds of New Zealand,</hi> p. 88), while
                            uttering its wild notes, indulges in much gesticulation, which adds to
                            the suggested resemblance. It has great power of mimicry, and is a
                            favourite cage-bird both with the natives and colonists. On one
                            occasion, says this gentleman, he had addressed a large meeting of
                            Maories on a matter of considerable political importance, when
                            “immediately on the conclusion of my speech, and before the old chief to
                            whom my arguments were chiefly addressed had time to reply, a Tui, whose
                            netted cage hung to a rafter overhead, responded in a clear emphatic
                            way, ‘ Tito! ’ (false). The circumstance naturally caused much merriment
                            among my audience, and quite upset the gravity of the venerable old
                            chief Nepia Taratoa. ’ Friend,’ said he, laughing, ‘ your arguments are
                            very good; but my <hi rend="italic">mokai is</hi> a very wise bird, and
                            he is not yet convinced! ’”</p></note> The Bell-bird of the same island,
                        <hi rend="italic">Anthorιιis melaηura—</hi> whose melody excited the
                    admiration of Cook the morning after he had anchored in Queen Charlotte’s
                    Sound—is another member of this Family, and unfortunately seems to be fast
                    becoming extinct. But it would be impossible here to enter much further into
                    detail, though the Wattle-birds, <hi rend="italic">Anthochoera,</hi> of
                    Australia have at least to be named. Mention, however, must be made of the
                    Friar-birds, <hi rend="italic">Tropidorhynchus,</hi> of which nearly a score of
                    species, five of them belonging to Australia, have been described. With their
                    stout bills, mostly surmounted by an excrescence, they seem to be the most
                    abnormal forms of the Family, and most of them are besides remarkable for the
                    baldness of some part at least of their head. They assemble in troops, sitting
                    on dead trees, with a loud call, and are very pugnacious, frequently driving
                    away Hawks and Crows. Mr Wallace <hi rend="italic">{Malay Archipelago,</hi> ii.
                    pp. 150- 153) discovered the curious fact that two species of this genus,— <hi
                        rend="italic">P. bourensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. subcornutus,—</hi>
                    respectively inhabiting the islands of Bouru and Ceram, were the object of
                    natural “mimicry” on the part of two species of Oriole of the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Mimeta, Μ. bouroueηsis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                        forsteni,</hi> inhabiting the same islands, so as to be on a superficial
                    examination identical in appearance,—the Honey-eater and the Oriole of each
                    island presenting exactly the same tints, —the black patch of bare skin round
                    the eyes of the former, for instance, being copied in the latter by a patch of
                    black feathers and even the protuberance on the beak of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tropidorhynchus</hi> being imitated by a similar enlargement of the beak of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mimeta.</hi> The very reasonable explanation which Mr
                    Wallace offers is that the pugnacity of the former has led the smaller
                    Birds-of-prey to respect it, and it is therefore an advantage for the latter,
                    being weaker and less courageous, to be mistaken for it. <hi rend="smallcaps"
