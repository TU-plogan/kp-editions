                <p><label type="entry">HUNTING</label>. The circumstances which render necessary the
                    habitual pursuit of wild animals, either as a means of subsistence or for
                    self-defence, generally accompany a phase of human progress distinctly inferior
                    to the pastoral and agricultural stages; resorted to as a recreation, on the
                    other hand, the practice of the chase in most cases indicates a considerable
                    degree of civilization, and sometimes ultimately becomes the almost distinctive
                    employment of the classes which are possessed of most leisure and wealth. It is
                    only in some of its latter aspects, viz., as a “sport,” pursued on fixed rules
                    and principles, that hunting requires notice here.</p>
                <p>The information we possess as to the field sports of the ancients is in many
                    directions extremely fragmentary. With regard to the ancient Egyptians, however,
                    we learn that the huntsmen constituted an entire subdivision of the great second
                    caste; they either followed the chase on their own account, or acted as the
                    attendants of the chiefs in their hunting excursions, taking charge of the dogs,
                    and securing and bringing home the game. The game was sought in the open deserts
                    which border on both sides the valley of the Nile; but (by the wealthy)
                    sometimes in enclosed spaces into which the animals had been driven, or in
                    preserves. Besides the noose and the net, the arrow, the dart, and the hunting
                    pole or <hi rend="italic">venabulum</hi> were frequently employed. The animals
                    chiefly hunted were the gazelle, ibex, oryx, stag, wild ox, wild sheep, hare,
                    and porcupine; also the ostrich for its plumes, and the fox, jackal, wolf,
                    hyaena, and leopard for their skins, or as enemies of the farm-yard. The lion
                    was occasionally trained as a hunting anima] instead of the dog. The sportsman
                    appears, occasionally at least, in the later periods, to have gone to cover in
                    his chariot or on horseback; according to Wilkinson, when the dogs threw off in
                    a level plain of great extent, it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n406/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0406-0393"/> was even usual for him “to remain in his chariot,
                    and, urging his horses to their full speed, endeavour to turn or intercept them
                    as they doubled, discharging a well-directed arrow whenever they came within its
                    range.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See on this
                    whole subject ch. viii. of Wilkinson’s <hi rend="italic">Ancient Egyptians</hi>
                    (ii. 78-92, ed. Birch, 1878).</p></note> The partiality for the chase which the
                    ancient Egyptians manifested was shared by the Assyrians and Babylonians, as is
                    shown by the frequency with which hunting scenes are found depicted on the walls
                    of their temples and palaces, and also by the alleged fact that even their
                    dresses and furniture were ornamented with similar subjects.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Layaπl <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nineveh,</hi> ii. 431, 432), who cites Ammian. Marcell., xxvi. 6, and Athen.,
                    xii. 9.</p></note> The game pursued included the lion, the wild ass, the
                    gazelle, and the hare, and the implements chiefly employed seem to have been the
                    javelin and the bow. There are indications that hawking was also known. The
                    Assyrian kings also maintained magnificent parks, or “paradises,” in which game
                    of every kind was enclosed; and perhaps it was from them that the Persian
                    sovereigns borrowed the practice mentioned both by Xenophon in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyropoedia,</hi> and by Curtius. According to Herodotus, Cyrus
                    devoted the revenue of four great towns to meet the expenses of his hunting
                    establishments. The circumstances under which the death of the son of Croesus is
                    by the same writer (i. 34-45) related to have occurred incidentally show in what
                    high estimation the recreation of hunting was held in Lydia. In Palestine game
                    has always been plentiful, and the Biblical indications that it was much sought
                    and duly appreciated are numerous. As means of capture, nets, traps, snares, and
                    pitfalls are most frequently alluded to; but the arrow (Isa. vii. 24), the
                    spear, and the dart (Job xli. 26-29) are also mentioned. There is no evidence
                    that the use of the dog (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> iv. 8, 10,
                    notwithstanding) or of the horse in hunting was known among the Jews during the
                    period covered by the Old Testament history; Herod, however, was a keen and
                    successful sportsman, and is recorded by Josephus (Ae <hi rend="italic">J.,</hi>
                    i. 21, 13, compare <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xv. 7, 7; xvi. 10, 3) to have
                    killed no fewer than forty head of game (boar, wild ass, deer) in one day. The
                    sporting tastes of the ancient Greeks, as may be gathered from many references
                    in Homer (ZZ.,ix. 538-545; <hi rend="italic">Od.,</hi> ix. 120; xvii. 295, 316;
                    xix. 429 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> had developed themselves at a very early
                    period; they first found adequate literary expression in the work of Xenophon
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Cynegeticus,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>EngL transi, by Blane.</p></note><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> z</hi> which expounds his principles and embodies his experience
                    in his favourite art of hunting. The treatise chiefly deals with the capture of
                    the hare; in the author’s day the approved method was to find the hare in her
                    form by the use of dogs; when found she was either driven into nets previously
                    set in her runs, or else run down in the open. Boar-hunting is also described;
                    it was effected by nets into which the animal was pursued, and in which when
                    fairly entangled he was speared. The stag, according to the same work, was taken
                    by means of a kind of wooden trap <hi rend="italic">(ποΰοστράβη)</hi> which
                    attached itself to the foot. Lions, leopards, lynxes, panthers, and bears are
                    also specially mentioned among the large game; sometimes they were taken in
                    pitfalls, sometimes speared by mounted horsemen. As a writer on field sports
                    Xenophon was followed by Arrian, who in his <hi rend="italic">Cynegeticus,</hi>
                    in avowed dependence on his predecessor, seeks to supplement such deficiencies
                    in the earlier treatise as arose from its author’s unacquaintance with the dogs
                    of Gaul and the horses of Scythia and Libya. Four bδoks of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynegetica,</hi> extending to about 2100 hexameters, by Oppian have also been
                    preserved; the last of these is incomplete, and it is probable that a fifth at
                    one time existed. The poem contains some good descriptive passages, as well as
                    some very curious indications of the state of zoological knowledge in the
                    author’s time. Hunting scenes are frequently represented in ancient works of
                    art, especially the boar-hunt, and also that of the hare. In Roman literature
                    allusions to the pleasures of the chase (wild ass, boar, hare, fallow deer,
                    being specially mentioned as favourite game) are not wanting (Virg., <hi
                    rend="italic">Georg.,</hi> iii. 409-413; <hi rend="italic">Ecl.,</hi> iii. 75;
                    Hor..O√., i. 1, 25-28); it seems to have been viewed, however, with less favour
                    as an occupation for gentlemen, and to have been chiefly left to inferiors and
                    professionals. The immense <hi rend="italic">vivaria</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >theriotropheia,</hi> in which various wild animals, such as boars, stags, and
                    roe-deer, were kept in a state of semi-domestication, were developments which
                    arose at a comparatively late period; as also were the <hi rend="italic"
                    >venationes</hi> in the circus, although these are mentioned as having been
                    known as early as 186 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The bald and meagre poem of
                    Gratius Faliscus on hunting <hi rend="italic">(Cynegetica)</hi> is modelled upon
                    Xenophon’s prose work; a still extant fragment (315 lines) of a similar poem
                    with the same title, of much later date, by Nemesianus, seems to have at one
                    time formed the introduction to an extended work corresponding to that of
                    Oppian. That the Romans had borrowed some things in the art of hunting from the
                    Gauls may be inferred from the name <hi rend="italic">canis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gallicus</hi> (Spanish <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >al go)</hi> for a greyhound, which is to be met with both in Ovid and Martial;
                    also in the words <hi rend="italic">(canis) vertragus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >segusius,</hi> both of Celtic origin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >u. Hausthiere,</hi> p. 327.</p></note> According to Strabo (p. 200) the Britons
                    also bred dogs well adapted for hunting purposes. The addiction of the Franks in
                    later centuries to the chase is evidenced by the frequency with which not only
                    the laity but also the clergy were warned by provincial councils against
                    expending so much of their time and money on hounds, hawks, and falcons; and we
                    have similar proof with regard to the habits of other Teutonic nations
                    subsequent to the introduction of Christianity.<note anchored="true"

                    “Hunting.”</p></note> Originally among the northern nations sport was open to
                    every one<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Vita omnis in

                    not permitted to bear arms; the growth of the idea of game-preserving was a
                    gradual one, and kept pace with the development of feudalism. For its ultimate
                    development in Britain see <hi rend="smallcaps">Forest Law,</hi> where also the
                    distinction between beasts of forest or venery, beasts of chase, and beasts and
                    fowls of warren is explained. See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Game Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>The English word “hunt” (from <hi rend="italic">henten,</hi> “to capture,” and
                    thus nearly equivalent to “chase,” which is the doublet of the verb “to catch”;
                    compare Ital. <hi rend="italic">caccia,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">chasse)</hi>
                    has come specially to be applied to the pursuit of the stag, hare, and fox,
                    especially of the last-named, with horse, hound, and horn, as distinguished from
                    other modes of capturing game. It thus corresponds to the French <hi
                    rend="italic">chasse au courre,</hi> as distinguished from <hi rend="italic"
                    >chasse au tir, à l'oiseau</hi> &amp;c., and to the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hetzjagd</hi> as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Birsch.</hi> The origin
                    of the sport in Britain does not admit of being historically traced. Doubtless
                    the early inhabitants shared to a large extent in the habits of the other Celtic
                    peoples; the fact that at least they kept good hunting dogs is vouched for, as
                    we have seen, by Strabo; and an interesting illustration of the manner in which
                    these were used is given in the inscription quoted by Orelli <hi rend="italic"
                    >(n.</hi> 1603)—“Silvano Invicto Sacrum—ob aprumeximiaeformae captum, quem multi
                    antecessores praedari non potuerunt.” When the period of Alfred the Great is
                    reached, we have it on the authority of Asseri us, his biographer, that before
                    he was twelve years of age he “was a most expert and <pb break="no"

                    of that noble art, to which he applied with incessant labour and amazing
                    success.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Strutt,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sports and Pastimes,</hi> who also gives an illustration,
                    “taken from a manuscriptal painting of the 9th century in the Cotton Library,”
                    representing “a Saxon chieftain, attended by his huntsman and a couple of
                    hounds, pursuing the wild swine in a forest.”</p></note> Of his grandson
                    Athelstan it is related byWilliam of Malmesbury that after the victory of
                    Brunanburgh he imposed upon the vanquished king of Wales a yearly tribute, which
                    included a certain number of “hawks and sharp-scented dogs fit for hunting wild
                    beasts.” According to the same authority, one of the greatest delights of Edward
                    the Confessor was “to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit of game, and to
                    cheer them with his voice.” It was under the Anglo-Saxon kings that the
                    distinction between the higher and lower chase first came to be made,—the former
                    being expressly for the king or those on whom he had bestowed the pleasure of
                    sharing in it, while only the latter was allowed to the proprietors of the land.
                    To the reign of Cnut belong the “Constitutiones de Foresta,” according to which
                    four thanes were appointed in every province for the administration of justice
                    in all matters connected with the forests; under them were four inferior thanes
                    to whom was committed immediate care of the vert and venison.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Lappenberg, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist, of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings</hi> (ii. 361,
                    Thorpe’s transi.).</p></note> The severity of the forest laws which prevailed
                    during the Norman period is sufficient evidence of the sporting ardour of
                    William and his successors. The Conqueror himself, we are told by his
                    contemporaries, “loved the high game as if he were their father;” and the
                    penalty for the unauthorized slaughter of a hart or hind was loss of both
                    eyes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stag Hunting.—</hi> Although at an early period stag hunting
                    was a favourite recreation with royalty, it is difficult to say when the royal
                    buckhounds were first established. It seems probable that in the reign of Henry
                    VIII. the royal pack was kennelled at Swinley, where, in the reign of Charles
                    II. (1684), a deer was found that went away to Lord Petre’s seat in Essex; only
                    five got to the end of this 70 miles’ run, one being the king’s brother, the
                    duke of York. George III. was a great stag hunter, and met the royal pack as
                    often as possible.</p>
                <p>The Devon and Somerset staghounds are the only pack in England that now pursue
                    the wild red deer. In his interesting work, <hi rend="italic">The Chase of the
                    Wild Red Deer,</hi> Mr Collyns says that the earliest record of a pack of
                    staghounds in the Exmoor district is in 1598, when Hugh Polland, Queen
                    Elizabeth’s ranger, kept one at Simonsbath. The succeeding rangers of Exmoor
                    forest kept up the pack until nearly 200 years ago, the hounds subsequently
                    passing into the possession of Mr Walter of Stevenstone, an ancestor of the
                    Rolle family. Successive masters continued the sport until 1825, when the fine
                    pack, descended probably from the blood hound crossed with the old southern
                    hound, was sold in London. It is difficult to imagine how the dispersion of such
                    a pack could have come about in such a sporting country, but in 1827 the late
                    Sir Arthur Chichester got a pack together, and the country has been hunted ever
                    since, the present master being Mr Fenwick Bissett. Stag hunting begins on the
                    12 th of August, and ends on the 8th of October; there is then a cessation until
                    the end of the month, when the hounds are unkennelled for hind hunting, which
                    continues up to Christmas; it begins again about Lady day, and lasts till the 10
                    th of May. The mode of hunting with the Devon and Somerset hounds is briefly
                    this :—the whereabouts of a warrantable stag is communicated to the master by
                    that important functionary the harbourer; two couple of steady hounds called
                    tufters are then thrown into cover, and, having singled out a warrantable deer,
                    follow him until he is forced to make for the open, when the body of the pack
                    are laid on. Very often two or three hours elapse before the stag breaks, but a
                    run over the wild country fully atones for the delay. With all other packs of
                    staghounds, except one in the New Forest, which hunts fallow deer, the quarry is
                    the carted deer; the animal is turned out from a vehicle resembling a prison van
                    in appearance, and the hounds are laid on after a quarter of an hour’s law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fox Hunting.—</hi> It is only within comparatively recent times
                    that the fox has come to be considered as an animal of the higher chase. William
                    Twici, indeed, who was huntsman-in-chief to Edward II., and who wrote in Norman
                    French a treatise on hunting, which still exists in an English translation,
                    mentions the fox as a beast of venery, but obviously as an altogether inferior
                    object of sport. Strutt also gives an engraving, assigned by him to the 14 th
                    century, in which three hunters, one of whom blows a horn, are represented as
                    unearthing a fox, which is pursued by a single hound. The precise date of the
                    establishment of the first pack of hounds kept entirely for fox hunting cannot
                    be accurately fixed. In the work of “Nimrod” (C. J. Apperley), entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Chase,</hi> there is (p. 4) an extract from a letter from Lord
                    Arundel, dated February 1833, in which the writer says that his ancestor, Lord
                    Arundel, kept a pack of foxhounds between 1690 and 1700, and that they remained
                    in the family till 1782, when they were sold to the celebrated Hugh Meynell, of
                    Quorndon Hall, Leicestershire. Lord Wilton again, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sf&gt;orts and Pursuits of the English,</hi> says that “about the year 1750
                    hounds began to be entered solely to fox.” The <hi rend="italic">Field</hi> of
                    November 6, 1875, p. 512, contains an engraving of a hunting-horn then in the
                    possession of the late master of the Cheshire hounds, and upon the horn is the
                    inscription :—“Thomas Boothby, Esq., Tooley Park, Leicester. With this horn he
                    hunted the first pack of foxhounds then in England fifty-five years. Born 1677.
                    Died 1752. Now the property of Thomas d’Avenant, Esq., county Salop, his
                    grandson.” These extracts do not finally decide the point, because both Mr
                    Boothby’s and Lord Arundel’s hounds may have hunted other game besides fox, just
                    as in Edward IV.’s time there were “fox dogs” though not kept exclusively for
                    fox. On the whole, it is probable that Lord Wilton’s surmise is not far from
                    correct. Since fox hunting first commenced, however, the system of the sport has
                    been much changed. In our grandfathers’ time the hounds met early, and found the
                    fox by the drag, that is, by the line he took to his kennel on his return from a
                    foraging expedition. Hunting the drag was doubtless a great test of nose, but
                    many good runs must have been lost thereby, for the fox must often have heard
                    the hounds upwind, and have moved off before they could get on good terms with
                    him. At the present day, the woodlands are neither so large nor so numerous as
                    they formerly were, while there are many more gorse covers; therefore, instead
                    of hunting the drag up to it, a much quicker way of getting to work is to find a
                    fox in his kennel; and, the hour of meeting being later, the fox is not likely
                    to be gorged with food, and so unable to take care of himself at the pace at
                    which the modern foxhound travels.</p>
                <p>On hunting days it is the master’s duty to say what covers are to be drawn, and
                    to request the field to take up such positions as will enable the fox to have
                    fair play. The management of the field requires considerable firmness, but the
                    very strong language one sometimes hears is better avoided. Where a professional
                    huntsman is employed, he is responsible for the actual hunting, and the less he
                    is interfered with by the master or anybody else the better. The country should
                    be hunted fairly throughout<pb break="no"

                    the subscribers living in the different districts, but with a view to sport.
                    Woodlands of greater or less extent are to be found even in countries
                    denominated open, and these places are generally strongholds for foxes, and
                    should be regularly rattled throughout the season; if this be neglected, the
                    foxes, instead of breaking quickly, will ring about the cover all day, and, what
                    is worse, many small covers will be drawn blank by reason of their inhabitants
                    seeking the quietude of the wood. The frequent hunting of woodlands, though
                    conducive in the long run to sport, is not popular with the field. It is on the
                    whole a matter for congratulation that most packs of hounds are now carried on
                    by subscription. Little by little the expense attending a pack of hounds has
                    increased until it has now assumed large proportions: the hounds must be of the
                    best blood; at least five horses per hunting day (exclusive of the master’s)
                    must be allowed for the hunt servants; no makeshifts for kennel or stable will
                    be tolerated; and the hunt servants must be men of known character. Under these
                    circumstances, a master undertaking to keep hounds at his own expense incurs
                    great cost for the benefit of others, or else, being judged by the standard of
                    great establishments, lays himself open to a charge of only half doing what he
                    has put his hand to. If hunting is as popular as it is supposed to be, it is for
                    every reason advisable that those who derive amusement from it should contribute
                    something towards the general expenses. In establishments conducted upon a
                    liberal scale, the annual cost will amount to about £620 a year for each day in
                    the week that the pack hunts; thus, a three days a week pack will cost about
                    £1860 per annum, a four days a week pack £2480, and so on; but absolute
                    efficiency cannot be maintained much under £520 per day.</p>
                <p>The author of the <hi rend="italic">Diary of a Huntsman</hi> says that, to be
                    perfect, “a huntsman should possess the following qualifications—health, memory,
                    decision, temper, patience, a good ear, voice, and sight, courage and spirits,
                    perseverance and activity; and with these he will make a slow pack quick.”
                    Should the master be his own huntsman, he will, save about £300 a year, but he
                    should unite as many as possible of the above list of virtues to those he is
                    possessed of in his capacity of master. The position of a huntsman is a peculiar
                    one; he is the servant of the master, yet the latter must to a certain extent
                    make a confidant of him, as in cases of breeding, drawing the hounds for a day’s
                    hunting, and other matters. A huntsman must be fond of his calling, or he will
                    not be energetic in the pursuit of it; he must also be a bold horseman,—if a
                    good one so much the better,—for nothing is more annoying to the master and the
                    field than to see a huntsman refuse to cast his hounds in an obviously probable
                    direction, because the doing so would necessitate jumping an ugly fence.
                    Observation and decision are also indispensable. When hounds check, the proper
                    course to pursue is very often suggested by some trifling incident which
                    occurred perhaps ten minutes before, and which was noticed at the time without
                    any particular weight being attached to it; for instance, some rooks might have
                    been hovering on the left or right of the line the hounds were running; or
                    again, some hound that can be depended on diverges for a moment from the rest of
                    the pack. The huntsman remembers this when the check takes place, and tries in
                    that direction, often with success. When once a check occurs, decision should be
                    shown in acting promptly; right or wrong, the huntsman must do something, and
                    must have a reason for what he does. Authorities are not wanting who reckon
                    youth as one of a huntsman’s qualities; but huntsmen, like hunters, are not at
                    their best until half worn out. There is so much to learn in the nature of the
                    fox, so many isolated cases must have been observed in order to deduce a
                    principle from them, that a young man cannot possibly have the experience
                    necessary to show the best sport, and our hunting records tell of men who have
                    continued to ride boldly and to show no signs of age when fifty years old.</p>
                <p>The method of hunting a pack of hounds varies somewhat in different countries.
                    One of the most accepted canons is that the huntsman should not interfere with
                    his hounds more than is necessary. So long as hounds can hunt, it is best to let
                    them do so, for if their heads are once got up by hallooing and lifting, they
                    will not so readily settle down again; while hounds that are in the habit of
                    being lifted and galloped off to a distant point whenever a check occurs, will
                    generally look for assistance, and will make but little use of their own noses
                    on cold scenting days. Some countries are naturally bad-scenting ones, and, in
                    order to kill a fox in them, hounds must be lifted more than in others.</p>
                <p>Huntsmen are often much abused, when drawing a large cover, for not going away
                    with the first fox. There is a difference of opinion whether, if hounds are
                    running one fox in cover, they should be stopped and put on the line of one that
                    has gone away. Something will depend upon whether the cover was well worked
                    during cub hunting or not, and whether foxes are plentiful or scarce, but after
                    the 1st of February the rule should be to go away with the first fox that
                    breaks, or the hounds may get on a vixen.</p>
                <p>The whipper-in, to be a success, must be content to suppress himself for the
                    public good. When a “good thing” occurs, and the huntsman is going as hard as he
                    can, and many of the field harder than they like, the whip, or, if two be kept,
                    the second whip, should wait in cover and come on with the tail hounds. A good
                    whip can do more in the furtherance of sport than any huntsman; in the interest,
                    therefore, of fox hunting, there must be no rivalry, or rather no manifestation
                    of it, between the huntsman and the whip. A noisy fellow is an abomination; and
                    the whip should carefully avoid rating a hound after seeing that his voice is
                    entirely disregarded. If needs be a hound must be flogged and that soundly, but
                    he should never be struck without knowing what it is for; thus, it is of no use,
                    twenty minutes after a hound has ceased to run riot, to get alongside of him,
                    bellow out his name, and then flog him; to warrant the use of the lash, he must
                    be caught <hi rend="italic">flagrante delicto,</hi> and must pay no heed to
                    rating. Where, however, hounds have been properly entered and treated, they will
                    require but little chastisement. On approaching a cover, one whip should go on
                    in advance and station himself on the lee side of it, where he may often see a
                    fox steal away as soon as the hounds are thrown in. Although some packs have
                    only one whip, a second is very desirable, especially before Christmas, and in
                    countries where there is much woodland. One whip can then go into cover and keep
                    near the huntsman in readiness to obey any directions he may give, and the other
                    is free to see to other matters.</p>
                <p>The earth-stopper is an important functionary in countries where there are many
                    earths, for if he neglects his business blank days will probably result with
                    annoying frequency. When properly carried out, earth-stopping consists in a man
                    going round and stopping all the earths in the district to be hunted over during
                    the day, so that when foxes return from finding their food, which they do some
                    hours before it is light, they shall find tbeir own door barred against them.
                    This involves the earth-stopper being astii shortly after 2 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.</hi> Μ., not the most pleasant hour of the twenty-four on a winter’s day. If
                    he gets to work late, he stops all the foxes in instead of out; and, when the
                    cover is drawn, no one can understand how the fox which has been seen about for
                    the last fortnight cannot be <pb break="no"

                    particularly desired.</p>
                <p>Cub hunting carried out on a proper principle is one of the secrets of a
                    successful season. To the man who cares for hunting, as distinct from riding,
                    September and October are not the least enjoyable months of the whole hunting
                    season. As soon as the young entry have recovered from the operation of
                    “rounding,” arrangements for cub hunting begin. The hounds must have first of
                    all walking, then trotting and fast exercise, so that their feet may be
                    hardened, and all superfluous fat worked off by the last week in August. So far
                    as the hounds are concerned, the object of cub hunting is to teach them their
                    duty; it is a dress rehearsal of the November business. In company with a
                    certain proportion of old hounds, the youngsters learn to stick to the scent of
                    a fox, in spite of the fondness they have acquired for that of a hare, from
                    running about when at walk. When cubbing begins, a start is made at 4 or 5 A.M.,
                    and then the system is adopted of tracking the cub by his drag. A certain amount
                    of blood is of course indispensable for hounds, but it should never be forgotten
                    that a fox cub of seven or eight months old, though tolerably cunning, is not so
                    very strong; the huntsman should not therefore be over-eager in bringing to hand
                    every cub he can find. It would be a move in the right direction if noses were
                    not to be counted until the first of November.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hare hunting,</hi> which must not be confounded with <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Coursing (&lt;∕.v.),</hi> is an excellent school both for men
                    and for horses. It is attended with the advantages of being cheaper than any
                    other kind, and of not needing so large an area of country. Hare hunting
                    requires considerable skill; Beckford even goes so far as to say—“There is more
                    of true hunting with harriers than with any other description of hounds In the
                    first place, a hare, when found, generally describes a circle in her course
                    which naturally brings her upon her foil, which is the greatest trial for
                    hound*. Secondly, the scent of the hare is weaker than that of any other animal
                    we hunt, and, unlike some, it is always the worse the nearer she is to her end.”
                    Hare hunting is essentially a quiet amusement; no hallooing at hounds nor whip
                    cracking should be permitted; nor should the field make any noise when a hare is
                    found, for, being a timid animal, she might be headed into the hounds’ mouths.
                    Capital exercise and much useful knowledge are to be derived by running with a
                    pack of beagles. There are the same difficulties to be contended with as in
                    hunting with the ordinary harrier, and a very few days’ running will teach the
                    youthful sportsman that he cannot run at the same pace over sound ground and
                    over a deep ploughed field, up hill and down, or along and across furrows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Otter hunting,</hi> which is less practised now than formerly,
                    begins just as all other hunting is drawing to a close. When the waterside is
                    reached an attempt is made to hit upon the track by which the otter passed to
                    his “couch,” which is generally a hole communicating with the river, into which
                    the otter often dives on first hearing the hounds. When the otter “vents” or
                    comes to the surface to breathe, his muzzle only appears above water, and when
                    he is viewed or traced by the mud he stirs up, or by air bubbles, the hounds are
                    laid on. Notwithstanding the strong scent of the otter, he often escapes the
                    hounds, and then a cast has to be made. When he is viewed an attempt is made to
                    spear him by any of the field who may be within distance; if their spears miss,
                    the owners must wade to recover them. Should the otter be transfixed by a spear,
                    the person who threw it goes into the water and raises the game over his head on
                    the spear’s point. If instead of being speared, he is caught by the hounds, he
                    is soon worried to death by them, though frequently not before he has inflicted
                    some severe wounds on one or more of the pack.</p>
                <p>Quitting the United Kingdom, we find that the elephant, hyaena, hunting leopard,
                    and a small species of panther known as the ounce, are not only objects of
                    chase, but are themselves trained to assist in the capture of other animals. The
                    elephant has been found of great service in lion and tiger hunting, his size
                    affording comparative safety to the hunters seated on his back. The hyaena,
                    which resembles a dog in many particulars, is said to be as tractable, when
                    properly trained, and to be of much use in the pursuit of game. The hunting
                    leopard or cheetah and the ounce are used in hunting a species of antelope. They
                    have hoods put over their heads, and are taken in a small waggon into the field;
                    when the deer is seen the hood is taken off and the animal starts in pursuit,
                    followed by the hunter; when the game is secured the hood is again put on. In
                    India field sports are largely indulged in, owing partly to natural facilities,
                    and partly to the taste for hunting characteristic of the English resident
                    there. Tigers are sometimes caught in traps, and sometimes shot in the jungle
                    from the back of an elephant; they seek to conceal themselves, and very rarely
                    commence hostilities against mankind, but when severely wounded and brought to
                    bay they fight courageously. Hunting the wild hog, or “pig sticking,” as it is
                    often termed, is a favourite sport in India; the ground is walked over by
                    beaters, and when a hog is roused the two mounted huntsmen nearest to him start
                    in pursuit, and endeavour to spear him. The riding requires judgment and very
                    good nerves: hollows, ravines, and cracks in the ground caused by the sun are
                    numerous, and, as they are hidden by the tall grass, the horse cannot avoid
                    them; it is said that no horse can run down a hog in less than a mile, even over
                    the best ground, while over a rough country the distance travelled amounts to
                    three or four. The rider’s aim is to blow the hog sufficiently before getting
                    within spearing distance—for the charge of an untired hog is a dangerous affair;
                    but when near a thick cover the sportsman must try to spear him at all hazards,
                    or make up his mind to lose him. The proper management of the spear requires
                    considerable practice. Besides the above mentioned animals, the fox, jackal,
                    wolf, hyaena, buffalo, and four-horned antelope are also objects of the
                    chase.</p>
                <p>Australia was formerly the scene of a great deal of kangaroo hunting, but that
                    animal is now comparatively scarce.</p>
                <p>In Africa there is plenty of big-game hunting, the list including the elephant,
                    lion, giraffe, hippopotamus, antelopes of various kinds, leopard, hyaena,
                    buffalo, jackal, and ostrich. Of these the larger and more dangerous animals are
                    killed as opportunity offers, but the jackal is hunted by English settlers like
                    a fox. Ostrich hunting is somewhat peculiar; the bird is pursued by men on
                    horseback, and, though over the ground it is swifter than a horse, it generally
                    runs in a large circle, so that the riders, by describing a smaller circle and
                    relieving one another, are enabled to keep tolerably near to it, and so to ride
                    it down.</p>
                <p>In North America the bison, an animal sometimes when full grown weighing as much
                    as 142 stone, is pursued by the natives on horseback and then shot. The moose is
                    chased towards a ravine or a snowdrift, and when he begins tô flounder in the
                    snow he is shot at by the hunters. The red deer is now hunted with staghounds
                    upon the English principle. South America affords hunting after the puma, tapir,
                    and wild bull, the lasso being the usual means of capture.</p>
                <p>In Russia, bears, wolves, and wild boars are hunted. Wolves are found in Germany,
                    where they are not only hunted by properly trained wolf-hounds, but are killed
                    by any available means.</p>
                <p>France offers facilities for hunting the wolf, wild boar, <pb break="no"

                    a considerable amount of enthusiasm, is not carried out in a manner strictly in
                    accordance with English ideas. The weak point in French hunting is that the
                    huntsmen do not seem to possess a particularly accurate knowledge of the habits
                    and characteristics of the animal they pursue. Then again their system of kennel
                    management is not what it might be. To show sport in the vast forests, the
                    hounds should be in good health and well-trained, and there should be plenty of
                    them. Of late years, however, more attention has been paid to hound breeding and
                    kennel management, and with encouraging results. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. d.
