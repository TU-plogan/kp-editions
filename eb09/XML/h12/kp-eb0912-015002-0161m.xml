                    was born at Heavitree, near the city of Exeter, about the end of 1553 or
                    beginning of 1554. At school, not only his facility in mastering his tasks, but
                    his intellectual inquisitiveness and his fine moral qualities, attracted the
                    special notice of his teacher, who strongly recommended his parents to educate
                    him for the church. Though well connected, they were, however, somewhat
                    straitened in their worldly circumstances, and Hooker was indebted for admission
                    to the university to his uncle, John Hooker, chamberlain of Exeter, and in his
                    day a man of some literary repute, who, besides giving him an annual pension,
                    induced Bishop Jewel to become his patron and to bestow on him a clerk’s place
                    in Corpus College, Oxford. To this Hooker was admitted in 1567. Bishop Jewel
                    died in September 1571, but Dr Cole, president of the college, from the strong
                    interest he felt in the young man, on account at once of his character and his
                    abilities, spontaneously offered to take the bishop’s place as his patron; and
                    shortly afterwards Hooker, by his own labours as a tutor, became independent of
                    gratuitous aid. Two of his pupils, and these his favourite ones, were Edwin
                    Sandys, afterwards author of <hi rend="italic">Europoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum,</hi> and George Cranmer, grand-nephew of the archbishop. Hooker’s
                    reputation as a tutor soon became very high, for he had employed his five years
                    at the university to such good purpose as not only to have acquired great
                    proficiency in the learned languages, but to have joined to this a wide and
                    varied culture which had delivered him from the bondage of learned pedantry; in
                    addition to which he is said to have possessed a remarkable talent for
                    communicating knowledge in a clear and interesting manner, and to have exercised
                    a special influence over his pupils’ intellectual and moral tendencies. In
                    December 1573 he was elected to a foundation in his college; in July 1577 he
                    proceeded Μ. A., and in September of the same year he was admitted a fellow. In
                    1579 he was appointed by the chancellor of the university to read the public
                    Hebrew lecture, a duty which he continued to discharge till he left Oxford. Not
                    long after his admission into holy orders, about 1581, he was appointed to
                    preach at St Paul’s Cross; and, according to Walton, he was so kindly
                    entertained by Mrs Churchman, who kept the Shunamite’s house where the preachers
                    were boarded, that he permitted her to choose him a wife, “promising upon a fair
                    summons to return to London and accept of her choice.” The lady selected by her
                    was “her daughter Joan,” who, says the same authority, “found him neither beauty
                    nor portion; and for her conditions they were too like that wife’s which is by
                    Solomon compared to a dripping house.” It is probable that Walton has
                    exaggerated the simplicity and passiveness of Hooker in the matter, but though,
                    as Keble observes with justice, his writings betray uncommon shrewdness and
                    quickness of observation, as well as a vein of keenest humour, it would appear
                    that either gratitude or some other impulse had on this occasion led his
                    judgment astray. After his marriage he was about the end of 1584 presented to
                    the living of Drayton Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire. In the following year he
                    received a visit from his two pupils Edwin Sandys and George Cranmer, who found
                    him with the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of Horace in his hand, tending the
                    sheep while the <pb break="no"

                    the return of the servant accompanied him to his house, “Richard was called to
                    rock the cradle.” . Finding him so engrossed by worldly and domestic cares,
                    “they stayed but till the next morning,” and, greatly grieved at his narrow
                    circumstances and unhappy domestic condition, “left him to the company of his
                    wife Joan.”</p>
                <p>The visit had, however, results of the highest moment, not only in regard to the
                    career of Hooker, but in regard to English literature and English philosophical
                    thought. Sandys prevailed on his father, the archbishop of York, to recommend
                    Hooker for presentation to the mastership of the Temple, and Hooker, though his
                    “wish was rather to gain a better country living,” having agreed after some
                    hesitation to become a candidate, the patent conferring upon him the mastership
                    was granted 17th March 1585. The rival candidate was Walter Travers, a
                    Presbyterian and evening lecturer in the same church. Being continued in the
                    lectureship after the appointment of Hooker, Travers was in the habit of
                    attempting a refutation in the evening of what Hooker had spoken in the morning,
                    Hooker again replying on the following Sunday; so it was said “tho forenoon
                    sermon spake Canterbury, the afternoon Geneva.” On account of the keen feeling
                    displayed by the partisans of both, Archbishop Whitgift deemed it prudent to
                    prohibit the preaching of Travers, whereupon he presented a petition to the
                    council to have the prohibition recalled. Hooker published an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Answer to the Petition of Mr Travers,</hi> and also printed several sermons
                    bearing on special points of the controversy; but, feeling strongly the
                    unsatisfactory nature of such an isolated and fragmentary discussion of separate
                    points, he resolved to compose an elaborate and exhaustive treatise, exhibiting
                    the fundamental principles by which the question in dispute must be decided. It
                    is probable that the work was begun in the latter half of 1586, and he had made
                    considerable progress with it before, with a view to its completion, he
                    petitioned Whitgift to be removed to a country parsonage, in order that, as he
                    said, “I may keep myself in peace and privacy, and behold God’s blessing spring
                    out of my mother earth, and eat my own bread without oppositions.” His desire
                    was granted in 1591 by a presentation to the rectory of Boscombe near Salisbury.
                    There he completed the volume containing the first four of the proposed <hi
                    rend="italic">Eight Books of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</hi> It was
                    entered at Stationers’ Hall, 9th March 1592, but was not published till 1593 or
                    1594. In July 1595 he was promoted by the crown to the rectory of Bishopsbourne
                    near Canterbury, where he lived to see the completion of the fifth book in 1597.
                    In the passage from London to Gravesend some time in 1600 he rønght a severe
                    cold from which he never recovered, but, notwithstanding great weakness and
                    constant suffering, he “was solicitous in his study,” his one desire being “to
                    live to finish the three remaining books of <hi rend="italic">Polity."</hi> His
                    death took place about November of the same year. A volume professing to contain
                    the sixth and eighth books of the <hi rend="italic">Polity</hi> was published at
                    London in 1648, but the bulk of the sixth book, as has been shown by Keble, is
                    an entire deviation from the subject on which Hooker proposed to treat, and
                    doubtless the genuine copy, known to have been completed, has been lost. The
                    seventh book, which was published in a new edition of the work by Gauden in
                    1662, and the eighth book, may be regtrded as in substance the eomposition of
                    Hooker; but, as, in addition to wanting his final revision, they have been very
                    unskilfully edited, if they have not been manipulated for theological purposes,
                    their statements in regard to doubtful matters must be received with due
                    reserve, and no reliance can be placed on their testimony where their meaning
                    contradicts that of other portions of the <hi rend="italic">Polity.</hi></p>
                <p>The conception of Hooker in his later years which wβ form from the various
                    accessible sources is that of a person of low stature and not immediately
                    impressive appearance, much bent by the influence of sedentary and meditative
                    habits, of quiet and retiring manners, and discoloured in complexion and worn
                    and marked in feature from the hard mental toil which he had expended on his
                    great work. There seems, however, exaggeration in Walton’s statement as to the
                    meanness of his dress; and Walton certainly misreads his character when he
                    portrays him as a kind of ascetic mystic. Though he was unworldly and simple in
                    his desires, and engrossed in the purpose to which he had devoted his life,—the
                    “completion of the <hi rend="italic">Polity”—</hi> his writings indicate that he
                    possessed a cheerful and healthy disposition, and that he was capable of
                    discovering enjoyment in everyday pleasures, and of appreciating human life and
                    character in a wide variety of aspects. He seems to have had a special delight
                    in outward nature—as he expressed it, be loved “to see God’s blessing spring out
                    of his mother earth;” and he spent much of his spare time in visiting his
                    parishioners, his deference towards them, if excessive, being yet mingled with a
                    grave dignity which rendered unwarrantable liberties impossible. As a preacher,
                    though singularly devoid of the qualities which win the applause of the
                    multitude, he always excited the interest of the more intelligent, the breadth
                    and finely balanced wisdom of his thoughts and the fascination of his
                    composition greatly modifying the impression produced by his weak voice and
                    ineffective manner. Partly, doubtless, on account of his dimsightedness, he
                    never removed his eye from his manuscript, and, according to Fuller, “he maybe
                    said to have made good music with his fiddle and stick alone, having neither
                    pronunciation nor gesture to grace his matter.”</p>
                <p>To accede without explanation to the claim put forth for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> of Hooker, that it marks an epoch in English prose
                    literature and English thought, would both be to do some-injustice to writers
                    previous to him, and, if not to overestimate his influence, to misinterpret its
                    character. By no means can his excursions in English prose be regarded as
                    chiefly those of a pioneer; and not only is his intellectual position inferior
                    to that of Shakespeare, Spenser, and Bacon,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Paradoxes,</hi> his philosophical standpoint in reference to religion was not

                    it.</p></note> who alone can be properly reckoned as the master spirits of the
                    age, but in reality what effect he may have bad upon the thought of his
                    contemporaries was soon disregarded and swept out of sight in the hand-to-hand
                    struggle with Puritanism, and his influence, so far from being immediate and
                    confined to one particular era, has since the reaction against Puritanism been
                    slowly and imperceptibly permeating and colouring English thought down to the
                    present time. His work is, however, the earliest in English prose with enough of
                    the preserving salt of excellence' to adapt it to the mental palate of modern
                    readers. Attempts more elaborate than those of the old chroniclers had been made
                    two centuries previously to employ English prose both for narrative and for
                    discussion; and, a few years before him, Roger Ascham, Sir Thomas More, Latimer,
                    Sir Philip Sidney, the compilers of the prayer book, and various translators of
                    the Bible had in widely different departments of literature brought to light
                    many samples of the rich wealth of expression that was latent in the language;
                    but Hooker’s is the first independent work in English prose of notable power and
                    genius, and the vigour and grasp of its thought are not more remarkable than the
                    felicity of its literary style. Its more usual and obvious excellences are
                    clearness of expression, notwithstanding occasionally complicated methods; great
                    aptness and conciseness in the formation of individual clauses, and such a fine
                    sense of proportion and rhythm in their arrangement as almost conceals the
                    difficulties of syntax by which he was hampered; finished simplicity,
                    notwithstanding a stateliness too uniform and unbroken; a nice discrimination in
                    the choice of words and phrases, so as both to portray the exact shade of his
                    meaning, and to express each of his thoughts with that degree of emphasis
                    appropriate to its place in his composition. In regard to qualities more
                    relating to the matter than the manner we may note the subtle and partly hidden
                    humour; the strong enthusiasm underlying that seemingly calm and passionless
                    exposition of principles <pb break="no"

                    of temporary disputes, and has earned for him the somewhat misleading epithet of
                    “judicious”; the solidity of learning, not ostentatiously displayed, but
                    indicated in the character and variety of his illustrations and his
                    comprehensive mastery of all that relates to his subject; the breadth of his
                    conceptions, and the sweep and ease of his movements in the highest regions of
                    thought; the fine poetical descriptions occasionally introduced, in which his
                    eloquence attains a grave, rich, and massive harmony that compares not
                    unfavourably with the finest prose of Milton. His manner is, of course,
                    defective in the flexibility and variety characteristic of the best models of
                    English prose literature after the language had been enriched and perfected by
                    long use, and his sentences, constructed too much according to Latin usages, are
                    often tautological and too protracted into long concatenations of clauses; but
                    if, when regarded superficially, his style presents in some respects a stiff and
                    antiquated aspect, it yet possesses an original and innate charm that has
                    retained its freshness after the lapse of nearly three centuries.</p>
                <p>The direct interest in the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> is now
                    philosophical and political rather than theological, for what theological
                    importance it possessed was rather in regard to the spirit and method in which
                    theology should be discussed than in regard to the decision of strictly
                    theological points. Hooker bases his reasoning on principles which he discovered
                    in Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, but the intellectual atmosphere of his age was
                    different from that which surrounded them; he was acted upon by new and more
                    various impulses enabling him to imbibe more thoroughly the spirit of Greek
                    thought which was the source of their inspiration, and thus to reach a higher
                    and freer region than scholasticism, and in a sense to inaugurate modern
                    philosophy in England. It may be admitted that his principles are only partially
                    and in some degree capriciously wrought out,—that if he is not under the
                    dominion of intellectual tendencies leading to opposite results there are
                    occasional blanks and gaps in his argument where he seems sometimes to be
                    groping after a meaning which he cannot fully grasp; but he is often charged
                    with obscurity simply because readers of various theological schools, beholding
                    in his principles what seem the outline and justification of their own ideas,
                    are disappointed when they find that these outlines instead of acquiring as they
                    narrowly examine them the full and definite form of their anticipations, widen
                    out into a region beyond their notions and sympathies, and therefore from their
                    point of view enveloped in mist and shade. It is the exposition of philosophical
                    principles in the first and second books of the <hi rend="italic">Polity,</hi>
                    and not the application of these principles in the remaining books that gives
                    the work its standard place in English literature. It was intended to be an
                    answer to the attacks of the Presbyterians on the Episcopalian polity and
                    customs, but no attempt is made directly to oust Presbyterianism from the place
                    it then held in the Church of England. The work must rather be regarded as a
                    remonstrance against the narrow ground chosen by the Presbyterians for their
                    basis of attack, Hooker’s exact position being that “a necessity of polity and
                    regiment may be held in all churches without holding any form to be necessary.”
                    The general purpose of his reasoning is to vindicate Episcopacy from objections
                    that had been urged against it, but he attains a result which has other and
                    wider consequences than this. The fundamental principle on which he bases his
                    reasoning is the unity and all-embracing character of law—law “whose seat,” he
                    beautifully says, “is the bosom of God, whose voice the harmony of the world.”
                    Law—as operative in nature, as regulating each man’s individual character and
                    actions, as seen in the formations of societies and governments—is equally a
                    manifestation and development of the divine order according to which God Himself
                    acts, is the expression in various forms of the divine reason. He makes a
                    distinction between natural and positive laws, the one being eternal and
                    immutable, the other varying according to external necessity and expediency; and
                    he includes all the forms of government under laws that are positive and
                    therefore alterable according to circumstances. Their application is to be
                    determined by reason, reason enlightened and strengthened by every variety of
                    knowledge, discipline, and experience. The leading feature in his system fs the
                    high place assigned to reason, for, though affirming that certain truths
                    necessary to salvation could be made known only by special divine revelation, he
                    yet elevates reason into the criterion by which these truths are to be judged,
                    and the standard to determine what in revelation is temporal and what eternal.
                    “It is not the word of God itself,” he says, “which doth or possibly can assure
                    us that we do well to think it His word.” At the same time he saves himself from
                    the dangers of abstract and rash theorizing by a deep and absolute regard for
                    facts, the diligent and accurate study of which he makes of the first importance
                    to the proper use of reason. “The general and perpetual voice of men is,’’ he
                    says, “as the sentence of God Himself. For that which all men have at all times
                    learned, nature herself must needs have taught; and, God being the author of
                    nature, her voice is but His instrument.” Applying his principles to man
                    individually, the foundation of morality is, according to Hooker, immutable, and
                    rests “on that law which God from the beginning hath set Himself to do all
                    things by;” this law is to be discovered by reason; and the perfection which
                    reason teaches us to strive after is stated, with characteristic breadth of
                    conception and regard to the facts of human nature, to be “a triple perfection:
                    first a sensual, consisting in those things which very life itself requireth,
                    either as necessary supplements, or as beauties or ornaments thereof; then an
                    intellectual, consisting in those things which none underneath man is either
                    capable of or acquainted with; lastly, a spiritual or divine, consisting in
                    those things whereunto we tend by supernatural means here, but cannot here
                    attain unto them.” Applying his principles to man as a member of a community, he
                    assigns practically the same origin and sanctions to ecclesiastical as to civil
                    government. His theory of government forms the basis of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on Civil Government</hi> by Locke, although Locke developed the theory
                    in a way that Hooker would not have sanctioned. The force and justification of
                    government Hooker derives from public approbation, either given directly by the
                    parties immediately concerned, or indirectly through inheritance from their
                    ancestors. “Sith men,” he says, “naturally have no full and perfect power to
                    command whole politic multitudes of men, therefore utterly without our consent
                    we could in such sort be at no man’s commandment living. And to be commanded we
                    do consent, when that society whereof we are part hath at any time before
                    consented, without revoking the same after, by the like universal agreement.”
                    His theory as he stated it is in various of its aspects and applications liable
                    to objection; but taken as a whole it is the first philosophical statement of
                    the principles which, though disregarded in the succeeding age, have since
                    regulated political progress in England, and gradually modified its constitution
                    into its present form. One of the corollaries of his principles, his theory of
                    the relation of church and state, according to which, with the qualifications
                    implied in his theory of government, he asserts the royal supremacy in matters
                    of religion, and identifies the church and commonwealth as but different aspects
                    of the same government, has not met with such general approval, but practically
                    it is the theory of the ablest defenders of state churches at the present
                    time.</p>
                <p>A life of Hooker by Dr Gauden was published in his edition of Hooker's works,
                    London, 1662. To correct the errors in this life walton wrote another, which was
                    published in the 2d edition of Hooker's works in 1666. The standard modern
                    edition of Hooker's works is that by Kehle, which first appeared in 1836, and
                    has since been several times reprinted. The first book of the Laics of
                    Ecclesiastical Polity has been edited for the “Clarendon Press Series," by
                    1&lt;. W. Church, Μ.A. (1868). (T. F. H.)</p>
