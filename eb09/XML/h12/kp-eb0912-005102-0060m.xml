                    name from the territory of Hohenlohe in Franconia, which, originally a countship
                    and afterwards a principality, lost its independence in 1806, and is now
                    included partly in Wiirteinberg and partly in Bavaria. They are first mentioned
                    as possessing in the 12th century the castle of Holloch near Llffenheim. At an
                    early period they extended their influence into several of the Franconian
                    valleys, including those of the Kocher, the Jagst, the Tauber, and the Gotlach.
                    The first count of the name was Gottfried, who was on terms of intimacy with the
                    emperor Henry VI., and whose sons founded the lines of Hohenlohe-Bruneck and
                    Hohenlohe-Holloch. The former became extinct in the fourth generation, and the
                    latter in 1340 divided into the lines of Hohenlohe-Hohenlohe and
                    Hohenlohe-Speckfeld. Of these the former became extinct in 1412, after the most
                    of the possessions had been alienated through the marriage of the female heir;
                    and the latter in 1551 divided into the present lines of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein
                    and Hohenlohe-Waldenburg, which were elevated, the former in 1764 and the latter
                    in 1744, to principalities of the empire. Hohenlohe-Neuenstein, which adopted
                    Protestantism, became divided into the lines Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Oehringen and
                    Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Langenburg, the former of which separated into the branches
                    of Hohenlohe-Weickersheim and Hohenlohe-Oehringen, the one becoming extinct in
                    1756 and the other in 1805, after which their possessions were inherited by the
                    Hohenlohe-Neuenstein-Langenburg line, which latter became divided into three
                    branches—the Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Hohenlohe-Langenburg-Oehringen, and the
                    Hohenlohe-Langenburg-Kirchberg, the last becoming extinct in 1861. The line of
                    Hohenlohe-Waldenburg, which remained Catholic, and in which was established in
                    1754 the order of the Phoenix, divided itself into two branches, the
                    Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein and the Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schdlingsfürst,
                    the former subdividing into the branches of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein and
                    Hohenlohe-Jagstberg. Of the Hohenlohe family the following members are noted as
                    having attained individual eminence.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Friedrich Ludwig</hi> (1746-1818), prince of
                    Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, a Prussian general, was born 31st January 1746. Entering
                    the Prussian service at an early age he became colonel in 1788, and in the
                    campaigns of 1792 and 1793, where he was commander of a division, he
                    distinguished himself in several engagements. In 179 4 he gained a brilliant
                    victory at Kaiserslautern, and in 1796 he was promoted lieutenant-general and
                    appointed to the command of the army of the Ems. In the same year he succeeded
                    to the principality of his father. Having been appointed general of infantry in
                    1800, he in 1805 commanded a Prussian corps between the Saale and the Thuringian
                    Forest. He was severely defeated at Jena in 1806, and after the duke of
                    Brunswick was mortally wounded at Auerstädt, he succeeded to the chief command,
                    and led to the Oder the fragments of the Prussian army which capitulated at
                    Prenzlau on the 28th October. On account of the blame to which this disaster
                    exposed him, he had to retire from the army. He died at Slawentzitz, Silesia,
                    15th February 1818.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ludwig</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Aloysius</hi>
                    (1765-1829), prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein, marshal and peer of
                    France, was born 18th August 1765. In 1784 he entered the service of the
                    palatinate, which he quitted in 1792 in order to take the command of a regiment
                    raised by his father for the service of the emigrant princes of France. He
                    greatly distinguished himself under Prince Condé in the campaigns of 1792-1793,
                    especially at the storming of the lines of Weissenburg. Subsequently he entered
                    the service of Holland, and, when almost surrounded by the army of General
                    Pichegru, conducted a masterly retreat from the island of Bommnel. From 1794 to
                    1799 he served as colonel in the Austrian campaigns; in 1799 he was named
                    major-general by the archduke Charles; and after obtaining the rank of
                    lieutenant-general he wasappointed by the emperor of Austria governor of the two
                    Galicias. Napoleon offered to restore to him his principality on condition that
                    he adhered to the confederation of the Rhine, but as he refused, it was united
                    to Würtemberg. After Napoleon’s fall in 1814 he entered the French service, and
                    in 1815 he held the command of a regiment raised by himself, with which he took
                    part in the Spanish campaign of 1823. In 1827 he was created marshal and peer of
                    France. He died at Lunéville, May 30, 1829.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander Leopold Franz Emmerich</hi> (1794— 1849),
                    prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst, priest and reputed
                    miracle-worker, was born at Kupferzell near Waldenburg, 17th August 1794. By his
                    mother, the daughter of an Hungarian nobleman, he was from infancy destined for
                    the church; and she entrusted the care of his early education to the ex-Jesuit
                    Riel. In 1804 he entered <pb break="no"

                    at Bern, in 1810 the archiépiscopal seminary at Vienna, and afterwards he
                    studied at Tyrnau and Ellwangen. He was ordained priest in 1815, and in the
                    following year he went to Rome, where he entered the society of the “Fathers of
                    the Sacred Heart.” Subsequently, at Munich and Bamberg, he was blamed for J
                    esuit and obscurantist tendencies, but obtained considerable reputation as a
                    preacher. His first so-called miraculous cure was effected, in conjunction with
                    a peasant Martin Michel, on a princess of Schwarzenberg who had been for some
                    years paralytic. Immediately he acquired such fame as a performer of miraculous
                    cures that multitudes from various countries flocked to partake of the
                    beneficial influence of his supposed supernatural gifts. Ultimately, on account
                    of the interference of the authorities with his operations, he went in 1821 tρ
                    Vienna and then to Hungary, where he became canon at Grosswardein, and in 1844
                    titular bishop of Sardica. He died at Vöslau near Vienna, 17th November 1849. He
                    was the author of a number of ascetic and controversial writings, which were
                    collected and published in one edition by Brunner at Ratisbon in 1851.</p>
