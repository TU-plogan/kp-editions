                <p><label type="entry">HOOGHLY</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hùgli.</hi> The
                    Hooghly river is the most westerly and commercially the most important channel
                    by which the Ganges enters the Bay of Bengal. It takes its distinctive name near
                    the town of Sântipur, about 120 miles from the sea. The stream now known as the
                    Hooghly represents three western deltaic distributaries of the Ganges —viz., (1)
                    the Bhagirathi, (2) the Jalangi, and (3) part of the Mâtâbhângâ. The Bhâgirathi
                    and Jalangi unite at Nadiyâ, above the point of their junction with the lower
                    waters of the Mâtâbhângâ, which has taken the name of the Churni before the
                    point of junction and thrown out new distributaries of its own. These three
                    western distributaries are known as “The Nadiyâ Rivers,” and are important, not
                    only as great highways for internal traffic, but also as the headwaters of the
                    Hooghly. Like other deltaic distributaries, they are subject to sudden changes
                    in their channels, and to constant silting up. The supervising and keeping open
                    of the Nadiyâ rivers has, therefore, formed one of the great tasks of fluvial
                    engineering in Bengal. Proceeding south from Sântipur, with a twist to the east,
                    the Hooghly river divides Murshidâbâd from Hooghly district, until it touches
                    the district of the Twenty-Four Parganâs in 22° 57 ’ 30" N. lat. and 88° 27' 15"
                    E. long. It then proceeds almost due south to Calcutta, next twists to the
                    south-west, and finally turns south, entering the Bay of Bengal in 21° 41' N.
                    lat. and 88° E. long.</p>
                <p>In the 40 miles of its course that are above Calcutta, the channels of the
                    Hooghly are under no supervision, and the result is that they have silted up and
                    shifted to such an extent as to be no longer navigable for sea-going ships. Yet
                    it was upon this upper section that all the famous ports of Bengal lay in olden
                    times. From Calcutta to the sea (about 80 miles) the river is a record of
                    engineering improvement and success. A minute supervision, with steady dredging
                    and constant readjustment of buoys, now renders it a safe waterway to Calcutta
                    for ships of the largest tonnage. Much attention has also been paid to the port
                    of Calcutta. For its trade, shipping, and administration, see <hi

                <p>Tl∣e tide runs rapidly on the Hooghly, and produces a remarkable example of the
                    fluvial phenomenon known as a “bore.” This consists of the headwave of the
                    advancing tide, hemmed in where the estuary narrows suddenly into the river, and
                    often exceeds 7 feet in height. It is felt as high up as Calcutta, and
                    frequently sinks small boats or dashes them to pieces on the bank. The
                    difference from the lowest point of low-water in the dry season to the highest
                    point of high-water in the rains is reported at 20 feet 10 inches. The greatest
                    mean rise of tide, about 16 feet, takes place in March, April, or May,—with a
                    declining range during the rainy season to a mean of 10 feet, and a minimum
                    during freshets of 3 feet 6 inches. The scenery on the banks of the Hooghly
                    varies greatly. The sea approach presents nothing to view but sandbanks,
                    succeeded by mean-looking mud formations covered with coarse grass. As the river
                    narrows, however, the country improves. Trees and rice fields and villages are
                    common, and at length a section is reached where the banks are high, and lined
                    with hamlets buried under evergreen groves. Then come long tiers of shipping,
                    with the stately painted mansions of Garden Reach on the margin in the
                    foreground, the fort rising from the great plain on the bank higher up, and the
                    domes, steeples, and noble public buildings of Calcutta beyond,— all gradually
                    unfolding their beauties in a long panorama.</p>
