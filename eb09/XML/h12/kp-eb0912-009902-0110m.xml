                    difficulty saved from the flames which destroyed the splendid family mansion in
                    which he was born. When little more than a year old he succeeded, through the
                    death of his father, to the peerage. On the death of his mother in his fifth
                    year, the care of his early education nominally devolved upon her brother, the
                    earl of Upper Ossory, but the character of his early training and studies was
                    determined chiefly by his uncle Charles James Fox, of whom he wrote—“He seemed
                    to take pleasure in awakening my ambition, and directing it both by conversation
                    and correspondence, and yet more by talking to me of my studies and inspiring me
                    with a love of poetry both ancient and modern.” After spending eight or nine
                    years at Eton, where he had as contemporaries J. Hookham Frere, Mr Canning, and
                    Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle, he in 1790 entered Christ Church
                    College, Oxford. Though the years of his early manhood were occupied more in
                    amusement than in study, he acquired at school and the university a taste for
                    classical literature which he more fully cultivated in after life. Before taking
                    his seat in the House of Lords, he made two tours on the Continent,—in 1791,
                    while still a student at Oxford, visiting Paris about the time when Louis XVI.
                    accepted the revolutionary constitution; and in 1793 making a prolonged stay in
                    Spain, where he began the study of its language and literature. Thence he went
                    in 1795 to Italy; and at Florence he formed the acquaintance of Lady Webster,
                    wife of Sir Godfrey Webster, whom after her divorce from her husband —who
                    received £6000 damages in the action against Lord Holland—he married in 1797.
                    After the marriage he assumed his wife’s family name of Vassall, but its use was
                    discontinued by his son, the fourth and last Lord Holland.</p>
                <p>Lord Holland’s early inheritance of a peerage must be regarded rather as a
                    misfortune than an advantage, for it debarred him from a career in the House of
                    Commons which might have proved as brilliant as that of his uncle Charles Fox,
                    and raised him to an assembly, not only more listless and much less numerous,
                    but where at the time he entered it the Whig party, of whose principles the
                    influence of his uncle had induced him to become a strenuous supporter, could
                    muster only a minority of six or seven in a house of eighty or ninety. He began
                    his political career <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0111-0100"/> by a motion against the Assessed Tax Bill, and
                    though his speech had, as was to be expected, no influence on the division, it
                    proved that he had inherited the oratorical abilities of his family, and pointed
                    him out as the leader of his uncle’s supporters in the Upper House. As his
                    disapproval of most of the proceedings of the House of Lords was recorded by
                    protests, his copiousness in this species of composition has perhaps never been
                    equalled. These protests were afterwards collected and published by D. C. Moylan
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">The Opinions of Lord Holland as recorded in
                    the Journals of the House of Lords, from</hi> 1797 <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    1841 (London, 1841), and, besides constituting, as they necessarily do, a full
                    though condensed account of his political views and opinions, form one of the
                    most authentic and original records of the course of Whig policy during the
                    years to which they refer. After the peace of Amiens in 1802 Lord Holland
                    proceeded to Paris, whence he went to Spain, staying in that country until the
                    declaration of war in January 1805, when he returned to England. Of this second
                    visit to Spain he doubtless took advantage for the purpose of acquiring a more
                    complete mastery of the Spanish language and literature, and the fruit of this
                    was seen by the publication in 1807 of <hi rend="italic">The Life and Writings
                    of Lope Felix de Vega Carpio,</hi> and in 1808 of <hi rend="italic">Three
                    Comedies from the Spanish.</hi> When the ministry of “All the Talents” came into
                    office in 1806, Lord Holland was made a privy councillor, and was appointed
                    along with Lord Auckland to negotiate with the American plenipotentiaries that
                    treaty the refusal of whose ratification by Mr Jefferson resulted in the
                    subsequent war with America. On the death of Mr Fox, 15th October following,
                    Lord Holland received the privy seal, holding office till the dismissal of the
                    ministry in 1807. When the Spaniards rebelled against the French yoke in 1808,
                    Lord Holland’s interest in the country induced him to pay it a third visit. He
                    landed at Corunna almost simultaneously with the division of the British army
                    under Sir David Baird, and did not return to England till the close of 1809.
                    During the long period when the Whigs were excluded from power Lord Holland
                    continued to afford them his strenuous and steady support. He did not join the
                    Canning ministry of 1827, but when the Whigs were recalled in 1830 he became
                    chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, an office which, with the exception of two
                    short intervals when his party were temporarily excluded from power, he
                    continued to hold till his death at Holland House, 22d October 1840.</p>
                <p>Although Lord Holland for the greater period of his life had to lead the forlorn
                    hope of his party in the House of Lords, his influence on the politics of his
                    country was of an importance far beyond what was manifest at the time, and
                    without his persistent support in parliament and his aid in maintaining his
                    party’s courage and discipline, the triumph of many of the measures he advocated
                    would in all probability not have been so speedy and complete. Few have been
                    more closely identified with all the great political changes of the first half
                    of the present century, more especially the extension of the suffrage, the
                    abrogation of Catholic disabilities, the abolition of the Test and Corporation
                    Acts, the repeal of the corn laws, and the repression of the slave trade. A
                    sympathizer with the French Revolution, he differed from his party in his
                    admiration and esteem for Napoleon, against whose imprisonment he protested as
                    an outrageous violation both of good faith and of what was due to fallen
                    greatness. The character of Lord Holland’s oratory very closely resembled that
                    of his uncle Charles Fox, and was inferior to it only perhaps because his
                    natural indolence was not counteracted by the stimulus of a popular assembly
                    encouraging him to a more careful study of the art of eloquence, and affording
                    him more adequate opportunities for its display. He excelled principally in
                    close reasoning rendered clear and easy of apprehension by copious illustration,
                    and—as was to be expected from the fact that he trusted little to previous
                    preparation—was more happy in reply than in original statement. The effect of
                    the best passages of his speeches was often marred by a more aggravated form of
                    that tendency to hesitation which was one of the principal oratorical defects of
                    Fox, the rush of ideas seeming to be too rapid to permit him to select with ease
                    from his copious vocabulary the word most appropriate for his purpose. According
                    to Lord Brougham—“The same delicate sense of humour which distinguished Mr Fox
                    he also showed, and much of the exquisite Attic wit which formed so large and so
                    effective a portion of that great orator’s argumentation, never uselessly
                    introduced, always adapted nicely to the occasion, always aiding and as it were
                    directing the reasoning.” The language both of his spoken and written style was
                    graceful, pure, flowing, aud vigorous, and entirely devoid of extravagance,
                    singularity, or affectation. In addition to his poetical translations, he was
                    the author of fugitive verses of some elegance. Two of his works were published
                    posthumously by his son Henry Edward, fourth Lord Holland <hi rend="italic"
                    >—Foreign Reminiscences</hi> (1850), and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Whig
                    Party during my Time</hi> (2 vols. 1852-54).</p>
                <p>It is, however, as the restorer of Holland House, and as the host of the
                    brilliant company which he there assembled, that Lord Holland in all probability
                    will be chiefly remembered by posterity. Though his temper was quick and
                    excitable, his amiable disposition rendered his manners in private uniformly
                    cordial and engaging. His conversation, easy, unconstrained, and of great
                    variety both as to manner and matter, was enlivened by a peculiarly genial wit,
                    and a never-failing supply of racy anecdote to which his powers of mimicry gave
                    additional point and zest. The width of his sympathies and his manifold
                    acquirements enabled him to enjoy the society of persons of every species of
                    intellectual eminence. Holland House, which owes its name to Henry Rich, first
                    earl of Holland,—who was no relation of the Fox family,—and which had been
                    afterwards the home of Addison and of other tenants of various kinds of
                    distinction, was restored by Lord Holland in a manner worthy of the company of
                    European statesmen, artists, and men of letters, of which it became the common
                    meetingplace. Much of the attraction of these brilliant gatherings was due to
                    the management and personal influence of Lady Holland, who had the peculiar gift
                    of making herself both feared and fascinating at the same time. Of her the
                    Princess Liechtenstein writes—“Beautiful, clever, and well-informed, she
                    exercised a natural authority over those around her. But a habit of
                    contradiction—which, it is fair to add, she did not mind being reciprocated upon
                    herself—occasionally lent animation, not to say animosity, to the arguments in
                    which she engaged. It is easy for some natures to say a disagreeable thing, but
                    it is not always easy to carry a disagreeable thing off cleverly. This Lady
                    Holland could do.”</p>
