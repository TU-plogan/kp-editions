                    and <hi rend="italic">τροφή,</hi> nourishment), a term in medicine employed to
                    designate an abnormal increase in bulk of one or more of the organs or component
                    tissues of the body. In its strict sense this term can only be applied where the
                    increase affects the natural textures of a part, and is not applicable where the
                    enlargement is due to the presence of some extraneous morbid formation.
                    Hypertrophy of a part may manifest itself either by simply an increase in the
                    size of its constituents, or by this combined with an increase in their number
                    (hyperplasia). In many instances both are associated.</p>
                <p>The conditions giving rise to hypertrophy are the reverse of those already
                    described as producing <hi rend="smallcaps">Atrophy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> They are concisely stated by Sir James Paget as being chiefly or
                    only three, namely:—(1) the increased exercise of a part in its healthy
                    functions; (2) an increased accumulation in the blood of the particular
                    materials which a part appropriates to its nutrition or in secretion; and (3) an
                    increased afflux of healthy blood.</p>
                <p>Illustrations are furnished of the first of these conditions by the high
                    development of muscular tissue under habitual active exercise of the second in
                    the case of obesity, which is an hypertrophy of the fatty tissues, the elements
                    of which are furnished by the blood; and of the third in the occasional
                    overgrowth of hair in the neighbourhood of parts which are the seat of
                    inflammation. Obviously therefore, in many instances, hypertrophy cannot be
                    regarded as a deviation from health, but rather on the contrary as indicative of
                    a high degree of nutrition and physical power. Even in those cases where it is
                    found associated with disease, it is often produced as a salutary effort of
                    nature to compensate for obstructions or other difficulties which have arisen in
                    the system, and thus to ward off evil consequences. No better example of this
                    can be seen than in the case of certain forms of heart disease, where from
                    defect at some of the natural orifices of that organ the onward flow of the
                    blood is interfered with, and would soon give rise to serious embarrassment to
                    the circulation, were it not that behind the seat of obstruction the heart
                    gradually becomes hypertrophied, and thus acquires greater propelling power to
                    overcome the resistance in front. Again, it has been noticed, in the case of
                    certain double organs such as the kidneys, that when one has been destroyed by
                    disease the other has become hypertrophied to such a degree as enables it to
                    discharge the functions of both.</p>
                <p>Hypertrophy may, however, in certain circumstances constitute a disease, as in
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Goitre</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Elephantiasis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and also in the case of certain tumours and growths
                    (such as cutaneous excrescences, fatty tumours, mucous polypi, &lt;fcc.), which
                    are simply enlargements of normal textures. Hypertrophy does not in all cases
                    involve an increase in bulk; for, just as in atrophy there may be no diminution
                    in the size of the affected organ, so in hypertrophy there may be no increase.
                    This is apt to be the case where certain only of the elements of an organ
                    undergo increase, while the others remain unaffected or are actually atrophied
                    by the pressure of the hypertrophied tissue, as is seen in the disease known as
                    cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
                <p>A spurious sort of hypertrophy is observed in the rare disease to which Μ.
                    Duchenne has applied the name of <hi rend="italic">pseudo-hypertrophic
                    paralysis.</hi> This ailment, which appears to be confined to children, consists
                    essentially of a progressive loss of power accompanied with a remarkable
                    enlargement of certain muscles or groups of muscles, more rarely of the whole
                    muscular system. This increase of bulk is, however, not a true hypertrophy, but
                    rather an excessive development of connective tissue in the substance of the
                    muscles, the proper texture of which tends in consequence to undergo atrophy or
                    degeneration. The appearance presented by a child suffering from this disease is
                    striking. The attitude and gait are remarkably altered, the child standing with
                    shoulders thrown back, small of the back deeply curved inwards, and legs wide
                    apart, while walking is accompanied with a peculiar swinging or rocking
                    movement. The calves of the legs, the buttocks, the muscles of the back, and
                    occasionally other muscles, are seen to be unduly enlarged, and contrast
                    strangely with the general feebleness. The progress of the disease is marked by
                    increasing failure of locomotory power, and ultimately by complete paralysis of
                    the limbs. The malady is little amenable to treatment, and, although often
                    prolonged for years, generally proves fatal before the period of maturity.</p>
