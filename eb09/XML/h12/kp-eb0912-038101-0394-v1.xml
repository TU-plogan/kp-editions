                    under a leader named Balamir (or, according to some MSS., Balamber) they began a
                    westward movement from their settlements in the steppes lying to the north of
                    the Caspian. After crushing, or compelling the alliance of, various nations
                    unknown to fame (Alpilzuri, Alcidzuri, Himari, Tuncarsi, Boisci), they at length
                    reached the Alani, a powerful nation which had its seat between the Volga and
                    the Don; these also, after a struggle, they defeated and finally enlisted in
                    their service. They then proceeded, after a short interval, in 374 to invade the
                    empire of the Ostrogoths (Greuthungi), ruled over by the aged Ermanaric, or
                    Hermanric, who died (perhaps by his own hand) while the critical attack was
                    still impending. Under his son Hunimund a section of his subjects promptly made
                    a humiliating peace; under Withemir (Winithar), however, who succeeded him in
                    the larger part of his dominions, an armed resistance was organized; but it
                    resulted only in repeated defeat, and finally in the death of the king. The
                    representatives of his son Witheric put an end to the conflict by accepting the
                    condition of vassalage. Balamir now directed his victorious arms still further
                    westward against that portion of the Visigothic nation (or Tervingi) which
                    acknowledged the authority of Athanaric. The latter entrenched himself on the
                    frontier which had separated him from the Ostrogoths, behind the
                    “Greutung-rampart” and the Dniester; but notwithstanding all his precautions he
                    was surprised by the enemy, who forded the river in the night, fell suddenly
                    upon his camp, and compelled him to abandon his position. Athanaric next
                    attempted to establish himself in the territory between the Pruth and the
                    Danube, and with this object set about heightening the old Roman wall which
                    Trajan had erected in north-eastern Dacia; before his fortifications, however,
                    were complete, the Huns were again upon him, and without a battle he was forced
                    to retreat to the Danube. The remainder of the Visigoths, under Alavivus and
                    Fritigern, now began to seek and ultimately were successful in obtaining (376)
                    the permission of the emperor Valens to settle in Thrace; Athanaric meanwhile
                    took refuge in Transylvania, thus abandoning the field without any serious
                    struggle to the irresistible Huns. For more than fifty years the Roman world was
                    undisturbed by any aggressive act on the part of the new invaders, who contented
                    themselves with overpowering various other tribes which Jived to the north of
                    the Danube. In some instances, in fact, the Huns actually lent their aid to the
                    Romans against third parties; thus in 404-5 certain Hunnic tribes, under a chief
                    or king named Uldin, assisted Honorius in the struggle with Radagaisus (Ratigar)
                    and his Ostrogoths, and took a prominent part in the decisive battle which was
                    fought in the neighbourhood of Florence. Once indeed, in 409, they are said to
                    have crossed the Danube and invaded Bulgaria under perhaps the same chief
                    (Uldis), but extensive desertions soon compelled a retreat. About the year 432,
                    a noteworthy Hunnic king, Ruas or Rugulas, is mentioned, who made himself of
                    such importance that he received from Theodosius II. an annual stipend or
                    tribute of 350 pounds of gold (£14,000), along with the rank of Roman
                    general.</p>
                <p>Quarrels soon arose, partly out of the circumstance that the Romans had sought to
                    make alliances with certain Danubian tribes which Ruas chose to regard as
                    properly subject to himself, partly also because some of the undoubted subjects
                    of the Hun had sought and found refuge on Roman territory; and Theodosius, in
                    reply to an indignant and insulting message which he had received about this
                    cause of dispute, was preparing to send off a special embassy when tidings
                    arrived that Ruas was dead, and that he had been succeeded in his kingdom by
                    Attila and Bleda, the two sons of his brother Mundzuk (433). Shortly afterwards
                    the treaty of Margus (not far from the modern Belgrade), where both sides
                    negotiated on horseback, was ratified. By its stipulations the yearly stipendium
                    or tribute payable to Attila by the Romans was doubled; the fugitives were to be
                    surrendered, or a fine of £8 to be paid for each of those who should be missing;
                    free markets, open to Hun and Roman alike, were to be instituted; and any tribe
                    with which Attila might be at any time at war was thereby to be held as excluded
                    from alliance with Rome. For eight years afterwards there was peace so far as
                    the Romans were concerned; and during this period probably it was that the Huns
                    proceeded to the extensive conquests to which the contemporary historian Priscus
                    so vaguely alludes in the words :—“He (Attila) has made the whole of Scythia his
                    own, he has laid the Roman empire under tribute, and he thinks of renewing his
                    attacks upon Persia. The road to that eastern kingdom is not untrodden by the
                    Huns; already they have marched fifteen days from a certain lake, and have
                    ravaged Media.” They also appear before the end of this interval to have pushed
                    westward as far as to the Rhone, and to have come into conflict with the
                    Burgundians. Overt acts of hostility, however, occurred against the Eastern
                    empire when the town of Margus (by the treachery of its bishop) was seized and
                    sacked (441), and against the Western when Sirmium was invested and taken. In
                    445 Bleda died, and two years afterwards Attila, now sole ruler, undertook one
                    of his most important expeditions against the Eastern empire; on this occasion
                    he pushed southwards as far as Thermopylae, Gallipoli, and the walls of
                    Constantinople; peace was cheaply purchased by tripling the yearly tribute
                    (which accordingly now stood at 2100 pounds of gold, or £84,000 sterling) and by
                    the payment of a heavy indemnity besides. In 448 again occurred various
                    diplomatic negotiations, and especially the embassy of Maximin, of which many
                    curious details have been recorded by Priscus his companion. Then followed, in
                    451, that westward movement across the Rhine which was only arrested at last,
                    with terrible slaughter, on the Catalaunian plains (according to common belief,
                    in the neighbourhood of the modern Châlons, but more probably at a point some
                    fifty miles to the south-east, near Mery-sur-Seine). The following year (452),
                    that of the Italian campaign, was marked by such events as the sack of Aquileia,
                    the destruction of the cities of Venetia, and finally, on the banks of the
                    Mincio, that historical interview with Pope Leo I. which resulted in the return
                    of Attila to Pannonia, where in 453 he died (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Attila).</hi> Almost immediately afterwards, the empire he had amassed
                    rather than consolidated fell to pieces. His too numerous sons began to quarrel
                    about their inheritance, while Ardaric, the king of the Gepidae, was placing
                    himself at the head of a general revolt of the dependent nations. The inevitable
                    struggle came to a crisis near the river Netad in Pannonia, in a battle in which
                    30,000 of the Huns and their confederates, including Ellak, Attila’s eldest son,
                    were slain. The nation, thus broken, rapidly dispersed; one horde settled under
                    Roman protection in Little Scythia (the Dobrudscha), others in Dacia Ripensis
                    (on the confines of Servia and <pb break="no"

                    Pannonia. The main body, however, appear to have resumed the position on the
                    steppes of the river Ural which they had left less than a century before; soon
                    afterwards they reappear in history as the Bulgari (see Zeuss,D⅛ <hi
                        rend="italic">Deutschen,</hi> &amp;c., p. 710), divided into two sections,
                    the Kuturguιi and the less formidable Uturguri, who for morethan seventy years
                    (485-557) were a constant source of annoyance and danger to the Eastern empire,
                    until they themselves fell under the rising power of the Avars. About the year
                    630 they succeeded in regaining their independence, under the leadership of a
                    chief named Krobat, or more properly Kubrat, a person of great consequence, who
                    made a treaty with the emperor Heraclius. After his death his dominions,
                    according to Theophanes (who wrote about 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi>
                    were divided among his five sons, of whom the eldest, Batbaias, remained with
                    his own people near the Maeotis, while the third, Asperuch, crossed the Danube.
                    At a later period the first of these divisions came into close relations with
                    the Khazars on the Volga, and their territory is spoken of as Great Bulgaria;
                    for a brief account of the Danubian or “White” Bulgarians the article <hi

                    consulted.</p>
                <p>We have no adequate philological data for conclusively determining the
                    ethnological position of the ancient Huns; and, in the attempt to solve the
                    problem by other means, the student is at all points much hampered by the
                    vagueness and inaccuracy with which designations, apparently ethnological, are
                    applied by ancient writers. Since the publication of the <hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">Occidentaux</hi> of De Guignes (1756-58), it has been usual to
                    identify the first mentioned with the Heungnoo or Hiungnu, a people who, about
                    the end of the 3d century B.C., according to the Chinese annals, constituted a
                    powerful empire extending from the Great Wall of China to the Caspian, but who,
                    gra' dually falling into a state of anarchy, ultimately succumbed to the attacks
                    of their enemies towards the close of the 1st Christian century. Their
                    subsequent history is very obscure; but it appears that one section of them fled
                    westward and settled in the neighbourhood of the Ural river, and the extremely
                    tempting hypothesis of De Guignes is that these were the direct ancestors of the
                    Huns, who three centuries afterwards began, under Balamir, to exercise so
                    formidable an influence on the affairs of Europe. If so, then the Huns in all
                    probability belonged to the Turkish branch of the great Turanian race.</p>
                <p>According to the totally distinct line of investigation followed by Roesler,
                    however, the Bulgarians, and therefore the Huns whose descendants they were, are
                    to be regarded as of Finnic origin (see <hi rend="italic">Romanische
                        Studien,</hi> p. 231 <hi rend="italic">sqq.').</hi> It has only to be added
                    that by mediaeval writers, both Byzantine and Western, the word Hun is used much
                    as the word Scythian was used by the ancients, with the utmost generality. No
                    very close connexion can be made out between the Huns and the Magyars (Oκγγpot,
                    Ugri, Wengri, Ungri, Ungäri, Hungari), who first became prominent about the 9th
                    century and who were undoubtedly Finns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> The contemporary authorities upon the subject
                    of the Huns during the period of their greatest ascendency in Europe are the
                    fragments of the eight books of the rhetorician Priscus, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Concerning Byzantium and the Occurrences connected with Attila,</hi> with
                    the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus the Roman soldier, and of Jordanis the
                    Gothic bishop. The account of the Huns given by the last-named must always be
                    read in the light of the fact that as a Goth he could hardly avoid giving a
                    somewhat exaggerated picture of the great military power in the presence of
                    which his own people had been able to show so little resistance. The truth of
                    the somewhat elaborate sketch of the Huns by Ammianus has sometimes been
                    doubted, but careful examination tends rather to establish its claim to be
                    regarded aS trustworthy. After alluding to their portentous ugliness (of which,
                    however, the only features he specifies are the round shoulders and the scarred
                    beardless cheeks), he proceeds to mention some of the habits which in his
                    opinion stamp them as surpassing all other barbarians in rudeness of life. Their
                    food, in addition to such roots as they are able to find, consists of the
                    half-raw flesh of any sort of animal, prepared for use by being carried for some
                    time between their persons and the backs of the hardy little horses which are
                    their almost inseparable companions. Houses they have none; and their clothing,
                    which is made partly of linen and partly of the skins of field mice sewed
                    together, continues to be worn until it falls to pieces. Their weapons are
                    javelins or spears tipped with bone, and (for close combat) the sword and lasso.
                    In warfare they seldom fight in rank, the method of attack they prefer being to
                    throw the enemy into confusion by repeated onset made in loose array. They are
                    wholly without religion or sense of moral obligation. For later information we
                    are dependent on the writers of the Byzantine history (see Stritter, <hi
