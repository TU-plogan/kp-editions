                    from the close of the 15th to the middle of the 16th century. Though closely
                    connected with Venice by her commercial relations, and geographically nearer to
                    Italy than to Flanders, Augsburg at the time of Maximilian cultivated art after
                    the fashion of the Flemings, and felt the influence of the schools of Bruges and
                    Brussels, which had branches at Cologne and in many cities about the headwaters
                    of the Rhine. It was not till after the opening of the 16th century, and between
                    that and the era of the Reformation, that Italian example mitigated to some
                    extent the asperity of South German painting. But this is not the place to give
                    even an outline of this development. It must be sufficient to note that Flemish
                    and German art was first tempered with Italian elements at Augsburg by Hans
                    Holbein the elder. Hans first appears at Augsburg as partner to his brother
                    Sigmund, who survived him and died in 1540 at Berne. Sigmund is described as a
                    painter, but his works have not come down to us. Hans had the lead of the
                    partnership at Augsburg, and signed all thρ pictures which it produced. In
                    common with Herlen, Schongauer, and other masters of South Germany, he first
                    cultivated a style akin to that of Memling and other followers of the schools of
                    Brussels and Bruges, but ho probably modified the systems of those schools by
                    studying the works of the masters of Cologne. As these early impressions waned,
                    they were replaced by others less favourable to the expansion of the master’s
                    fame; and as his custom increased between 1499 and 1506, we find him relying
                    less upon the teaching of the schools than upon a mere observation and
                    reproduction of the quaintnesses of local passion plays. Most of his early works
                    indeed are taken from the Passion, and in these he obviously marshalled his
                    figures with the shallow stage effect of the plays, copy · ing their artificial
                    system of grouping, careless to some extent of proportion in the human shape,
                    heedless of any but the coarser forms of expression, and technically satisfied
                    with the simplest methods of execution. If in any branch of his art he can be
                    said to have had a conscience at this period, we should say that he showed it in
                    his portrait drawings. It is seldom that we find a painted likeness worthy υf
                    the name. The drawings of which numbers are still preserved in the galleries of
                    Basel, Berlin, and Copenhagen show extraordinary quickness and delicacy of hand,
                    and a wonderful facility for seizing character; and this happily is. one of the
                    features which Holbein bequeathed to his son. It is between 1512 and 1522 that
                    Holbein tempered the German quality of his style with some North Italian
                    elements. A purer taste and more pleasing realism mark his work, which in
                    drapery, dress, and tone is as much more agreeable to the eye as in respect of
                    modelling and finish it is smoother and more carefully rounded. Costume,
                    architecture, ornament, and colour are applied with some knowledge of the higher
                    canons of art. Here too advantage accrued to Hans the younger, whose independent
                    career about this time began.</p>
                <p>The date of the elder Holbein’s birth is unknown. But his name appears in the
                    books of the tax-gatherers of Augsburg in 1494, superseding that of Michael
                    Holbein, who is supposed to have been his father. Previous to that date, and as
                    early as 1493, he was a painter of name, and he executed in that year, it is
                    said, for the abbey at Weingarten, the wings of an altarpiece representing
                    Joachim’s Offering, the Nativity of the Virgin, Mary’s Presentation in the
                    Temple, and the Presentation of Christ, which now hang in separate panels in the
                    cathedral of Augsburg. In these pieces and others of the same period, for
                    instance in two Madonnas in the Moritz chapel and castle of Nuremberg, we mark
                    the clear impress of the schools of Van der Weyden <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n63/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0063-0054"/> and Memling; whilst in later works, such as the
                    Basilica of St Paul (1504) in the gallery of Augsburg, the wane of Flemish
                    influence is apparent. But this altarpiece, with its quaint illustrations of St
                    Paul’s life and martyrdom is not alone of interest because its execution is
                    characteristic of old Holbein. It is equally so because it contains portraits of
                    the master himself, accompanied by his two sons, the painters Ambrose and Hans
                    Holbein. Later pictures, such as the Passion series in the Fürstenberg gallery
                    at Donaueschingen, or the Martyrdom of St Sebastian in the Munich Pinakothek,
                    contain similar portraits, the original drawings of which are found in old
                    Holbein’s sketch-book at Berlin, or in stray leaves like those possessed by the
                    duke of Aumale in Paris. Not one of these fails to give us an insight into the
                    character, or a reflex of the features, of the members of this celebrated
                    family. Old Holbein seems to ape Leonardo, allowing his hair and beard wildly to
                    grow, except on the upper lip. Hans the younger is a plain-looking boy. But his
                    father points to him with his finger, and hints that though but a child he is
                    clearly a prodigy.</p>
                <p>After 1516 Hans Holbein the elder appears as a defaulter in the registers of the
                    tax-gatherers at Augsburg; but he willingly accepts commissions abroad. At
                    Issenheim in Alsace, where Grünewald was employed in 1516, old Holbein also
                    finds patrons, and contracts to complete an altarpiece. But misfortune or a
                    bailiff pursues him, and he leaves Issenheim, abandoning his work and tools.
                    According to Sandrart, he wanders to Basel and takes the freedom of its guild.
                    His brother Sigmund and others are found suing him for debt before the courts of
                    Augsburg. Where he lived when he executed the altarpiece, of which two wings
                    with the date of 1522 are in the gallery of Carlsruhe, is uncertain; where he
                    died two years later is unknown. He slinks from ken at the close of a long life,
                    and disappears at last heeded by none but his own son, who claims his brushes
                    and paints from the monks of Issenheim without much chance of obtaining them.
                    His name is struck off the books of the Augsburg guild in 1524.</p>
                <p>The elder Holbein was a prolific artist, who left many pictures behind him.
                    Earlier than the Basilica of St Paul, already mentioned, is the Basilica of St
                    Mary Maggiore, and a Passion in eleven pièces, in the Augsburg gallery, both
                    executed in 1499. Another Passion, with the root of Jesse and a tree of the
                    Dominicans, is that preserved in the Staedel, Saalhof, and church of St Leonard
                    at Frankfort. It was executed in 1501. The Passion of Donaueschingen was
                    finished after 1502, in which year was completed the Passion of Kaisheim, a
                    conglomerate of twenty-seven panels, now divided amongst the galleries of
                    Munich, Nuremberg, Augsburg, and Schleissheim. An altarpiece of the same class,
                    commissioned for the monastery of St Moritz at Augsburg in 1504-8, has been
                    dispersed and lost. 1512 is the date of a Conception in the Augsburg gallery,
                    long assigned, in consequence of a forged inscription, to Hans Holbein the
                    younger. A diptych, with a Virgin and Child, and a portrait of an old man, dated
                    1513, is in separate parts in the collections of Mr Posonyi and Count
                    Lanckoronski at Vienna. The sketch-books of Berlin, Copenhagen, and Augsburg
                    give a lively picture of the forms and dress of Augsburg residents at the
                    beginning of the 16th century. They comprise portraits of the emperor
                    Maximilian, the future Charles V., Kunz von der Rosen the fool of Maximilian,
                    the Fuggers, friars, merchants, and at rare intervals ladies.</p>
