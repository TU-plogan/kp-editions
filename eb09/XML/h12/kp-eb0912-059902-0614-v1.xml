                    origin, borne by several Jews of the Maccabaean period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Hyrcanus</hi> I., high priest
                    of the Jews from 135 to 105 B.C., was the youngest son of Simon Maccabaeus. In
                    137 B.c. he, along with his brother Judas, commanded the force which repelled
                    the invasion of Judaea led by Cendebeus the general of Antiochus VII. (Sidetes).
                    On the assassination of his father and two elder brothers by Ptolemy, governor
                    of Jericho, his brother-in-law, in February 135, he succeeded to the high
                    priesthood and the supreme authority in Judaea. While still engaged in the
                    struggle with Ptolemy, he was attacked by Antiochus with a large army (134), and
                    compelled to shut himself up in Jerusalem; after a severe siege peace was at
                    last secured only on condition of a Jewish disarmament, and the payment of an
                    indemnity and an annual tribute, for which hostages were taken. In 129 he
                    accompanied Antiochus as a vassal prince on his ill-fated Parthian expedition;
                    returning, however, to Judaea before winter, he escaped the final disaster. By
                    the judicious mission of an embassy to Rome he now obtained confirmation of the
                    alliance which his father had previously made with the growing western power; at
                    the same time he availed himself of the weakened state of the Syrian monarchy
                    under Demetrius II. to overrun Samaria, and also to invade Idumaea, which he
                    completely subdued, compelling its inhabitants to receive circumcision and
                    accept the Jewish faith. After a long period of rest he directed his arms
                    against the town of Samaria, which, in spite of the intervention of Antiochus,,
                    his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus ultimately took, and by his orders razed to
                    the ground (c. 109 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> He died in 105, and was
                    succeeded by Aristobulus, the eldest of his five sons. The external policy of
                    Hyrcanus was marked by considerable energy and tact, and, aided as it was by
                    favouring circumstances, was so successful as to leave the Jewish nation in a
                    position of independence and of influence such as it had not known since the
                    days of Solomon. During its later years his reign was much disturbed, however,
                    by the contentions for ascendency which arose between the Pharisees and
                    Sadducees, the two rival sects or parties which then for the first time (under
                    those names at least) came into prominence. Josephus has related the curious
                    circumstances under which he ultimately transferred his personal support from
                    the former to the latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Hyrcanus</hi> II., high priest
                    from 78 to 40 B.C., was the eldest son of Alexander Jannaeus by his wife
                    Alexandra, and was thus a grandson of the preceding. When his father died in 78,
                    he was by his mother forthwith appointed high priest, and on her death in 69 he
                    claimed the succession to the supreme civil authority also; but, after a brief
                    and troubled reign of three months, he was compelled to abdicate both kingly and
                    priestly dignities in favour of his more energetic and ambitious younger brother
                    Aristobulus II. In 63 it suited the policy of Pompey that he should be restored
                    to the high priesthood, with some semblance of supreme command, but of much of
                    this semblance even he was soon again deprived by the arrangement of the
                    proconsul Gabinius, according to which Palestine was in 57 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    services rendered to Caesar after the battle of Pharsalia, he was again rewarded
                    with the sovereignty (προστασία τoυ ∈0voυs, Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,

                    appointment of Herod and Phasael to be tetrarchs of Judaea; and in the following
                    year he was taken prisoner by the Parthians, deprived of his ears that he might
                    be permanently disqualified for priestly office, and carried to Babylon. He was
                    permitted in 33 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to return to Jerusalem, where on
                    a charge of treasonable correspondence with Malchus, king of Arabia, he was put
                    to death in 30 B.c.</p>
