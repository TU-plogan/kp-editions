                <p><label type="entry">HUGH <hi rend="smallcaps">of St Victor</hi></label>, Hugo a
                    S. Victore, sometimes also known as Hugh of Paris (c. 1097-1141), was born,
                    probably in the neighbourhood of Ypres, about 1097, and is known to have
                    received his early education in the cloister of Hamersleben near Halberstadt; in
                    1115 he removed for the further advancement of his studies to the abbey of St
                    Victor, which had recently been founded by William of Champeaux, the preceptor
                    of Abelard, in the neighbourhood of Paris. There the remainder of his life was
                    spent in teaching or in studious retirement. He died in 1141.</p>
                <p>The works of Hugh of St Victor, who was the intimate friend of St Bernard, share
                    all the learning, acuteness, and mysticism of the theological school which then
                    sought to neutralize the opinions and the influence of Abelard. Of chief
                    importance are— <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    magister or didascalus. It forms a sort of encyclopaedia of the sciences as then
                    understood, viewed of course merely in their subordination to theology. In his
                    treatment of Biblical introduction, the sharpness with which he separates the
                    apocryphal from the canonical books has been noticed; but in doing so it is
                    important also to recollect that he seems to place on a par with the New
                    Testament the canons, the decretals, and the writings of the fathers. An
                    Augustinian in spirit and in language, so as to deserve the titles Alter
                    Augustinus and Lingua Augustini, by which he is frequently designated, Hugo was
                    still more eminently the disciple of Anselm and Abelard; he, however, had a
                    strongly marked individuality of his own, which appears in his somewhat fully
                    elaborated theory of knowing and being. All the knowable he assigns to one or
                    other of three spheres, that of intelligence, that of science, and that of
                    logic. That of intelligence embraces both theory and practice. Under theory fall
                    to be classed theology, mathematics (arithmetic, music, geometry, astronomy),
                    and physics; practice is equivalent to ethics. Science has to do with the
                    practical arts and industries, while logic embraces grammar, rhetoric, and
                    dialectic. In correspondence to the trichotomous division of man, as made up of
                    body, soul, and spirit, he speaks of a threefold eye, that of the body, that of
                    reason, and that of contemplation. The last of these, by which God is discerned,
                    has been totally destroyed by sin; the second has been much impaired. Faith now
                    takes the place of contemplation; but by oratio and operatio it can attain to
                    real convictions and genuine love. The doctrine of the Trinity he illustrates by
                    the analogy of the human personality as spirit, wisdom, and love. The collected
                    works have been printed at Paris in 1528, at Venice in 1588, at Mainz and
                    Cologne in 1617, and at Rouen in 1648. They occupy three volumes (175-177) in
