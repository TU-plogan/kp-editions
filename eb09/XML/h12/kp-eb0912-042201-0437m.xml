                    outrage, with special reference to lust; hence an outrage on nature, a
                    mongrel.</p>
                <p>As a general rule animals or plants belonging to distinct species are not able,
                    when crossed with each other, to produce offspring. There are, however,
                    innumerable exceptions to this rule; and hybridism is the word employed to
                    denote these exceptions. It is an abstract term which signifies the more or less
                    fertile crossing of distinct species. In scientific usage, the term “hybrid” is
                    exclusively reserved to denote the result of a fertile cross between two
                    distinct species, while the term “mongrel” is the one which is as exclusively
                    reserved to denote the result of a fertile cross between two varieties of the
                    same species.</p>
                <p>Until recently the interest attaching to hybridism was almost entirely of a
                    practical nature, and arose from the fact, which is of considerable importance
                    in horticulture, that hybrids are often found to present characters somewhat
                    different from those of either parent species. But of late years the subject has
                    acquired a high degree of scientific interest in relation to the theory of
                    descent. On this account it has been so carefully and thoroughly treated by Mr
                    Darwin that a brief exposition of its main facts and principles must necessarily
                    be little more than a condensation of his already closely packed material.</p>
                <p>Looking first to the general facts and principles of hybridism, apart from their
                    bearing upon the theory of descent, the following may be regarded as the most
                    important :—</p>
                <p>1. The laws governing the production of hybrids are identical, or nearly
                    identical, in the animal and vegetable kingdoms.</p>
                <p>2. The sterility which so generally attends the crossing of two specific forms is
                    to be distinguished as of two kinds, which, although often confounded by
                    naturalists, are in reality quite distinct. For the sterility may obtain between
                    the two parent species when first crossed, or it may first assert itself in
                    their hybrid progeny. In the latter case the hybrids, although possibly produced
                    without any appearance of infertility on the part of their parent species,
                    nevertheless prove more or less infertile among themselves, and also with
                    members of either parent species.</p>
                <p>3. The degree of both kinds of infertility varies in the case of different
                    species, and in that of their hybrid progeny, from absolute sterility up to
                    complete fertility. Thus, to take the case of plants, “when pollen from a plant
                    of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts
                    no more influence than so much inorganic dust. From this absolute zero of
                    fertility, the pollen of different species, applied to the stigma of some one
                    species of the same genus, yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds
                    produced, up to nearly complete, or even quite complete, fertility; so, in
                    hybrids themselves, there are some which never have produced, and probably never
                    would produce, even with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed;
                    but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the
                    pollen of one of the pure parent species causing the flower of the hybrid to
                    wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the early withering of the
                    flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilization. From this extreme
                    degree of sterility we have self-fertilized hybrids producing a greater and
                    greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility.”</p>
                <p>4. Although there is, as a rule, a certain parallelism, there is no fixed
                    relation between the degree of sterility manifested by the parent species when
                    crossed and that which is manifested by their hybrid progeny. There are many
                    cases in which two pure species can be crossed with unusual facility, while the
                    resulting hybrids are remarkably sterile; and, contrariwise, there are species
                    which can only be crossed with extreme difficulty, though the hybrids, when
                    produced, are very fertile. Even within the limits of the same genus, these two
                    opposite cases may occur.</p>
                <p>5. When two species are reciprocally crossed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> male A
                    with female B, and male B with female A, the degree of sterility often differs
                    greatly in the two cases. The sterility of the resulting hybrids may differ
                    likewise.</p>
                <p>6. The degree of sterility of first crosses and of hybrids runs, to a certain
                    extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are united.
                    “For species belonging to distinct genera can rarely, and those belonging to
                    distinct families can never, be crossed. The parallelism, however, is far from
                    complete; for a multitude of closely allied species will not unite, or unite
                    with extreme difficulty, whilst other species, widely different from each other,
                    can be crossed with perfect facility. Nor does the difficulty depend on ordinary
                    constitutional differences; for annual and perennial plants, deciduous and
                    evergreen trees, plants flowering at different seasons, inhabiting different
                    stations, and naturally living under the most opposite climates, can often be
                    crossed with ease. The difficulty or facility apparently depends exclusively on
                    the sexual constitution of the species which are crossed, or on their sexual
                    elective affinity.”</p>
                <p>Such being the principal facts of hybridism, we may next consider the relation
                    which they bear to the theory of descent. It is obvious that the most important
                    point of contact between the former and the latter consists in this —that,
                    although hybridism is occasionally possible as an exception to the general
                    infertility of species <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> it is only, as it were,
                    a partial exception; for, even when produced, the hybrid progeny almost
                    invariably manifest some greater or less degree of sterility, and this not only
                    when crossed among themselves, but even when crossed with either of their parent
                    species. The main facts of hybridism thus at first sight seem to support the
                    time-honoured doctrine that there are placed between all species the barriers of
                    mutual sterility, for the purpose of preventing any admixture of specific
                    qualities by heredity, and so for the purpose of maintaining the immutability of
                    specific types. And the apparent support which this doctrine thus receives from
                    the main facts of hybridism is still further strengthened when these facts are
                    contrasted with those which are supplied by the breeding of our domestic
                    “varieties.” For, in the latter case, and as an almost invariable rule, neither
                    the organisms when crossed nor their resulting progeny show any indications of
                    sterility, although the two parent varieties may differ from one another even
                    more widely than do many natural species which are wholly infertile when
                    crossed. This very general distinction between natural species and domestic
                    varieties has appeared to many competent persons in the present generation so
                    profound and significant that they deem it to be in itself sufficient to
                    discredit, if not to negative, the whole theory of the transmutation of
                    species.</p>
                <p>Now, when this distinction is thus posited as an objection to the theory of
                    descent, we must first of all remember that this theory does not require the
                    possibility of the commingling of specific types; it requires, indeed, that
                    specific types should not be immutably fixed, but it does not require that the
                    causes of their mutation should depend upon their mutual crossing. The whole
                    difficulty, therefore, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n438/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0438-0423"/> the theory of descent has here to meet is to
                    explιin why it is that natural species are fenced about, as it were, with the
                    mysterious barriers of sterility, while no such seeming care appears to have
                    been taken in the case of our domestic breeds—even though in the latter case
                    artificial selection by the breeders may have produced more visible difference
                    between the two parent races than that which natural selection is supposed to
                    have produced between two natural species.</p>
                <p>In answer to this difficulty, the most important consideration to begin with is
                    one that is very generally lost sight of. The consideration is that mutual
                    sterility between organic forms has been constituted by naturalists the chief
                    criterion of specific distinction, and therefore it is merely to argue in a
                    circle to maintain that specific distinction is of some transcendental nature
                    <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it is so invariably associated with this mutual
                    sterility. If it were not for the fact of their mutual sterility, this and that
                    species would probably not have been classified as such; and therefore it is now
                    scarcely to be considered a matter of any great significance that all species
                    present more or less of the peculiarity in virtue of which they are recognized
                    as species. Or, otherwise stated, on the supposition that species have had a
                    derivative origin, whenever the modification of a specific type has proceeded
                    sufficiently far to induce sterility with allied types, the modified type is,
                    <hi rend="italic">for this reason,</hi> classified as a distinct species;
                    otherwise, upon the supposition, the species could, scarcely have become
                    separated out as a distinct type. The argument which points to such sterility as
                    evidence against this supposition is, therefore, so far inconclusive.</p>
                <p>The case, however, ought not in fairness to be stated quite so strongly as this;
                    for mutual sterility, although the chief, is not the only criterion of specific
                    distinction. In forming their classifications, naturalists endeavour as much as
                    possible to have regard to organisms in the totality of their structures and
                    functions. It may therefore still be maintained that, although the above
                    consideration as to mutual sterility being selected as the chief criterion of
                    specific distinction greatly mitigates the force of the argument that natural
                    species differ from artificial breeds in being more or less sterile with one
                    another, still this consideration does not altogether destroy that argument.
                    For, on the one hand, it is not mutual sterility alone which is taken as a test
                    of specific distinction; and, on the other hand, it generally so happens that
                    the other qualities distinctive of any given species do not differ more widely
                    from those which are distinctive of allied species than is the case with many of
                    our domestic breeds. It therefore still remains a significant circumstance that,
                    <hi rend="italic">along with</hi> the differences distinctive of natural
                    species, there almost invariably goes the protective attribute of mutual
                    sterility; while the possibly greater differences distinctive of our domestic
                    breeds are unaccompanied by any such protective attribute. But, again, this more
                    refined objection can be met and satisfactorily excluded by the general
                    consideration that “as species rarely or never become modified in one character,
                    without being at the same time modified in many, and as systematic affinity
                    includes all visible resemblances and dissimilarities, any difference in sexual
                    constitution between two species would naturally stand in more or less close
                    relation with their systematic positionr.”</p>
                <p>But we are not confined to this general consideration alone. There are several
                    other general considerations which tend still further to mitigate the
                    difficulty, and there are several particular facts which together prove that the
                    alleged distinction between natural species and domestic varieties is one, not
                    of kind, but of degree. We shall, therefore, next proceed to state these general
                    considerations and particular facts.</p>
                <p>Upon the theory of descent, mutual sterility between specific types is nothing
                    more than the expression of some certain amount of modification having taken
                    place in the reproductive system of a changing form, which up to that time, and
                    but for the fact of this modification, would have been classified by naturalists
                    as a mere variety. Now the causes which act upon the reproductive system, both
                    of animals and plants, and whether in the direction of sterility or
                    prolificness, are at present hopelessly obscure. We cannot, therefore, expect to
                    distinguish the causes which in the case of any given species have determined
                    sterility. Nor is it necessary, for the meeting of the present difficulty, that
                    this should be done; it is enough for this purpose to show that the causes which
                    thus act upon the reproductive system are much too indistinct to admit of any
                    argument being raised upon them. And this it is most easy to show; for it is not
                    too much to say that the reproductive system is, generally speaking, of all
                    parts of an organism the most delicately susceptible to slight changes in the
                    conditions of life. Mr Darwin has adduced a vast array of facts on this head in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication.</hi>
                    As a result of this delicacy, there arises an apparent capriciousness in the
                    ways and degrees in which the reproductive system is affected by slight changes
                    in the conditions of life, by too close interbreeding, by grafting, and by many
                    other causes. Thus, for example, the influences of domestication produce more or
                    less sterility in numberless species of wild animals and plants, while in other
                    species— and this, as we shall presently see, is a matter of great importance in
                    the present connexion—such influences are favourable to fertility. Now if we
                    suppose, as in consistency we must suppose, that throughout the course of
                    evolution the reproductive system has always been characterized by a
                    sensitiveness to slight changes similar to that which we now observe, and if we
                    remember that, in any case where these slight changes were sufficient to cause
                    mutual sterility between the modified descendants of a common progenitor, a
                    distinction of species must necessarily have arisen,—we shall cease to regard
                    the present steri <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ity of species <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se</hi> as anything more than what might be expected <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori,</hi> supposing the theory of descent with gradual
                    modification to be true.</p>
                <p>As evidence of the apparent capriciousness with which sterility may be
                    manifested, owing to the slight and imperceptible causes on which it depends,
                    special allusion must here be made to a highly remarkable and significant fact
                    that has been brought to light by the direct experiments of Mr Darwin. The
                    following is his account of these experiments :—</p>
                <p>“Several plants belonging to distinct orders present two forms, which exist in
                    about equal numbers, and which differ in no respect except in their reproductive
                    organs,—one form having a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short
                    pistil with long stamens; both with differently-sized pollen grains. With
                    trimorphic plants there are three forms likewise differing in the length of
                    their pistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the pollen grains, and in
                    some other respects; and, as in each of the three forms there are two sets of
                    stamens, there are altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils.
                    These organs are so proportioned in length to each other that, in any two of the
                    forms, half the stamens in each stand on a level with the stigma of the third
                    form. Now I have shown, and the result has been confirmed by other observers,
                    that in order to obtain full fertility with other plants, it is necessary that
                    the stigma of the one form should be fertilized by pollen taken from the stamens
                    of corresponding height in the other form. So that with dimorphic species two
                    unions, which may be called legitimate, are fully fertile, and two which may be
                    called illegitimate are more or less infertile. With trimorphic species six
                    unions are legitimate or fully fertile, and twelve are illegitimate or more or
                    less infertile. The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and
                    trimorphic plants when they are illegitimately fertilized, that is, by pollen
                    taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil, differs much in
                    degree up to absolute and utter sterility,— just in the same manner as occurs in
                    crossing distinct species.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0439-0424"/> In this case we appear to have actual evidence of
                    different stages of increasing sterility <hi rend="italic">in transitu,</hi> and
                    this even within the limits of the same natural species. And if even such
                    evidence as this can be resisted, there still remains one very important fact,
                    which directly affects the whole alleged distinction between the sterility of
                    natural species and the fertility of domestic breeds. This fact is that plants
                    belonging to several species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Passiflora</hi> have
                    been amply proved, not only to be completely fertile with plants belonging to
                    other species, but even to be as completely infertile with plants belonging to
                    their own. Thus fruit could not be obtained from <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">alata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >racemosa</hi> except by reciprocally fertilizing them with each other’s pollen;
                    and similar facts have been observed by several experimentalists with regard to
                    four or five other species of this genus. The fullest details on the subject are
                    those given by Mr Scott in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Liηnean
                    Society,</hi> vol. viii. p. 168. Plants belonging to three species of the genus,
                    viz., <hi rend="italic">P. racemosa, coerulea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >alata,</hi> flowered for many years in Edinburgh, but, though repeatedly
                    fertilized by Mr Scott and others with their own pollen, never produced seed.
                    But when mutually crossed in various ways they all produced seed. After quoting
                    this case Mr Darwin adds :—</p>
                <p>“Returning to <hi rend="italic">Ρ. αlαtα,</hi> I have received (1866) some
                    interesting details from Mr Robinson Munro. Three plants, including one in
                    England, have already been mentioned which were inveterately self-sterile, and
                    Mr Munro informs me of several others which, after repeated trials during many
                    years, have been found in the same predicament. At some other places, however,
                    this species fruits readily when fertilized with its own pollen. At Taymouth
                    Castle there is a plant which was formerly grafted by Mr Donaldson on a distinct
                    species, name unknown, and ever since the operation it has produced fruit in
                    abundance by its own pollen, so that this small and unnatural .change in the
                    state of this plant has restored its selffertility. Some of the seedlings from
                    the Taymouth Castle plant were found to be not only sterile with their own
                    pollen, but with each other’s pollen and with the pollen of distinct species.
                    Pollen from the Taymouth plant failed to fertilize certain plants of the same
                    species, but was successful on one plant in the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens.
                    Seedlings were raised from this latter union, and some of their flowers were
                    fertilized by Mr Munro with their own pollen; but they were found to be as
                    self-impotent as the mother plant had always proved, except when fertilized by
                    the grafted Taymouth plant, and except, as we shall see, when fertilized by her
                    own seedlings. Yet Mr Munro fertilized eighteen flowers on the self-impotent
                    mother plant with pollen from these her own self-impotent seedlings, and
                    obtained, remarkable as the fact is, eighteen fine capsules full of excellent
                    seed. I have met with no case in regard to plants which shows so well as this of
                    <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">alata</hi> on what small and
                    mysterious causes complete fertility or complete sterility depends.”</p>
                <p>These cases in the genus <hi rend="italic">Passiflora,</hi> although so highly
                    remarkable, are not wholly unique. There is not, indeed, any other case of a
                    natural species, the members of which are only fertile with members of another
                    species; but there are several cases of natural species, the members of which
                    are self-impotent, though freely fertile either with other plants of the same
                    species, or with plants of different though allied species. This may perhaps be
                    regarded as a transitional stage between the ordinary condition of plants and
                    the extraordinary condition that obtains among species of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Passiflora.</hi> It occurs in individual plants of certain species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Lobelia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Verbascum,</hi> and
                    among several genera of orchids. The cases of the latter are particularly
                    remarkable, inasmuch as Fritz Müller found from numerous experiments, not only
                    that individual plants belonging to the several species were not fertilized by
                    their own pollen, while freely so by pollen taken from distinct species, and
                    even from distinct genera, but that the plant’s own pollen was positively
                    deleterious to its stigma, and acted as a poison to the destruction of the
                    flower.</p>
                <p>So much,, then, for the facts which go to prove on what slight constitutional
                    differences sterility may depend, and the consequent probability there is that
                    it should generally be found to accompany a change of organization which is
                    sufficiently great to be regarded by naturalists as a specific distinction. But
                    the pleading must not end here. For there still remains to be adduced the fact,
                    already mentioned as one of the general facts of hybridism, that “the degree of
                    both kinds of fertility varies in the case of different species, and in that of
                    their hybrid progeny, from absolute sterility up to complete fertility.” As a
                    matter of fact, the distinction between natural species and domestic varieties,
                    upon which the whole discussion has hitherto proceeded, is in itself untenable;
                    the infertility of natural species when crossed, although without question the
                    general rule, is nevertheless not the invariable rule. We need not point to the
                    highly anomalous case of <hi rend="italic">Passiflora</hi> recently mentioned in
                    another connexion, and probably to be explained as the result of cultivation;
                    for we appear to have sufficient evidence without it. It is true that a great
                    deal of negative evidence has been published upon this point by very competent
                    experimentalists; but it seems impossible to resist the positive evidence of the
                    Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, whose distinguished success in hybridizing Mr Darwin
                    attributes to “great horticultural skill, and to his having hot-houses at his
                    command.” Of his many results, which from being of a positive kind can scarcely
                    be suspected of inaccuracy, it will be enough to quote the following :—“Every
                    ovule in a pod of <hi rend="italic">Crinum capeηse</hi> fertilized by <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">revolutum</hi> produced a plant, which I
                    never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation.” Thus, as Mr Darwin in
                    alluding to this case remarks, “we have perfect, or even more than commonly
                    perfect, fertility in a first cross between two distinct species.”</p>
                <p>So far, then, as one side of the question before us is concerned, or that
                    relating to the mutual infertility of natural species, enough has been said to
                    show that it presents no real difficulty to the theory of descent. Indeed, in
                    view of all that has now been said, the difficulty, as Mr Darwin has observed,
                    is not so much to account for the sterility of natural species, as it is to
                    account for the continued, or even increased, fertility of our domestic
                    varieties. Turning, therefore, to this other side of the question, we have to
                    remember that the very same sensitiveness of the reproductive system, which in
                    some cases leads to infertility under a change in the conditions of life, in
                    other cases leads to increased fertility under an apparently similar change in
                    the conditions of life. Thus it is that domestication produces such apparently
                    capricious results with regard to fertility—inducing all degrees of infertility
                    in some wild species, while not at all impairing, or even increasing, fertility
                    in others. Consequently, when the question is as to why our domestic varieties
                    do not become sterile <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> when so many natural
                    species have become so, the answer is that the mere fact of their domestication
                    proves that their wild or parent stocks must have been some of those species
                    whose reproductive systems were not highly sensitive to changes in their
                    condition of life, and therefore species which “might be expected to produce
                    varieties little liable to have their reproductive systems injuriously affected
                    by the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like
                    manner.” Thus, on the inherently necessary view that our domestic varieties have
                    all proceeded from species which were not easily affected in the direction of
                    sterility, we are not surprised that under variation their reproductive systems
                    should continue to manifest a high degree of tolerance. To this must be added
                    that domestication, if it does not produce sterility, seems well calculated to
                    increase fertility. For if the causes inducing sterility (whatever they may be)
                    are absent, ample and regular nutrition, combined with innumerable lesser
                    benefits attending domestication, may well be supposed to favour fertility. And,
                    as a matter of fact, according to Pallas, there is a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n440/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0440-0425"/> great deal of evidence to indicate that prolonged
                    domestication has a tendency to eliminate sterility; so that wild species which
                    when first domesticated intercross with difficulty, become in time able to
                    intercross with facility. Such, for instance, appears to have been the case with
                    the dog; for on the one hand all the domestic varieties of this animal are now
                    freely fertile among themselves, and, on the other hand, there is independent
                    evidence that these varieties have sprung from more than one natural species.
                    Again, mention must not be omitted of the important fact that, although in the
                    case of none of our varieties of domesticated animals is there any evidence of
                    mutual sterility, yet among our varieties of domesticated plants a few cases
                    have been observed of complete mutual sterility, which is in every way analogous
                    to that which occurs between natural species. Thus, Gärtner observed this to be
                    the case with certain varieties of maize and <hi rend="italic">Verbascum,</hi>
                    Kölreuter with one kind of tobacco, and other experimentalists with sundry
                    varieties of gourd and melon. And here, let it be observed, we have the exact
                    counterpart that evolutionists would desire to the experiments of Herbert above
                    mentioned; for while he was able to break down the general distinction between
                    natural species and domestic varieties on the side of proving perfect fertility
                    between certain natural species, these experimentalists have broken down the
                    distinction on the side of proving perfect sterility between certain of our
                    domestic varieties. Therefore, we may conclude that this side of the question,
                    or that as to the fertility of our domestic varieties, presents as harmless an
                    aspect towards the theory of descent as we have already seen to be presented by
                    the other side of the question, or that as to the sterility, of natural
                    species.</p>
                <p>Finally, there are two complementary considerations to be adduced, which may now
                    be stated together. One is that the general principles of hybridism, as briefly
                    stated at the beginning of this article, are really far from indicative of
                    having been instituted with any design of simply preventing species from
                    intercrossing. For, upon the view that they were so instituted, scarcely any one
                    of them admits of a rational explanation. Thus, upon this view, no reason can be
                    assigned why the degree of sterility should be so extremely variable in
                    different species, when it must be supposed equally important that all species
                    should be kept distinct; nor canit be said why the degree of sterility should
                    vary even among individuals of the same species. Neither can it be said why some
                    species should cross with facility, and yet produce sterile hybrids, while other
                    species cross with difficulty, and yet produce fertile hybrids. Why should
                    species living in countries remote from one another, and therefore not able in a
                    state of nature to come together, nevertheless prove as sterile <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se</hi> as species inhabiting the same country? Why, again,
                    should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross
                    betw⅛en two species? Or why, indeed, should the production of hybrids have been
                    permitted at all? As Mr Darwin observes, “to grant to species the special power
                    of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further propagation by different
                    degrees of sterility, not strictly related to the facility of the first union
                    between their parents, seems a strange arrangement.”</p>
                <p>The other and complementary consideration which has to be mentioned is that, on
                    the counter supposition of all these general principles of hybridism being
                    “simply incidental,” or dependent on unknown differences in the reproductive
                    systems of species,—on this supposition we meet with sundry differences between
                    wild species and domestic varieties which are fully analogous to their
                    difference of fertility, and which yet cannot reasonably be supposed to serve
                    any transcendental purpose. Thus, again to quote Mr Darwin :—</p>
                <p>“Some allied species of trees cannot be grafted on each other— all varieties can
                    be so grafted. Some allied animals are affected in a very different manner by
                    the same poison, but with varieties no such case until recently was known, out
                    now it has been proved that immunity from certain poisons stands in some cases
                    in correlation with the colour of the hair. The period of gestation generally
                    differs much with distinct species, but with varieties until lately no such
                    difference had been observed. The time required for the germination of seeds
                    differs in an analogous manner, and I am not aware that any difference in this
                    respect has as yet been detected with varieties. Here we have various
                    physiological differences, and no doubt others could be added, between one
                    species and another of the same genus, which do not occur, or occur with extreme
                    rarity, in the case of varieties; and these differences are apparently wholly or
                    in chief part incidental on other constitutional differences, just in the same
                    manner as the sterility of crossed species is incidental on differences confined
                    to the sexual system. Why, then, should these latter differences, however
                    serviceable they may indirectly be in keeping the inhabitants of the same
                    country distinct, be thought of such paramount importance in comparison with
                    other incidental and functional differences? No sufficient answer to this
                    question can be given.”</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, therefore, it may be concluded that the difficulty which the
                    facts of hybridism seem at first sight to raise against the theory of descent
                    may be explained in harmony with the main requirements of that theory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animal Hybrids.—</hi> A few words may here be added with
                    special reference to animal hybrids. As a general statement it may be said that
                    hybrids, not only between specific but generic forms, are more easily produced
                    in the case of animals than in that of plants. The hybrids, however, when
                    produced are, as a general rule, more sterile. Indeed, it is doubtful whether
                    there is any single instance of a perfectly fertile hybrid having emanated from
                    a cross between two animal species. Mr Darwin, however, says— “I have reason to
                    believe that the hybrids from <hi rend="italic">Cervulus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vaginalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reeνesii,</hi> and from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phasianus</hi><hi rend="italic">colchicus</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">torquatus,</hi> are perfectly fertile.” Also M.
                    Quatrefages states that the hybrid progeny of two moths <hi rend="italic"
                    >^B91ηbyx cynthia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B. αrriηdia)</hi> showed themselves
                    to be fertile <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> for eight generations. The hare
                    and rabbit are said occasionally to breed together, and their offspring to be
                    highly fertile when crossed with either parent species. Lastly, Mr Darwin
                    observes :—</p>
                <p>“The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese <hi rend="italic">{A.
                    cygηοides),</hi> species which are so different that they have sometimes been
                    ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure
                    parent, and in several instances <hi rend="italic">inter se.</hi> This was
                    effected by Mr Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents, but from
                    different hatches and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids
                    (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however, these
                    cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by two eminently
                    capable judges, namely, Mr Blyth and Captain Hutton, that whole flocks of these
                    crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country; and, as they are kept
                    for profit where neither pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be
                    highly or perfectly fertile.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Since the above was published, Mr Darwin has himself
                    procured two of these hybrid geese, and from them (brother and sister) raised
                    five “extremely fine birds from two hatches.” These five hybrids “resembled in
                    every detail their hybrid parents” (see <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> Jam 1,
                    1880).</p></note></p>
                <p>It is somewhat remarkable that hitherto direct experiments on the hybridization
                    of animals have been so few in number as compared with those on the
                    hybridization of plants. This is the more to be regretted, because, as already
                    observed, animals appear to display a somewhat greater aptitude for hybridizing
                    than plants, and consequently furnish better material for ascertaining the
                    furth. jt limits of systematic affinity within which a cross may prove fertile.
                    But here direct experiments are wanting, and all we can say with certainty is
                    that in animals, as in plants, no authentic instance is on record of progeny
                    resulting from a union of two individuals separated from one another by more
                    than a generic distinction.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Graft-Hybridism.—</hi> The only other subject of importance
                    that falls under the present heading, is that which has been appropriately
                    called “graft-hybridism.” It is well known that, when two varieties or allied
                    species are grafted together, each retains its distinctive characters. But to
                    this general, if not universal, rule there are on record several alleged
                    exceptions, in which either the scion is said to have partaken of the qualities
                    of the stock, the stock of the scion, or each to have affected the other.
                    Supposing any of these influences to have been exerted, the resulting product
                    would deserve to be called a graft-hybrid. It is clearly a matter of great
                    interest to ascertain whether such formation of hybrids by grafting is really
                    possible; for, if even one instance of such formation could be unequivocally
                    proved, it would show that sexual and asexual reproduction are essentially
                    identical.</p>
                <p>The cases of alleged graft-hybridism are exceedingly few, considering the
                    enormous number of grafts that are made every year by horticulturists, and have
                    been so made for centuries. Of these cases the most celebrated are those of
                    Adam’s laburnum <hi rend="italic">{Cytisus</hi><hi rend="italic">Adami)</hi> and
                    the bizzarria orange. Adam’s laburnum is now flourishing in numerous places
                    throughout Europe, all the trees having been raised as cuttings from the
                    original graft, which was made by inserting a bud of the purple laburnum into a
                    stock of the yellow. Μ. Adam, who made the graft, has left on record that from
                    it there sprang the existing hybrid. There can be no question as to the truly
                    hybrid character of the latter—all the peculiarities of both parent species
                    being often blended in the same raceme, flower, or even petal; but until the
                    experiment shall have been successfully repeated, there must always remain a
                    strong suspicion that, notwithstanding the assertion and doubtless the belief of
                    Μ. Adam, the hybrid arose as a cross in the ordinary way of seminal
                    reproduction. Similarly, the bizzarria orange, which is unquestionably a hybrid
                    between the bitter orange and the citron,—since it presents the remarkable
                    spectacle of these two different fruits blended into one,—is stated by the
                    gardener who first succeeded in producing it to have arisen as a graft-hybrid;
                    but here again a similar doubt, similarly due to the need of corroboration,
                    attaches to the statement. And the same remark applies to the still more
                    wonderful case of the so-called trifacial orange, which blends three distinct
                    kinds of fruit in one, and which is said to have been produced by artificially
                    splitting and uniting the seeds taken from the three distinct species, the
                    fruits of which now occur blended in the triple hybrid.</p>
                <p>The other instances of alleged graft-hybridism are too numerous to be here
                    noticed in detail; they refer to jessamine, ash, hazel, vine, hyacinth, potato,
                    beet, and rose. Of these the cases of the vine, beet, and rose are the strongest
                    as evidence of graft-hybridization, from the fact that some of them were
                    produced as the result of careful experiments made by very competent
                    experimentalists. On the whole, the results of some of these experiments,
                    although so few in number, must be regarded as making out a strong case in
                    favour of the possibility of graft-hybridism. For it must always be remembered
                    that in experiments of this kind, negative evidence, however great in amount,
                    may be logically dissipated by a single positive result.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Literature.—</hi> From time immemorial the leading
                    facts of hybridism have been known in the case of the horse and the ass. The
                    knowledge of corresponding facts as occurring in the vegetable kingdom
                    necessarily dates from a time subsequent to that at which the sexual functions
                    of plants became known, i.e., towards the end of the 17th century. The earliest
                    recorded observation of a hybrid plant is one by Gmelin; the next is that of
                    Thomas Fairchild, who in the second decade of the 18th century produced the
                    cross which is still grown in gardens under the name of “Fairchild’s Sweet
                    William.” Later on in that century Linnaeus made a number of experiments on the
                    cross fertilization of plants, and produced various hybrids; but it was
                    .reserved for the laborious investigations of Kolreuter, towards the end of that
                    century (1751-1799), to found and largely to build the existing structure of our
                    scientific knowledge upon this subject. To him also belongs the credit of first
                    discovering the part played by insects in the fertilization of flowers. He
                    published most of his results at the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Next in
                    order of time deserve mention the works of Graf Lavola <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Discorso della Irri!abilita d'alcuni Fiori nuovamente scopcrta,</hi> 1764),
                    and of Conrad Sprengel <hi rend="italic">{Das entdeckte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geheimniss</hi><hi rend="italic">der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der
                    Blumen,</hi> 1793). The latter work is full of interesting observations on the
                    connexion between the structure of flowers and the visitation of insects. Next
                    we come to the celebrated horticulturist, Thomas Andrew Knight, who from 1787
                    for a number of years devoted an immense amount of labour, with a large measure
                    of results, to the improvement of fruit trees and vegetables by crossing. He
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Trans.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hort.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Soc.</hi> During the first quarter of the present century the only names that
                    in the present connexion call for mention are those of J. E. Smith <hi
                    rend="italic">(Flora Britannica,</hi> 1800), Villars <hi rend="italic">(Ro.
                    Coll. Bot.,</hi> 1809), Hoppe <hi rend="italic">(Neues</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bot.</hi><hi rend="italic">Taschenb.,</hi> 1810), Guillemin and Dumas (“Obs.
                    sur l’Hybridité d. Plant.,” in <hi rend="italic">Mém. Paris Soc.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nat.,</hi> 1833), Henschel, and
                    Godron. During this period, besides Knight, already mentioned, there were two
                    other English experimentalists at work, whose names deserve to be placed in the
                    first rank among those which are associated with this subject. These are Sweet,
                    who published an important work on <hi rend="italic">Geraniaceoe,</hi> and
                    Herbert, whose work on <hi rend="italic">Amaryllideoe,</hi> together with sundry
                    publications in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Horticul</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">ural Society,</hi> very
                    materially advanced both the facts and the theory of hybridism. We say “theory,”
                    because it was in these publications that Herbert carried on his celebrated
                    controversy with Knight regarding the alleged sterility of hybrids. In 1828
                    there was published a prize essay by Wiegmann on a thesis λvhich was set several
                    years before by the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and which embodied the question
                    whether hybrid plants are necessarily sterile. We next come, in the second
                    quarter of the present century, to the laborious researches of Gartner, the
                    number of whose experiments in hybridizing has certainly not been surpassed, and
                    probably has not been equalled, by that of any other experimentalist. His
                    principal work is <hi rend="italic">Versuche und Beobachtungen über die
                    Bastarderzeugung im Pflanzenreiche.</hi> In connexion with this period we may
                    also mention the names of Braun, Wallroth, Zuccarini, Meyer, Ziz, Koch, Schiede,
                    Lasch, Reichenbach, A. P. de Candolle, Wimmer, Hornschuh, and Nägeli. In 1854 a
                    research of value was published by Klotzsch (<hi rend="italic">Verhandl. Kgl.
                    Preuss. Akad. Berlin),</hi> and others later by Regel, Godron, and Jordon. . In
                    1860 a prize was offered by the French Academy of Sciences for the best essay on
                    hybridism, with special reference to three points,—the fertility or sterility of
                    hybrids, the cause of their sterility, and the constancy of type manifested by
                    fertile hybrids. In 1865 this prize was awarded jointly to Naudin and Godron,
                    the latter name being identified with researches upon the character of hybrids
                    which deserve to be considered among the most important of the present century.
                    The next work of note appeared in 1865, by Max Wichura, on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Bastardbefruchtung</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pflanzenreich,</hi> &amp;c. He combined, in one complex hybrid,
                    six different species of <hi rend="italic">Salix</hi>; confirmed, in opposition
                    to Godron, the doctrine of Kolreuter, Herbert, Gärtner, and Naudin, that a
                    hybrid is best fertilized by its own pollen; and found, in opposition to Naudin,
                    that the progeny of hybrid willows retains its hybrid character. In 1865-6
                    Nägeli published his important observations on naturally produced hybrids <hi
                    rend="italic">{Sitzungsbcr. Akad.</hi><hi rend="italic">München,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Math. Phys.).</hi> The highly important experiments of Darwin bn
                    dimorphic and trimorphic plants have been already alluded to. Those who within
                    still more recent years have contributed to the literature of hybridism are
                    Caspary, Mendel, Seden, Dominy, Kellermann, Fr. Schultz, Timbal-Lagrave,
                    Grenier, A. Kerner, Wirtgen, Miehalet, Ritschl, Beckhaus, P. Ascherson, R. von
                    Ueehtritz, J. Schmalhausen, C. Haussknecht, V. von Borbas, Kuntze, Henniger, and
                    W. O. Focke. The last-named author has just published an elaborate and valuable
                    work on hybridism in plants <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pflanzen-Mischlinge,</hi> Berlin, 1881), giving a tabular series of all the
                    known vegetable hybrids, and treating the entire subject in a very comprehensive
                    manner.</p>
                <p>On the subject of animal hybrids there is virtually no literature, save scattered
                    records of fertile crosses among sundry species confined in various menageries;
                    and these are without interest as bearing on any of the principles of hybridism.
