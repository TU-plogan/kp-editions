                <p><label type="entry">HOWARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1726-1790),
                    “the philanthropist,” was born in 1726, most probably on September 2, and at
                    Enfield, where his father, a moderately wealthy retired London merchant, had a
                    country house. His childhood was spent at Cardington near Woburn, Bedfordshire,
                    where his father had a small estate; for seven years he was under the tuition of
                    the Rev. John Worsley of Hertford (author of a Latin grammar and of a new
                    translation of the New Testament); and he was afterwards placed for a short time
                    at a private academy in London under Mr John Eames, F.R.S. At the close of a
                    very imperfect school education he was apprenticed by his father at a
                    considerable premium to a firm of grocers in the city; but on the death of the
                    elder Howard in September 1742, by which he inherited considerable property, he
                    bought up his indenture and devoted more than a year to foreign travel, during
                    which he acquired some knowledge of French. Never constitutionally strong, he on
                    his return to England settled in lodgings at Stoke Newington as a confirmed
                    valetudinarian, his days being spent for the most part in hypochondriac idleness
                    (for little importance can be attached to what have sometimes been called his
                    studies in medicine and meteorology). Having been nursed through an acute
                    illness by an attentive landlady, a widow of some fifty-three years of age, he
                    felt that he could offer no adequate return short of marriage for her motherly
                    kindness, and they were united accordingly in 1752. Left a widower in less than
                    three years, Howard broke up his establishment at Stoke Newington in 1755, and
                    resolved to go abroad, the recent occurrence of the earthquake at Lisbon
                    attracting him to Portugal. The ship, however, in which he sailed was so
                    unfortunate as tobe taken by a French privateer, by whom both crew and
                    passengers were carried to Brest, where they were treated with great harshness
                    and almost starved. At Morlaix and at Carhaix Howard had further opportunities
                    of observing the treatment to which prisoners of war were usually at that time
                    subjected; and when permitted on parole to return to England to negotiate an
                    exchange for himself, he not only accomplished his personal object, but also
                    successfully represented the case of those who had been his fellow-captives.
                    Abandoning for the time his Lisbon scheme, he now retired to his property at
                    Cardington, where he continued to interest himself in meteorological
                    observation, for some slight notes on which he obtained publication in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society, of which he had been
                    admitted a member in 1756. After his marriage (April 1758) to Henrietta, eldest
                    daughter of Edward Leeds of Croxton, Cambridgeshire, he continued to live a
                    secluded life, partly at Cardington and partly on another property which he had
                    purchased at Watcombe, Hampshire. In both places he distinguished himself as a
                    kind landlord, and at Cardington especially he displayed a highly enlightened
                    philanthropy in his efforts to raise the condition of the poor by the
                    construction of model cottages and by the erection of schools. In March 1765 his
                    home was again desolated by the sudden and unexpected death of his wife, a few
                    days after she had given birth to a son, her first and only child; and soon
                    Howard’s drooping health and spirits imperatively demanded a change of air and
                    scene. After visiting Bath and London, he in the spring of 1768 crossed to
                    Holland; and another brief stay at Cardington was followed by a prolonged tour
                    in France, Switzerland, and Italy as far as to Naples, whence he returned in
                    1770 by Germany and the Rhine. Having resumed his former course of life at
                    Cardington, he was in 1773 named high sheriff of Bedford, an office which,
                    although as a nonconformist he was unable to take the usual tests, he resolved
                    to accept. The characteristic work of his life may be said to have now begun.
                    When the assizes were held he did <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0331-0320"/> not content himself with sitting out the trials
                    in open court &gt; his inquisitiveness and his benevolence alike impelled him to
                    visit the jail to which the prisoners had been condemned. Howard found it, like
                    all the prisons of the time, wretchedly defective in all its arrangements; but
                    what chiefly astonished and shocked him was an almost incredible abuse arising
                    out of the circumstance that neither the jailer nor his subordinates were
                    salaried officers, but were dependent for their livelihood on fees which they
                    rigorously exacted from the prisoners themselves. He found it to be a fact that
                    some whom the juries had declared not guilty, others in whom the grand jury had
                    not found even such appearance of guilt as would warrant a trial, others whose
                    prosecutors had failed to appear, were frequently detained in prison for months
                    after they had ceased to be in the position of accused parties, until they
                    should have paid the fees of jail delivery. (See Introduction to <hi
                    rend="italic">The State of the Prisons in England and Wales.)</hi> His prompt
                    application to the justices of the county for a salary to the jailer in lieu of
                    his fees was met by a demand for a precedent for charging the county with such
                    an expense. This he undertook to find if such a thing existed. He went
                    accordingly from county to county until his journey had extended to every town
                    in England which contained a prison, but the object of his search eluded
                    inquiry. He could find no precedent for charging the county with the wages of
                    its servants, but he did find so many abuses in prison management which
                    imagination had never conceived, and so many sufferings of which the general
                    public knew nothing, and of which the law took no account, that he determined to
                    devote to the exposure of those wrongs and the reform of those abuses whatever
                    time and money might be needful. The task cost him a fortune, and the best
                    remaining years of his life. The subject of prison reform, indeed, had not
                    previously been wholly absent from the public mind. As early as the year 1728
                    the House of Commons had appointed a committee to inquire into the state of
                    Newgate, the Marshalsea, and other London prisons, where abuses had come to
                    light which had caused the house to order the arrest of several governors of
                    jails, who were tried for high misdemeanours (see <hi rend="italic">Reports of
                    the Committee Appointed to Inquire into the State of the Gaols,</hi> 1729). Much
                    more recently Popham, member for Taunton, had forced the unwilling legislature
                    at least to discuss the propriety of paying fixed salaries to jailers out of the
                    county rates; but in February 1773 the bill after passing the second reading had
                    been withdrawn with a view to its being again brought forward in an amended
                    form. The way had thus been prepared for a friendly reception to anything Howard
                    might have to say as the result of his investigations; and at the close of his
                    first rapid survey of the English prisons he was, through the influence of the
                    supporters of Popham’s bill, cited to appear before a committee of the whole
                    house in March 1774. After his report had been received and he himself examined
                    upon it, it was moved and carried, on the house resuming, “that John Howard,
                    Esq., be called to the bar, and that Mr Speaker do acquaint him that the House
                    are very sensible of the humanity and zeal which have led him to visit the
                    several jails of this kingdom, and to communicate to the house the interesting
                    observations which he has made on that subject.” Almost immediately an Act was
                    passed which provided for the liberation, free of all charges, of every prisoner
                    against whom the grand jury failed to find a true bill, giving the jailer a sum
                    from the county rate in lieu of the abolished fees. This was followed in June by
                    another requiring justices of the peace to see that the walls and ceilings of
                    all prisons within their jurisdiction were scraped and whitewashed once a year
                    at least; that the rooms were regularly cleaned and ventilated; that infirmaries
                    were provided for the sick, and proper care taken to get them medical advice;
                    that the naked should be clothed; that underground dungeons should be used as
                    little as could be; and generally that such courses should be taken as would
                    tend to restore and preserve the health of the prisoners. It was highly
                    characteristic of the man that, having caused the provisions of the new
                    legislation to be printed at his own private cost in large type, he sent a copy
                    to every jailer and warder in the kingdom, determined that no one should be able
                    to plead ignorance of the law if detected in the violation of its provisions. He
                    then set out upon a new tour of inspection, from which, however, he was brought
                    home by the approach of a general election in September 1774. Siding with those
                    who objected to the American policy of the Government, he had consented to stand
                    as one of the anti-ministerial candidates for Bedford; although, however, he was
                    returned by a narrow majority along with his friend Whitbread, he was unseated
                    after a scrutiny on account of the alleged disqualification of some of those
                    voters who had supported him. He was thus left entirely free for the vigorous
                    prosecution of the special task which he had assigned himself; and he began to
                    have thoughts of publishing the immense mass of facts which he had so
                    industriously collected, and which was still so rapidly accumulating. But after
                    a tour which had extended to Scotland and Ireland, it occurred to him before
                    going into print that his notes would be much enhanced in utility if
                    supplemented with the regulations and arrangements of the more important
                    Continental prisons. In April 1775, accordingly, he set out upon an extended
                    tour through France, the Low Countries, and Germany. At Paris he was at first
                    denied access to the prisons; but by recourse to an old and almost obsolete law
                    of 1717, according to which any person wishing to distribute alms to the
                    prisoners was to be admitted and allowed to dispense his charity with his own
                    hand, he succeeded in inspecting the Bicêtre, the Force l’Évêque, and most of
                    the other places of confinement, the only important exception being the
                    Bastille. With regard to this last, however, he succeeded in obtaining
                    possession of a suppressed pamphlet, which he afterwards translated and
                    published in English, to the unconcealed chagrin of the French authorities. At
                    Ghent he examined with special interest the great Maison de Force, then recently
                    erected; its distinctive features—useful labour, in the profits of which the
                    prisoners had a share, and complete separation of the inmates by night—drew from
                    him the exclamation that it was a “noble institution.” At Amsterdam, as in
                    Holland generally, he was much struck with the comparative absence of crime, a
                    phenomenon which he attributed to the industrial and reformatory treatment there
                    adopted. In Germany he found little that was useful and much that was repulsive;
                    in Hanover and Osnabrück, under the rule of a British sovereign, he even found
                    traces of torture. Returning to England in autumn with his copious notes, he
                    determined, before finally reducing them to order and sending them to press, to
                    undertake another tour of England. This lasted for seven months (November 1775
                    to May 1776), and yielded results so important by way of correction and
                    supplement that he resolved to give his Continental experience the benefit of a
                    similar revision. On this occasion he extended his tour to several of the Swiss
                    cantons. At last in 1777 appeared <hi rend="italic">The State of the Prisons in
                    England and Wales, with Preliminary Observations, and an Account of some Foreign
                    Prisons</hi> (Warrington). It met with a very favourable reception, although its
                    author was fully justified in his statement in the preface tiιat as the journeys
                    were not undertaken for the traveller’s amusement, so the results of them were
                    not published for general entertainment. It consists principally of a mass of
                    minute statistical details, somewhat pedantically accumulated and very
                    unmethodically arranged; its most important section <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0332-0321"/> —that relating to “proposed improvements in the
                    structure and management of prisons ”—constituting less than a tenth part of the
                    whole. One portion of his subject, indeed,— that relating to the ships used for
                    transportation of convicts, —had been to some extent taken out of his hand by
                    the passing in 1776 of the Act authorizing the hulk system; but even in this
                    connexion the appearance of his work was highly opportune. Following within a
                    few years the publication of Beccaria’s work <hi rend="italic">On Crimes and
                    Punishments,</hi> it called public attention to the practical question of the
                    treatment of criminals in a manner which compelled the adoption of remedial or
                    at least of palliative measures, although the full difficulty and delicacy of
                    the problem had not as yet been thoroughly appreciated. One of the most
                    immediate results was that Sir W. Blackstone and Mr Eden were requested to draft
                    a bill for the establishment of penitentiary houses, where by means of solitary
                    imprisonment, accompanied by well-regulated labour and religious instruction,
                    the object of reforming the criminal and inuring him to habits of industry might
                    be successfully pursued. New buildings were manifestly necessary in order that
                    the provisions of such an Act might be carried into effect; and as no one seemed
                    to know how to set about their construction, Howard volunteered to go abroad
                    again and collect plans and other information. On this errand (April 1778) he
                    first went to Amsterdam, and carefully examined the “spinhouses” and
                    “rasp-houses” for which that city was famous; next he traversed Prussia, Saxony,
                    Bohemia, Austria, and Italy, everywhere inspecting prisons, hospitals, and
                    workhouses, and carefully recording the merits and defects of each. In the
                    course of this tour he was received with marked consideration and respect at
                    more than one court; but the personal incident of greatest consequence was one
                    which befel him on a voyage along the Tuscan coast. A sudden and violent storm
                    had compelled the master of the small vessel in which he had taken a passage for
                    Leghorn to seek the shelter of land; cold, wet, and exhausted, passengers and
                    crew reached a little island harbour, but only to find that through fear of the
                    plague (they having sailed from a port supposed to be infected) a landing was
                    refused them. Driven backagain upon the storm, they were carried by its violence
                    to the coast of Algeria, where a similar experience was encountered, permission
                    to enter the harbours there also being peremptorily denied. It was this
                    occurrence which first directed Howard’s attention to the subject which
                    engrossed his attention in after years, and in the investigation of which he
                    ultimately lost his life. Leghorn at last reached, he hastened northwards
                    through Lombardy, France, and Flanders, arriving in England in 1779. The
                    information he had obtained having been placed at the service of the House of
                    Commons, a bill was introduced and passed for building two penitentiary houses
                    in Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, or Essex (as might be afterwards determined), and
                    Howard was appointed first supervisor (19 Geo. III. cap. 74). The scheme,
                    however, did not proceed without friction too trying for his patience: and after
                    much time had been lost in interminable discussions with his colleagues as to
                    the sites of the proposed buildings, he in January 1781 wrote to Lord Bathurst
                    resigning his post before anything practical had been achieved. In 1780 he had
                    published a quarto volume of 220 pages as an appendix (the first) to his <hi
                    rend="italic">State of Prisons</hi>; about the same time also he caused to be
                    printed his translation of the suppressed French pamphlet on the Bastille; but
                    on obtaining release from his employments at home his passion for accumulating
                    statistics urged him to new and more extended Continental tours, as far as to
                    Denmark, Sweden, and Russia in 1781, and to Spain and Portugal in 1783. The
                    results of these journeys (which were full of curious and romantic incidents)
                    were embodied in 1784 in a second appendix, with the publication of which his
                    direct labours in connexion with the subject of prison reform may be said to
                    have ceased. The five remaining years of his life were chiefly devoted to
                    researches on a different though cognate subject, that of the means which ought
                    to be used for prevention of the plague, and for guarding against the
                    propagation of contagious distempers in general. Having at the suggestion of his
                    medical friends provided himself with a list of queries to be put to the
                    physicians in attendance at the lazarettos he proposed to visit, he in November
                    1785 sailed for Holland, and thence travelling through France inspected the
                    great lazaretto at Marseilles, though with considerable difficulty, owing to the
                    unfriendliness of the authorities. He next passed through Florence, Rome, and
                    Naples to Malta, whence he sailed by Zante to Smyrna, where his reputed medical
                    skill opened all the prisons and hospitals to his inspection, and where he had
                    ample opportunities of studying the plague in its most fatal form. He then went
                    to Constantinople, where the fame of his skill had preceded him, and where some
                    further fortunate practice greatly added to his prestige. Declining the
                    hospitalities of the British ambassador, however, he devoted himself entirely to
                    the care of the neglected poor, and persistently forced his way into infected
                    caravanserais and pest-houses whither physician and dragoman alike declined to
                    follow him. At length his researches seemed to be complete; and with a great
                    accumulation of papers and memoranda, he was preparing to return homewards by
                    Vienna, when it occurred to his scrupulous mind that he still lacked one
                    essential qualification for practically dealing with the matter which he had
                    taken in hand; he had not as yet had any personal experience of quarantine
                    discipline. Altering his plans accordingly, he returned to Smyrna, and,
                    deliberately choosing a foul ship, took a passage to Venice that he might there
                    undergo the usual confinement. A protracted voyage of sixty days, during which
                    an attack by pirates gave Howard an opportunity of manifesting in a new form
                    that personal bravery which was one of his characteristics, was followed by a
                    weary term of confinement which enabled him to gain, though at the cost of
                    considerable hardship and suffering, the experience he had desired. While
                    imprisoned in the Venetian lazaretto he received two pieces of intelligence
                    which from very opposite causes gave him acute pain. One was the announcement of
                    a proposal that a statue should be erected commemorative of his services in the
                    cause of humanity; to Howard as “a private man with some peculiarities,”
                    desirous to retire into obscurity and silence, it presented itself as a “hasty
                    and disagreeable measure,” “a distressing affair.” The other was the information
                    that his only son, a youth of twenty-two years of age, after a course of
                    flagrant misconduct, had lost his reason and had been put under restraint.
                    Returning hastily by Trieste and Vienna (where he had a long and singular
                    interview with the emperor Joseph II.), he reached England in February 1787. His
                    first care related to his domestic concerns; after these had been put into such
                    order as they admitted, he set out upon another journey of inspection of the
                    prisons of the United Kingdom, at the same time busying himself in preparing for
                    the press the results of his recent tour. The somewhat rambling work containing
                    them was published in February 1789 at Warrington, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">A n Account of the Principal Lazarettos in Europe: with various
                    Papers relative to the Plague, together with further Observations on some
                    Foreign Prisons and Hospitals, and additional Remarks on the present state of
                    those in Great Britain and Ireland.</hi> In the conclusion (p. 235) he committed
                    with some solemnity the result of his past labours to his country, and announced
                    his intention of again visiting Russia, Turkey, and some other countries, <pb

                    these words, “I am not insensible of the dangers that must attend such a
                    journey. Trusting, however, in the protection of that kind providence which has
                    hitherto preserved me, I calmly and cheerfully commit myself to the disposal of
                    unerring wisdom. Should it please God to cut off my life in the prosecution of
                    this design, let not my conduct be uncandidly imputed to rashness or enthusiasm,
                    but to a serious, deliberate conviction that I am pursuing the path of duty, and
                    to a sincere desire of being made an instrument of more extensive usefulness to
                    my fellow-creatures than could be expected in the narrower circle of a retired
                    life.” The execution of the purpose he had thus expressed was delayed for some
                    time by the necessity for making special arrangements with regard to his private
                    affairs in consequence of the confirmed insanity of his son; but early in July
                    1789 he finally embarked in what proved to be his last journey. Travelling
                    overland from Amsterdam by Hanover, Berlin, Königsberg, and Riga to St
                    Petersburg and Moscow, and so southwards, and visiting in passing the military
                    hospitals that lay on his route, he reached Cherson in November. In the
                    hospitals of this place and of the immediate neighbourhood he found more than
                    enough to occupy his attention while he awaited the means of transit to
                    Constantinople. Towards the end of the year his medical advice was asked in the
                    case of a young lady who was suffering under the camp fever then prevalent, and
                    in attending her he himself took the disease, which terminated fatally on
                    January 20, 1790. “Give me no monument,” he had said, “but lay me quietly in the
                    earth; place a sundial over my grave, and let me be forgotten but a life like
                    his had made such a burial even in a foreign land impossible, and his remains
                    were followed, respectfully and sorrowfully, by many thousands to the grave,
                    where they now lie near the village of Dauphigny on the road to St Nicolas. A
                    statue by Bacon with a suitable inscription was afterwards erected to his memory
                    in St Paul’s, London.</p>
                <p>In personal appearance Howard is described as having been short, thin, and
                    sallow,—unprepossessing apart from the attraction of a penetrating eye and a
                    benevolent smile. “There was an animation in his manner and a quickness in his
                    gait which corresponded with the activity of his mental powers. In his address
                    he was dignified, kind, and condescending, always adapting himself to the
                    persons with whom he conversed; as free from a cringing servility amongst his
                    superiors in station as he was from arrogancy towards those of lower rank”
                    (Field). In point of intellectual ability he cannot be said to have been
                    possessed of more thin the ordinary endowments; nor had education done all that
                    was possible for the development of those which he had. That he was of a deeply
                    religious temperament is abundantly shown by the meagre remains we have of his
                    letters and diaries; while the greater part of his life shows that his
                    enthusiasm of humanity was the unusual yet normal outcome of the sincerest
                    piety. His benevolent impulses were sustained by a rare degree of energy and
                    determination, while they were guided by a remarkable delicacy of tact and an
                    equally remarkable vigour of practical common sense. It would be idle to
                    speculate how far Howard’s work could have been done when it was, and as it was,
                    by a man differently endowed. Doubtless the reforms which he inaugurated were
                    reforms urgently called for by the spirit and enlightenment of his age; but this
                    fact rather enhances than diminishes the imperishable glory which belongs to him
                    of having been the foremost to give an articulate voice to that demand. “In the
                    scale of moral desert the labours of the legislator and the writer are as far
                    below his as earth is below heaven. His kingdom was of a better world; he died a
                    martyr after living an apostle” (Bentham).</p>
