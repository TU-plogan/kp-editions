                    economists of Great Britain, was born at Edinburgh, on the 26th April (O.S.)
                    1711. His father, Joseph Hume or Home, a scion of the noble house of Home of
                    Douglas, was owner of a small estate in Berwickshire, on the banks of the
                    Whitadder, called, from the spring rising in front of the dwelling-house,
                    Ninewells. David was the youngest of a family of three, two sons and a daughter,
                    who after the early death of the father were brought up with great care and
                    devotion by their mother, the daughter of Sir David Falconer, president of the
                    college of justice. She survived till 1749, long enough to see securely
                    established the foundations of the literary fame of the younger son, for whose
                    powers she seems at one time to have entertained no great respect. “Our Davie,”
                    she is reported to have said, perhaps with reference to what seemed his folly in
                    rejecting more lucrative professions than that of literature, “Our Davie ’s a
                    fine good-natured crater, but uncommon wake-minded.”</p>
                <p>Of Hume’s early education little is known beyond what he has himself stated in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Life.</hi> He appears to have entered the Greek classes of
                    the university of Edinburgh in 1723, and, he tells us, “passed through the
                    ordinary course of education with success.” It is uncertain how long he remained
                    at the university, though a passage in the remarkable letter first printed by Mr
                    Burton fixes this with comparative definiteness.<note anchored="true"

                    further than the languages, ends commonly when we are about fourteen or fifteen,
                    I <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"

                    reading.” We may conclude, then, that about the year 1726 Hume returned to
                    Ninewells with a fair knowledge of Latin, slight acquaintance with Greek, and
                    literary tastes decidedly inclining to “books of reasoning and philosophy, and
                    to poetry and the polite authors.” He has nowhere given any indications of an
                    explicit character with regard to his reading, or to the works which contributed
                    most in forming his own opinions; and in his writings, save where the subject is
                    of an historical kind, literary references are conspicuous by their rarity. Yet
                    it seems possible from what we know of the sources open to him, of his own
                    preferences, of the problems with which he first busied himself, and of the
                    general current of his speculations regarding them, to infer with some exactness
                    the course of his studies. It is to be noted that at a very early period of his
                    life the dominant passion had declared itself. The love of literature for its
                    own sake was combined with the keen overmastering desire for a literary
                    reputation. At an unusually early age he had determined for himself his future
                    course, and no inducement was strong enough to make him swerve from it. His
                    temperament, on the whole placid and even phlegmatic, readily inclined him to
                    seek as his mode of life the golden mean, equally removed from such external
                    influences as could distract or disturb contemplative repose. He practised what
                    he taught and learned of the Stoic rules, and was concerned only to obtain such
                    external fortune as would place him above the necessity of wasting his powers on
                    temporary and transient objects. His prudence was as remarkable as his
                    moderation; and his life, on the whole, may be regarded as one of the most
                    perfect and successful instances of constant devotion to literary aims. While he
                    was thus fortunate in choosing early and maturely the object towards which all
                    his industry was to be directed, he was no less fortunate in the selection of
                    the special form of literary work to which he was to devote himself. It is clear
                    that his inclinations at a very early age led him towards the analysis of human
                    nature, from which all his later writings take their origin. Speculation upon
                    the nature and certainty of knowledge, whether in its abstract form, that of
                    mere psychology, or in its more concrete applications, as in theology, seems to
                    have been the earliest occupation of his thought; and in this speculation we
                    cannot doubt he was directed largely by the writings of Cicero and Seneca,
                    though the main factor was unquestionably the great English works which had
                    begun to exert their influence at the time. While we trace the matter of Hume’s
                    later reflexions to Locke, Berkeley, and Butler, we must not overlook the great
                    part in his mental development which is due to the sceptical or academical
                    writings of the earlier thinkers. The philosophical treatises of Cicero were
                    familiar to Hume, whose writings have a colouring .undeniably due to this
                    source. The form in which he cast some of the most important of his speculations
                    is an imitation, more or less conscious, of these ancient models.</p>
                <p>We see Hume, then, in the years during which the influences that mould a man’s
                    character and career are most actively at work, resolutely devoting himself to a
                    life of literature, possessed by the most intense ambition for literary fame,
                    and busying himself with reflexion upon those problems of “philosophy and
                    critics” in which, as he found, “nothing was yet established.” His means were
                    slender, and it was necessary for him, even in view of his primary object, to
                    endeavour after independence. The first choice of a profession, that of law,
                    made for him by his relatives, who thought it suited to his “studious habits,
                    sobriety, and industry,” proved unsuccessful. Although his intellect was acute
                    and practical, yet at this period he was so entirely devoted to the more subtle
                    and speculative problems that law could present nothing beyond a barren waste of
                    technical jargon. While his friends thought “he was poring over Voet and
                    Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors he was secretly devouring.” The
                    intensity of his studies, the agitation due to the novelty of the ideas which
                    began to crowd upon him as he tried to carry out systematically the first
                    principles of human knowledge which he learned from Locke and Berkeley, combined
                    to throw him for a time into a state of physical exhaustion and lassitude. His
                    health was gradually restored by more careful regimen; but, as we learn from the
                    curious diagnosis he made of his own state, the vigour requisite for protracted
                    and connected speculation seemed to have vanished. “I have collected,” he
                    writes, the “rude materials for many volumes; but in reducing these to words,
                    when one must bring the idea he comprehended in gross nearer to him, so as to
                    contemplate its minutest parts, and keep it steadily in his eye, so as to copy
                    these parts in order, this I found impracticable for me, nor were my spirits
                    equal to so severe an employment.” In these circumstances he determined to try
                    the effect of complete change of scene and occupation. “I resolved to seek out a
                    more active life, and, though I could not quit my pretensions to learning but
                    with my last breath, to lay them aside for some time, in order the more
                    effectually to resume them.” The effectual remedy which commended itself to him
                    was the trial of a mercantile life, and early in 1734 he set out for Bristol,
                    armed with recommendations to some eminent merchants. A residence of a few
                    months was sufficient to convince him that in this attempt at least he had not
                    hit the mark. He found “the scene wholly unsuitable” to him, and about the
                    middle of the year 1734 set out for France, resolved to spend some years in
                    quiet study and retirement. He visited Paris, resided for a time at Rheims, and
                    then settled at La Flèche, famous in the history of philosophy as the school of
                    Descartes. His health seems to have been perfectly restored, and during the
                    three years of his stay in France his speculations were worked into systematic
                    form in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Human Nature.</hi> In the autumn of
                    1737 he was in London negotiating with publishers and printers regarding the
                    appearance of his great work, and carefully pruning and polishing it in
                    preparation for the judgments of the learned. In January 1739 there appeared the
                    first and second volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Human Nature,
                    being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral
                    Subjects,</hi> containing book i., <hi rend="italic">Of the Understanding,</hi>
                    and book <hi rend="italic">n.,Of the Passions.</hi> The third volume, containing
                    book iii., <hi rend="italic">Of Morals,</hi> was published in the following
                    year. Few phrases are better known than the laconic sentence in which Hume,
                    looking back on his own life, tells the tale of his first venture. “Never
                    literary attempt was more unfortunate; it fell <hi rend="italic">dead-born from
                    the press,</hi> without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur
                    among the zealots.” “But,” he adds, “being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine
                    temper, I very soon recovered the blow, and prosecuted with great ardour my
                    studies in the country.” This brief notice, however, is not sufficient to
                    explain the full significance of the event for Hume’s own life. The work
                    undoubtedly failed to do what its author expected from it; even the notice,
                    otherwise not unsatisfactory, which it obtained in the <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Works of the Learned,</hi> then the principal critical journal, did not
                    in the least appreciate the true bearing of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi>
                    on the current philosophical and theological discussions. Hume, who had been
                    living in abstractions, to whom the disputes of the time had presented
                    themselves in their real nature as fundamental differences of philosophical
                    analysis, naturally expected that the w orld would see with as great clearness
                    as he did the connexion between the concrete problems agitating contemporary
                    thought and the abstract principles on which their solution depended.
                    Accordingly he looked for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0359-0348"/> the intensest opposition, and expected that, if
                    his principles were received, the greatest of revolutions, a change in general
                    conceptions of things, would ensue. Apart from all considerations of personal
                    reputation, which undoubtedly had no small influence on him, he was, therefore,
                    on the eve of the publication of his work, with justice perturbed “at the
                    nearness and greatness of the event.” It is true that in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise</hi> there is little or no direct reference to the theological
                    questions which were then prolific in the production of literature, and probably
                    this omission contributed towards the first failure of the work; but Hume, as
                    before said, is invariably chary of his references, and one cannot doubt that he
                    was himself fully alive to the fact that in his philosophic analysis the matters
                    in debate in the theological world had been reduced to their purest essence, had
                    been brought back to first principles. Overlooking, then, the obvious fact that
                    nothing is less common than systematic thinking, that the greater portion of
                    opinion rests on the accidents of training and surroundings rather than on
                    clearly perceived and rationally tested grounds, he anticipated an immediate and
                    vehement onslaught on his work. His disappointment was great in proportion to
                    the height of his expectations; and though he never entirely relinquished his
                    metaphysical speculations, though all that is of value in his later writings
                    depends on the acute analysis of human nature to which he was from the first
                    attracted, one cannot but regret that his high powers were henceforth withdrawn
                    for the most part from the consideration of the foundations of belief, and
                    expended on its practical applications. In later years he was accustomed to
                    explain his want of success as due to the immature style of his early thoughts
                    and exposition, to the rashness of a young innovator in an old and
                    well-established province of literature. “So vast an undertaking, planned before
                    I was one-and-twenty, and composed before twenty-five, must necessarily be very
                    defective.” The disclaimer of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> in the preface
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry concerning Human Understanding</hi> is well
                    known. But all this has little foundation beyond the personal irritation of an
                    author at his own failure to attract such attention as he deems his due. None of
                    the principles of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> are given up in the later
                    writings, and no addition was made to them. Nor can the superior polish of the
                    more mature productions overbalance the freshness and concentrate! vigour of the
                    more youthful work, Hume is at his best in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi>;
                    and it is curious to think what might have been the position of British
                    philosophy at the close of the 18th century had the success of his first attempt
                    encouraged him to continue with equal zeal and undivided attention his early
                    metaphysical speculations.</p>
                <p>After the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> Hume retired to his
                    brother’s house at Ninewells and carried on his studies, mainly in the direction
                    of politics and political economy, adding to this, however, a wide if not exact
                    reading in classical literature. In 1741 he published the first volume of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> which had a considerable and immediate success. A
                    second edition was called for in the following year, in which also a second
                    volume was published. It is interesting to learn from one of Hume’s letters that
                    Butler, to whom he had sent a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> but
                    with whom he had failed to make personal acquaintance, warmly commended the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays</hi> to all his friends. The philosophical relation between
                    Butler and Hume is one of the curious points in history. So far as analysis of
                    knowledge is concerned both are in thorough harmony, and Hume’s sceptical
                    conclusions regarding belief in matters of fact are the foundations on which
                    Butler’s defence of religion rests. Butler, however, appears to retain,
                    alongside of his destructive theory of knowledge, confidence in the rational
                    proofs for the existence of God, and certainly maintains what may be vaguely
                    described as an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> view of conscience. It is
                    probable that, though Butler never worked out the system of his belief, his
                    theological principles will be found to rest ultimately on ethical grounds. Hume
                    had the greatest respect for the author of the <hi rend="italic">Analogy,</hi>
                    ranks him with Locke and Berkeley as the originators of the experimental method
                    in moral science, and in his specially theological essays, such as that on <hi
                    rend="italic">Particular Providence and a Future State,</hi> has Butler’s views
                    specifically in mind. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Butler.</hi></p>
                <p>The success of the <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> though, hardly great enough to
                    satisfy the author’s somewhat exorbitant cravings, was a great encouragement to
                    Hume. He began to hope that his earlier and heavier work, if recast and
                    lightened, might share the fortunes of its successor; and at intervals
                    throughout the next four years he occupied himself in reducing its fundamental
                    principles into a more succinct form, and in giving to them all the literary
                    grace at his command. Meantime he continued to look about for some post which
                    might secure him the modest independence he desired. In 1744 we find him, in
                    anticipation of a vacancy in the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh
                    university, moving his friends to do him good offices with the electors; and
                    though, as he tell us, “the accusation of heresy, deism, scepticism, or theism,
                    &amp;c., &amp;c., was started” against him, it had no effect, “being bore down
                    by the contrary authority of all the good people in town.” To his great
                    mortification, however, he thought he could discover that Hutcheson and
                    Leechman, with whom he had been on terms of friendly correspondence, were giving
                    the weight of their opinion against the propriety of electing him to such a
                    post. The after history of these negotiations is obscure. Hume in all
                    probability perceived that fortune was against him, and accepted in 1745 a very
                    anomalous post, that of tutor or guardian or keeper to the marquis of Annandale,
                    a harmless literary lunatic. Although the salary paid during the year Hume spent
                    in this capacity “made a considerable accession” to his fortune, the position
                    was unmistakably false and painful. The letters relating to this episode of his
                    life, first printed by Dr Thomas Murray, 1841 (see Burton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life,</hi> i. ch. v.), are not pleasant reading; and the close of the connexion
                    between Hume and his pupil left the philosopher under the necessity of
                    instituting an action for recovery of arrears due to him. The details of the
                    affair are not sufficiently clear to enable a modern judge to assign either
                    admiration or blame to Hume’s tenacity in the matter of his rights.</p>
                <p>In 1746 Hume accepted the office of secretary to General St Clair, and was a
                    spectator of the ill-fated expedition to France in the autumn of that year. His
                    admirable account of the transaction has been printed by Mr Burton. After a
                    brief sojourn at Ninewells, doubtless occupied in preparing for publication his
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essays</hi> (afterwards entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">An Inquiry concerning Human Understanding},</hi> Hume was again
                    associated with General St Clair, and in 1748 accompanied him as secretary in
                    the embassy to Vienna and Turin. The notes of this journey are written in a
                    light and amusing style, showing Hume’s usual keenness of sight in some
                    directions and his almost equal blindness in others. During his absence from
                    England, early in the year 1748, the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essays</hi>
                    were published; but, to his great disappointment, the first reception of the
                    work was little more favourable than that accorded to the unfortunate <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise.</hi> “On my return from Italy,” he writes, “I had the
                    mortification to find all England in a ferment on account of Dr Middleton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Free Inquiry,</hi> while my performance was entirely overlooked
                    and neglected.” To the later editions of the work Hume prepared an
                    “Advertisement” referring to the <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> and desiring
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> “may alone be regarded as containing his
                    philosophical sentiments and principles.” Not a few modern critics have accepted
                    this disclaimer as of real value, but <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0360-0349"/> in fact it has no significance; and Hume has
                    himself in a striking letter to Gilbert Elliott indicated the true relation of
                    the two works. “I believe. the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essays</hi>
                    contain everything of consequence relating to the understanding which you would
                    meet with in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> and I give you my advice
                    against reading the latter. By shortening and simplifying the questions, I
                    really render them much more complete. <hi rend="italic">Addo dum minuo.</hi>
                    The philosophical principles are the same in both.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essays</hi> are undoubtedly written with more maturity and skill than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise</hi>; they contain in more detail application of the
                    principles to concrete problems, such as miracles, providence, immortality; but
                    the entire omission of the discussion forming part ii. of the first book of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> and the great compression of part iv., are real
                    defects which must always render the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> the more
                    important work in the history of philosophy.</p>
                <p>In 1749 Hume returned to England, enriched with “near a thousand pounds.” Two
                    years he spent at N^inewells, and then in 1751 removed to Edinburgh, where for
                    the most part he resided during the next twelve years of his life. These years
                    are the richest so far as literary production is concerned. In 1751 he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Political Discourses,</hi> which had a great and
                    well-deserved success. In the same year appeared the recast of the third book of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Inquiry concerning
                    the Principles of Morals,</hi> of which he says that “of all his writings,
                    philosophical, literary, or historical, it is incomparably the best.” At this
                    time also we hear of the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues concerning Natural
                    Religion,</hi> a work which Hume was prevailed on not to publish, but which he
                    touched and retouched with the greatest care, and evidently regarded with the
                    greatest favour. The work itself, left by Hume with instructions that it should
                    be published, did not appear till 1779.</p>
                <p>In 1751 Hume was again unsuccessful in the attempt to gain a professor’s chair. A
                    candidate unknown to fame then or afterwards was appointed to the chair of logic
                    at Glasgow. In the following year he received the first public preferment that
                    had ever fallen to his lot, the librarianship of the Advocates’Library in
                    Edinburgh, small in emoluments, but rich in opportunity for literary work. His
                    delight was great. In his playful style he writes to Dr Clephane, “I have been
                    ready to burst with vanity and self-conceit this week past, and, being obliged
                    from decorum to keep a strict watch over myself and check all emphasis of that
                    kind, I really begin to find my health injured by it.” The usual objections had
                    been raised to his election without avail; but, “what is more extraordinary, the
                    cry of religion could not hinder the ladies from being violently my partisans,
                    and I owe my success in a great measure to their solicitations. One has broke
                    off all commerce with her lover because he voted against me; and W. Lockhart, in
                    a speech to the faculty, said that there was no walking the streets, nor even
                    enjoying one’s own fireside, on account of their importunate zeal. The town says
                    that even his bed was not safe for him, though his wife was cousin-german to my
                    antagonist.”</p>
                <p>The only work published at this time which requires somewhat special notice is
                    the set of essays called <hi rend="italic">Political Discourses.</hi> In these
                    Hume shows greater aptitude for economical inquiries, and makes greater advances
                    in political economy, than any previous writer. Although only a few of the many
                    subjects of discussion are touched upon, the general principles of the science
                    are firmly expressed and illustrated with clearness that leaves nothing to be
                    desired. The fundamental theorem, “everything in the world is purchased by
                    labour, and our passions are the only causes of labour,” on which Smith
                    afterwards constructed his more elaborate system, is used as the key to resolve
                    the difficulties regarding the advantages of foreign trade, the causes of the
                    efflux and influx of bullion, the general range of prices in a country, the
                    influence of credit on prices and on trade, the connexion of interest, profits,
                    and the general conditions of industry, and the most economical modes of levying
                    taxes. In many respects the analysis of the complex phenomena of commerce is
                    more sound and thorough than that given in the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of
                    Nations,</hi> for Hume never forgets that the ultimate causes of our economic
                    movements are the “customs and manners” of the people, and always finds his
                    solution by referring to the elementary factors of industry. It is curious that
                    on the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> Hume
                    indicated to Smith that he differed from him regarding the influence of rent on
                    prices, the point from which the later advances of English political economy
                    have taken their start. It is also remarkable that Hume had formed a much
                    sounder judgment than Smith on the merits of the French Economists. In short,
                    the main errors of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> are to be found
                    in the deviations from the principles of the <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Discourses.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1753 Hume was fairly settled in Edinburgh, enjoying the dignity and delights
                    of householding, and preparing for his new attempt in literature, the <hi

                    writes to Dr Clephane, “I got a house of my own, and. completed a regular
                    family, consisting of a head, viz., myself, and two inferior members, a maid and
                    a cat. My sister has since joined me, and keeps me company. With frugality I can
                    reach, I find, cleanliness, warmth, light, plenty, and contentment. What would
                    you have more? Independence? I have it in a supreme degree. Honour? That is not
                    altogether wanting. Grace? That will come in time. A wife? That is none of the
                    indispensable requisites of life. Books? That is one of them; and I have more
                    than I can use. In short, I cannot find any blessing of consequence which I am
                    not possessed of in a greater or less degree; and without any great effort of
                    philosophy, I may be easy and satisfied. As there is no happiness without
                    occupation, I have begun a work which will employ me several years, and which
                    yields'me much satisfaction. ’ Tis a history of Great Britain, from the Union of
                    the Crowns to the present time. I have already finished the reign of King James
                    I. My friends flatter me (by which I mean that they don’t flatter' me) that I
                    have succeeded. You know that there is no post of honour in the English
                    Parnassus more vacant than that of history. Style, judgment, impartiality, care
                    —everything is wanting in our historians; and even Rapin, during this latter
                    period, is extremely deficient. I make my work very concise, after the manner of
                    the ancients. It divides into three very moderate volumes: one to end with the
                    death of Charles the First; the second at the Revolution; the third at the
                    Accession, for I dare come no nearer the present times. The work will neither
                    please the duke of Bedford nor James Fraser; but I hope it will please you and
                    posterity. Kτ⅞∕tα <hi rend="italic">tls cut.”</hi></p></note> He had decided to
                    begin the <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> not with Henry VII., as Adam Smith
                    recommended, but with James I., considering that the political differences and
                    parties of .his time took their origin from that period, and that then, as he
                    thought, “the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place.” On the
                    whole his attitude in respect to disputed political principles seems not to have
                    been at first consciously unfair. “I am sensible,” he writes to Clephane, “that
                    the history of the two first Stuarts will be most agreeable to the Tories, that
                    of the two last to the Whigs; but we must endeavour to be above any regard
                    either to Whigs or Tories.” As for the qualities necessary to secure success as
                    a <hi rend="italic">writer</hi> on history, he felt that he possessed them in a
                    high degree; and, though neither his ideal of an historian nor his equipment for
                    the task of historical research would now appear adequate, in both he was much
                    in advance of his contemporaries and predecessors. Naturally, then, he was
                    “sanguine in his expectations of the success of his work.” “But,” he writes in
                    the well-known passage of his <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> “miserable was my
                    disappointment. I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even
                    detestation;,. . . what was still more mortifying, the book seemed to sink into
                    oblivion. Mr Millar told me that in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0361-0350"/> a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of
                    it.” This account must be accepted with great qualification. It expresses Hume’s
                    feelings rather than the real facts. In Edinburgh, as we learn from one of his
                    letters, the book succeeded well, no fewer than 450 copies being disposed of in
                    five weeks. Nor is there anything in Hume’s correspondence to show that the
                    failure of the book was so complete as he declared it to have been. Within a
                    very few years the sale of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> was sufficient to
                    gain for the author a larger revenue than had ever before been known in his
                    country to flow from literature, and to place him in comparative affluence. At
                    the same time the bitterness of Hume’s feelings and their effect are of
                    importance in his life. It is from the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> that we date the extraordinary virulence of his hatred towards
                    everything English, towards society in London, Whig principles, Whig ministers,
                    and the public generally.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    society. The little company there that is worth conversing with are cold and
                    unsociable, or are warmed only by faction and cabal; so that a man who plays no
                    part in public aifairs becomes altogether insignificant; and, if he is not rich,
                    he becomes even contemptible. Hence that nation are fast relapsing into the
                    deepest stupidity and ignorance. ”—Burton, ii. 268. “There are fine doings in
                    America. 0! how 1 long to see America and the East Indies revolted, totally and
                    finally—the revenue reduced to half—public credit fully discredited by

                    of provocation on our part. It has frequently made me resolve never in my life

                    148, 238. Perhaps our knowledge of Johnson’s sentiments regarding the Scotch in
                    general, and of his expressions regarding Hume and Smith in particular, may
                    lessen our sur-prise at this vehemence.</p></note> As a consequence of these
                    strong feelings, the remainder of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> became
                    little better than a party pamphlet, written with a definite bias and a definite
                    aim. The second volume, published in 1756, carrying on the narrative to the
                    Revolution, was better received than the first; but Hume then resolved to work
                    backwards, and to show from a survey of the Tudor period that his Tory notions
                    were grounded upon the history of the constitution. In 1759 this portion of the
                    work appeared, and in 1761 the work was completed by the history of the
                    pre-Tudor periods. The numerous editions of the various portions,—for, despite
                    Hume’s wrath and grumblings, the book was a great literary success,—gave him an
                    opportunity of careful revision, which he employed to remove from it all the
                    “villainous seditious Whig strokes,” and “plaguy prejudices of Whiggism” that he
                    could detect lurking in it. In other words, he bent all his efforts towards
                    making his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> more of a party work than it had
                    originally been, and in his effort he was entirely successful. It has been the
                    business of subsequent historians to correct his misrepresentations so far as
                    they referred to the period of which he had fair knowledge, and to supersede his
                    accounts of those periods which his insufficient knowledge disabled him from
                    treating in a manner worthy of him. The early portion of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> may be regarded as now of little or no value. The sources at
                    Hume’s command were few, and he did not even use them all. None the less, the
                    <hi rend="italic">History</hi> has a distinct place in the literature of
                    England. It was the first attempt at a really comprehensive and thoughtful
                    treatment of historic facts, the first to introduce the social and literary
                    aspects of a nation’s life as of importance only second to its political
                    fortunes, and the first historical writing in an animated yet refined and
                    polished style. It has received from later writers its due meed of praise and
                    blame.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We append the
                    judgment of Macaulay on Hume's characteristic fault as an historian :—“Hume is
                    an accomplished advocate. Without positively asserting much more than he can
                    prove, he gives prominence to all the circumstances which support his case; he
                    glides lightly over those which are unfavourable to it; his own witnesses are
                    applauded and encouraged; the statements which seem to throw discredit on them
                    are controverted; the contradictions into which they fall are explained away; a
                    clear and connected abstract of their evidence is given. Everything that is
                    offered on the other-side is scrutinized with the utmost severity; every
                    suspicious circumstance is a ground for argument and invective; what cannot be
                    denied is extenuated, or passed by without notice; concessions even are
                    sometimes made; but this insidious candour only increases the effect of the vast
                    mass of sophistry.”— <hi rend="italic">Miscell. Writings, “</hi> History.” With
                    this may be compared the more favourable verdict by the late Prof. Brewer, in
                    the nreface to his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Student's
                    Hume.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>While the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> was in process of publication, Hume did
                    not entirely neglect his other lines of activity. In 1757 appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">Four Dissertations: The Natural History of Religion, Of the
                    Passions, Of Tragedy, Of the Standard of Taste.</hi> Of these the dissertation
                    on the passions is a very subtle piece of psychology, containing the essence of
                    the second book of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise.</hi> It is remarkable that
                    Hume does not appear to have been acquainted with Spinoza’s analysis of the
                    affections. The last two essays are contributions of no great importance to
                    aesthetics, a department of philosophy in which Hume was not strong. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural History of Religion</hi> is a powerful contribution to the
                    deistie controversy; but, as in the case of Hume’s earlier work, its
                    significance was at the time overlooked. It is an attempt to carry the war
                    directly into a province hitherto allowed to remain at peace, the theory of the
                    general development of religious ideas. Deists, though raising doubts regarding
                    the historic narratives of the Christian faith, had never disputed the general
                    fact that belief in one God was natural and primitive. Hume endeavours to show
                    that polytheism was the earliest as well as the most natural form of religious
                    belief, and that theism or deism is the product of reflexion upon experience,
                    thus reducing the validity of the historical argument to that of the theoretical
                    proofs.</p>
                <p>In 1763 he accompanied Lord Hertford to Paris, doing the duties of secretary to
                    the embassy, with the prospect of the appointment to that post. He was
                    everywhere received “with tlιe most extraordinary honours in fact, he was
                    “lionized.” The society of Paris was peculiarly ready to receive a great
                    philosopher and historian, especially if he were known to be an avowed
                    antagonist of religion. Hume basked in the sunshine of his popularity; but at
                    the same time he made some valuable friendships, especially with D’Alembert and
                    Turgot, the latter of whom admired sincerely and profited much by Hume’s
                    economical essays. In 1766 he left Paris and returned to Edinburgh; but in the
                    following year (1767) he accepted the post of undersecretary to General Conway,
                    and spent two years in London. He settled finally in Edinburgh in 1769, having
                    now through his pension and otherwise the handsome fortune of ,£1000 a year. The
                    solitary incident of note in this period of his life is the ridiculous quarrel
                    with Rousseau, an episode still amusing, and throwing much light upon the
                    strange character of the great sentimentalist. Hume certainly did his utmost to
                    secure for Rousseau a comfortable retreat in England, but his usually sound
                    judgment seems at first to have been quite at fault with regard to his protégé.
                    That is surely an amusing likeness which Hume discovered between Rousseau and
                    Socrates; and it is interesting to note the conflict between his preconceived
                    opinion <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n362/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0362-0351"/> and that which detached circumstances gave him
                    occasion to form. He finds “Rousseau a very modest, mild, well-bred,
                    gentle-spirited, aud warm hearted man as ever I knew in my life,” and thinks he
                    “could live with him all his life in mutual friendship and esteem.” At the same
                    time he cannot avoid remarking that Rousseau “is a great humorist” <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> full of caprices); that though “he intends seriously
                    to draw his own picture in its true colours . . . nobody knows himself less;”
                    that he would be unhappy in solitude, “as he has, indeed, been always in all
                    situations.” The quarrel which all the acquaintances of the two philosophers had
                    predicted soon came, and no language had expressions strong enough for
                    Rousseau’s hatred and distrust of his protector. Hume, it must be admitted, came
                    well out of the business, and had the sagacity to conclude that, after all, his
                    admired friend was little better than a madman.</p>
                <p>In 1769 Hume settled in Edinburgh, and in one of his most delightful letters he
                    gives an animated description of the domestic economy of his later years.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“I live still, and must for a

                    which I intend to addict the remaining years of my life! I have just now lying

                    like him. All my friends encourage me in this ambition, as thinking it will
                    redound very much to my honour.”</p></note> The house alluded to as that to
                    which he was about to remove was built under his own directions at the corner of
                    what is new called St David Street; and we may picture it to ourselves as being,
                    during the closing period of Hume’s life, the centre of the most lively and
                    cultivated society of Edinburgh. The gay and cheerful temper of the philosopher,
                    his unfailing equanimity, and the solid goodness of his heart had made him many
                    friends, even among those who dissented most from his religious views. The
                    resolute strength with which he pushed speculation to its limits was combined
                    with a perfect gentleness of disposition and an amiability that endeared him to
                    all who had the pleasure of knowing him. He was singularly free from jealousy,
                    and no feature of his character is more attractive than the unfailing cordiality
                    with which he welcomed the literary successes of those who might have been
                    thought his rivals. To Robertson and Smith, his personal friends, he is open and
                    unrestrained in his praise and commendation; and his good services were ever
                    exerted in their cause. To opponents of whose merits he was convinced, to
                    Campbell and Reid, he was cordial and generous. His respect for his own
                    profession led him always to encourage those who had engaged their fortunes in
                    the perilous hazard pf literary success, and to extend to them his good offices.
                    For Blackwell and for Smollett, in their misfortunes, he exerted himself to the
                    utmost. Nor was he without his recompense. During the closing decade of his life
                    he was the acknowledged patriarch of literature; the veneration and respect of
                    his friends, for his character no less than for his abilities, were unbounded.
                    The “gaiety of his temper,” says Adam Smith, “so agreeable in society, and which
                    is so often accompanied with frivolous and superficial qualities, was in him
                    certainly attended with the most severe application, the most extensive
                    learning, the greatest depth of thought, and a capacity in every respect the
                    most comprehensive. Upon the whole, I have always considered him, both in his
                    lifetime and since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a
                    perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will
                    permit.”</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1775 Hume was struck with a tedious and harassing though not
                    painful illness. A visit to Bath seemed at first to have produced good effects,
                    but on the return journey northwards more alarming symptoms developed
                    themselves, his strength rapidly sank, and, little more than a month alter he
                    had reached Edinburgh, he died (25th August 1776).</p>
                <p>No notice of Hume would be complete without the sketch of his character drawn by
                    his own hand :—“To conclude historically with my own character, I am, or rather
                    was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which emboldens
                    me the more to speak my sentiments),—I was, I say, a man of mild dispositions,
                    of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of
                    attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my
                    passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my
                    temper, notwithstanding my’ frequent disappointments. My company was not
                    unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary;
                    and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no
                    reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word,
                    though most men anywise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny, I
                    never was touched, or even attacked, by her baleful tooth; and, though I
                    wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they
                    seem to be disarmed on my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had
                    occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct; not but
                    that the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent and
                    propagate any story to my disadvantage, but they could never find any which they
                    thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in
                    making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and
                    this is a matter of fact which is easily cleansed and ascertained.” The more his
                    life has become known, the more confidence we place in this admirable
                    estimate.</p>
                <p>The philosophical writings of Hume, which mark a distinct epoch in the
                    development of modern thought, can here be considered in two only of the many
                    aspects in which they present themselves as of the highest interest to the
                    historian of philosophy. In the <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Human Nature,</hi>
                    which is in every respect the most complete exposition of Hume’s philosophical
                    conception, we have the first thorough-going attempt to apply the fundamental
                    principles of Locke’s empirical psychology to the construction of a theory of
                    knowledge, and, as a natural consequence, the first systematic criticism of the
                    chief metaphysical notions from this point of view. Hume, in that work, holds
                    the same relation to Locke and Berkeley as the late J. 8. Mill held with his <hi
                    rend="italic">System of Logic</hi> to Hartley and James Mill. In certain of the
                    later writings, pre-eminently in the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues on Natural
                    Religion,</hi> Hume brings the results of his speculative criticism to bear upon
                    the problems of current theological discussion, and gives in their regard as
                    previously with respect to general philosophy the final word of the empirical
                    theory in its earlier form. The. interesting parallel between Hume and J. S.
                    Mill in this second feature will not be overlooked.</p>
                <p>In the first instance, then, Hume’s philosophical work is to be regarded as the
                    attempt to supply for empiricism in psychology a consistent, that is, a
                    logically developed theory of knowledge. In Locke, indeed, such theory is not
                    wanting, but, of all the many inconsistencies in the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    the Human Understanding,</hi> none is more apparent or more significant than the
                    complete want of harmony between the view of knowledge developed in the fourth
                    book and the psychological principles laid down in the earlier part of the work.
                    Though Locke, doubtless, drew no distinction between the problems of psychology
                    and of theory of knowledge, yet the discussion of the various forms of cognition
                    given in the fourth book of the <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> seems to be based
                    on grounds quite distinct from and in many respects inconsistent with the
                    fundamental psychological principle of his work. The perception of relations,
                    which, according to him, is the essence of cognition, the demonstrative
                    character which he thinks attaches to our inference of God’s existence, the
                    intuitive knowledge of self, are doctrines incapable of being brought into
                    harmony with the view of mind and its development which is the keynote of his
                    general theory. To some extent Berkeley removed this radical inconsistency, but
                    in his philosophical work it may be said with safety there are two distinct
                    aspects, and while it holds of Locke on the one hand, it stretches forward to
                    Kantianism on the other. Nor in Berkeley are these divergent features ever
                    united into one harmonious whole. It was left for Hume to approach the theory of
                    knowledge with full consciousness from the psychological point of view, and to
                    work out the final consequences of that view so far as cognition is concerned.
                    The terms which he employs in describing the aim and scope of his work are not
                    those which we should now employ, but the declaration, in the introduction to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> that the Science of human nature must be
                    treated according to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n363/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0363-0352"/> experimental method, is in fact equivalent to the
                    statement of the principle implied in Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> that
                    the problems of psychology and of theory of knowledge are identical. And this
                    view is the characteristic of what we may call the English school of
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>In order to make perfectly clear the full significance of the principle which
                    Hume applied to the solution of the chief philosophical questions, it is
                    necessary to render somewhat, more precise and complete the statement of the
                    psychological view which lies at the foundation of the empirical theory, and to
                    distinguish from it the problem of the theory of knowledge upon which it was
                    brought to bear. Without entering into details, which it is the less necessary
                    to do because the subject has been recently discussed with great fulness in
                    works readily accessible, it may be said that for Locke as for Hume the problem
                    cf psychology was the exact description of the contents of the individual mind,
                    and the determination of the conditions of the origin and development of
                    conscious experience in the individual mind. And the answer to the problem which
                    was furnished by Locke is in effect that with which Hume started. The conscious
                    experience of the individual is the result of interaction between the individual
                    mind and the universe of things. It is evident that this solution presupposes a
                    peculiar conception of the general relation betλveen the mind and things which
                    in itself requires justification, and which, so far at least as the empirical
                    theory was developed by Locke and his successors, could not be obtained from
                    psychological analysis. Either we have a right to the assumption contained in
                    the conception of the individual mind as standing in relation to things, in
                    which case the grounds of the assumption must be sought elsewhere than in the
                    results of this reciprocal relation, or we have no right to the assumption, in
                    which case reference to the reciprocal relation can hardly be accepted as
                    yielding any solution of the psychological problem. But in any case,—and, as we
                    shall see, Hume endeavours so to state his psychological premises as to conceal
                    the assumption made openly by Locke,—it is apparent that this psychological
                    solution does not contain the answer to the wider and radically distinct problem
                    of the theory of knowledge. For here we have to consider how the individual
                    intelligence comesto know any fact whatsoever, and what is meant by the
                    cognition of a fact. With Locke, Hume professes to regard this problem as
                    virtually covered or answered by the fundamental psychological theorem; but the
                    superior clearness of his reply enables us to mark with perfect precision the
                    nature of the difficulty inherent in the attempt to regard the two as identical.
                    For purposes of psychological analysis the conscious experience of the
                    individual mind is taken as given fact, to be known, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> observed, discriminated, classified, and explained in the same way
                    in which any one special portion of experience is treated. Now if this mode of
                    treatment be accepted as the only possible method, and its results assumed to be
                    conclusive as regards the problem of knowledge, the fundamental peculiarity of
                    cognition is overlooked. In all cognition, strictly so-called, there is involved
                    a certain synthesis or relation of parts of a characteristic nature, and if we
                    attempt to discuss this synthesis as though it were in itself but one of the
                    facts forming the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> of knowledge, we are driven to
                    regard this relation as being of the quite external kind discovered by
                    observation among matters of knowledge. The difficulty of reconciling the two
                    views is that which gives rise to much of the obscurity in Locke’s treatment of
                    the theory of knowledge; in Hume the effort to identify them, and to explain the
                    synthesis which is essential to cognition as merely the accidental result of
                    external relations among the elements of conscious experience, appears with the
                    utmost clearness, and gives the keynote of all his philosophical work. The final
                    perplexity, concealed by various forms of expression, comes forward at the close
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> as absolutely unsolved, and leads Hume,
                    as will be pointed out, to a truly remarkable confession of the weakness of his
                    own system.</p>
                <p>While, then, the general idea of a theory of knowledge as based upon
                    psychological analysis is the groundwork of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi>
                    it is a particular consequence of this idea that furnishes to Hume the
                    characteristic criterion applied by him to all philosophical questions. If the
                    relations involved in the fact of cognition are only those discoverable by
                    observation of any particular portion of known experience, then such relations
                    are quite external and contingent. The only necessary relation which can be
                    discovered in a given fact of experience is that of non-contradiction; the thing
                    must be what it is, and cannot be conceived as having qualities contradictory of
                    its nature. The universal test, therefore, of any supposed philosophical
                    principle, seeing that such principles are but expressions of relations among
                    facts, is the possibility or impossibility of imagining its contradictory. All
                    our knowledge is but the sum of our conscious experience, and is consequently
                    material for imagination. “Let us fix our attention out of ourselves as much as
                    possible; let us chase our imagination to the heavens or to the utmost limits of
                    the universe; we never really advance a step beyond ourselves, nor can conceive
                    any kind of existence, but those perceptions which have appeared in that narrow
                    compass. This is the universe of the imagination, nor have we any idea but what
                    is there produced” <hi rend="italic">(Works,</hi> ed. of 1854, i. 93, <hi
                    rend="italic">cf.</hi> i. 107).</p>
                <p>The course of Hume’s work follows immediately from his fundamental principle, and
                    the several divisions of the treatise, so far as the theoretical portions are
                    concerned, are but its logical consequences. The first part of the first book
                    contains a brief statement of the contents of mind, a description of all that
                    observation can discover in conscious experience. The second part deals with
                    those judgments which rest upon the formal elements of experience, space and
                    time. The third part discusses the principle of real connexion among the
                    elements of experience, the relation of cause and effect. The fourth part is
                    virtually a consideration of the ultimate significance of this conscious
                    experience, of the place it is supposed to occupy in the universe of existence,
                    in other words, of the relations between the conscious experience of an
                    individual mind as disclosed to observation and. the supposed realities of self
                    and external things.</p>
                <p>In the first part Hume gives his own statement of the psychological foundations
                    of his theory. Viewing the contents of mind as matter of experience, he can
                    discover among them only one distinction, a distinction expressed by the terms
                    <hi rend="italic">impressions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ideas.</hi> Ideas are
                    secondary in nature, copies of data supplied we know not whence. All that
                    appears in conscious experience as primary, as arising from some unknown cause,
                    and therefore relatively as original, Hume designates by the term <hi
                    rend="italic">impression,</hi> and claims to imply by such term no theory
                    whatsoever as to the origin of this portion of experience. There is simply the
                    fact of conscious experience, arising we know not how. Moreover, if we remain
                    faithful to the fundamental conception of the contents of mind as being merely
                    matters of experience, it is evident in the first place that as impressions are
                    strictly individual, ideas also must be strictly particular, and in the second
                    place that the faculties of Combining, discriminating, abstracting, and judging,
                    which Locke had admitted, are merely expressions for particular modes of having
                    mental experience, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> are modifications of <hi
                    rend="italic">conceiving (cf.</hi> i. 128 n., 137, 192). Thus at a single stroke
                    Hume removes all the philosophical discussions that had centred round the
                    problem of abstract ideas and the nature of judgment. It is merely by accidental
                    concomitance, which on the subjective side is custom, that one fact, a word,
                    sign, symbol, or type comes to stand for a series of resembling facts, while the
                    comparison of perceptions, with resulting consciousness of their resemblance or
                    difference, is in itself a single, isolated perception (see i. 37, 38, 100).</p>
                <p>Such, in substance, is Hume’s restatement of Locke’s empirical view. Conscious
                    experience consists of isolated states, each of which is as a fact and is
                    related to others in a quite external fashion. It remains to be seen how
                    knowledge can be explained from such a basis; but, before proceeding to sketch
                    Hume’s answer to this question, it is necessary to draw attention, first, to the
                    peculiar device invariably resorted to by him when any exception to his general
                    principle that ideas are secondary copies of impressions presents itself, and,
                    secondly, to the nature of the substitute offered by him for that perception of
                    relations or synthesis which even in Locke’s confused statements had appeared as
                    the essence of cognition. Whenever Hume finds it impossible to recognize in an
                    idea the mere copy of a particular impression, he introduces the phrase “manner
                    of conceiving.” Thus general or abstract ideas are merely copies of a particular
                    impression conceived in a particular manner. The ideas of space and time, as
                    will presently be pointed out, are copies of impressions conceived in a
                    particular manner. The idea of necessary connexion is merely the reproduction of
                    an impression which the mind <hi rend="italic">feels</hi> itself compelled to
                    conceive in a particular manner. Such a fashion of disguising difficulties
                    points, not only to an inconsistency in Hume’s theory as stated by himself, but
                    to the initial error upon which it proceeds; for these perplexities are but the
                    consequences of the doctrine that cognition is to be explained from what can be
                    discovered by observation among the facts of experience, and observation can
                    discover none but external relations. These external relations are, in fact,
                    what Hume describes as the natural bonds of connexion among ideas, and, regarded
                    subjectively as principles of association among facts of mental experience, they
                    form the substitute he offers for the synthesis implied in knowledge. These
                    principles of association determine the imagination to combine ideas in various
                    modes, and by this mechanical combination Hume, for a time, endeavoured to
                    explain what are otherwise called judgments of relation. It was impossible,
                    however, for him to carry out this view consistently. The only combination
                    which, even in appearance, could be explained satisfactorily by its means was
                    the formation of a complex idea out of simpler parts, but it is absurd to
                    describe the idea of a relation among facts as a complex idea; and, as such
                    relations have no basis in impressions, Hume is finally'driven to a confession
                    of the absolute impossibility of explaining them. Such confession, however, is
                    only reached after a vigorous effort had been made to render some account of
                    knowledge by the experimental method.</p>
                <p>The psychological conception, then, on the basis of which Hume proceeds to
                    discuss the theory of knowledge, is that of conscious experience as containing
                    merely the succession of isolated impressions and their fainter copies, ideas,
                    and as bound together by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n364/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0364-0353"/> merely natural or external links of connexion,
                    the principles of association among ideas. The foundations of cognition must be
                    discovered by observation or analysis of experience so conceived. Hume wavers
                    somewhat in his division of the various kinds of cognition, laying stress now
                    upon one now upon another of the points in which mainly they differ from one
                    another. Nor is it of the first importance, save with the view of criticizing
                    his own consistency, that we should adopt any of the divisions implied in his
                    exposition. For practical purposes we may regard the most important discussions
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> as falling under two heads. In the first
                    place there are certain principles of cognition which appear to rest upon and to
                    express relations of the universal elements in conscious experience, viz., space
                    and time. The propositions of mathematics seem to be independent of this or that
                    special fact of experience, and to remain unchanged even when the concrete
                    matter of experience varies. They are formal. In the second place, cognition, in
                    any real sense of that term, implies connexion for the individual mind between
                    the present fact of experience and other facts, whether past or future. It
                    appears to involve, therefore, some real relation among the portions of
                    experience, on the basis of which relation judgments and inferences as to
                    matters of fact can be shown to rest. The theoretical question is consequently
                    that of the nature of the supposed relation, and of the certainty of judgments
                    and inferences resting on it.</p>
                <p>Hume’s well-known distinction between relations of ideas and matters of fact
                    corresponds fairly to this separation of the formal and real problems in the
                    theory of cognition, although that distinction is in itself inadequate and not
                    fully representative of Hume’s own conclusions.</p>
                <p>With regard, then, to the first problem, the formal element in knowledge, Hume
                    has to consider several questions, distinct in nature and hardly discriminated
                    by him with sufficient precision. For a complete treatment of this portion of
                    the theory of knowledge, there require to be taken into consideration at least
                    the following points: (a) the exact nature and significance of the space and
                    time relations in our experience, (δ) the mode in which the primary data, facts
                    or principles, of mathematical cognition are obtained, (c) the nature, extent,
                    and certainty of such data, in themselves and with reference to the concrete
                    material of experience, <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> the principle of inference
                    from the data, however obtained. Not all of these points are discussed by Hume
                    with the same fulness, and with regard to some of them it is difficult to state
                    his conclusions. It will be of service, however, to attempt a summary of his
                    treatment under these several heads,—the more so as almost all expositions of
                    his philosophy are entirely defective in the account given of this essential
                    portion. The brief statement in the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi> § iv., is of
                    no value, and indeed is almost unintelligible unless taken in reference to the
                    full discussion contained in part ii. of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise.</hi></p>
                <p>The nature of space and time as elements in conscious experience is considered by
                    Hume in relation to a special problem, that of their supposed infinite
                    divisibility. Evidently upon his view of conscious experience, of the world of
                    imagination, such infinite divisibility must be a fiction. The ultimate elements
                    of experience must be real units, capable of being represented or imagined in
                    isolation. Whence then do these units arise? or, if we put the problem as it was
                    necessary Hume should put it to himself, in what orders or classes of
                    impressions do we find the elements of space and time? Beyond all question Hume,
                    in endeavouring to answer this problem, is brought face to face with one of the
                    difficulties inherent in his conception of conscious experience. For he has to
                    give some explanation of the nature of space and time which shall identify these
                    with impressions, and at the same time is compelled to recognize the fact that
                    they are not identical with any single impression or set of impressions. Putting
                    aside, then, the various obscurities of terminology, such as the distinction
                    between the objects known, viz., “points” or several mental states, and the
                    impressions themselves, which disguise the full significance of his conclusion,
                    we find Hume reduced to the following as his theory of space and time. Certain
                    impressions, the sensations of sight and touch, have in themselves the element
                    of space, for these impressions (Hume skilfully transfers his statement to the
                    <hi rend="italic">points')</hi> have a certain order or mode of arrangement.
                    This mode of arrangement or manner of disposition is common to coloured points
                    and tangible points, and, considered separately, is the impression from which
                    our idea of space is taken. All impressions and all ideas are received, or form
                    parts of a mental experience only when received, in a certain order, the order
                    of succession. This manner of presenting themselves is the impression from which
                    the idea of time takes its rise.</p>
                <p>It is almost superfluous to remark, first, that ∏ume here deliberately gives up
                    his fundamental principle that ideas are but the fainter copies of impressions,
                    for it can never be maintained that order of disposition is an impression, and,
                    secondly, that he fails to ofier any explanation of the mode in which <hi
                    rend="italic">coexistence</hi> and <hi rend="italic">succession</hi> are
                    possible elements of cognition in a conscious experience made up of isolated
                    presentations and representations. For the consistency of his theory, however,
                    it was indispensable that he should insist upon the real, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> presentatiV6 character of the ultimate units of space and time.</p>
                <p>How then are the primary data of mathematical cognition to be derived from an
                    experience containing space and time relations in the manner just stated? It is
                    important to notice that Hume, in regard to this problem, distinctly separates
                    geometry from algebra and arithmetic, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, he view’s
                    extensive quantity as being cognized differently from number. With regard to
                    geometry, he holds emphatically that it is an empirical doctrine, a science
                    founded on observation of concrete facts. The rough appearances of physical
                    facts, their outlines, surfaces, and so on, are the data of observation, and
                    only by a method of approximation do we gradually come near to such propositions
                    as are laid down in pure geometry. He definitely repudiates a view often
                    ascribed to him, and certainly advanced by many later empiricists, that the data
                    of geometry are hypothetical. The ideas of perfect lines, figures, and surfaces
                    have not, according to him, any existence. (See <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> i.
                    66, 69, 73,97, andiv. 180.) It is impossible to give any consistent account of
                    his doctrine regarding number. He holds, apparently, that the foundation of all
                    the science of number is the fact that each element of conscious experience is
                    presented as a unit, and adds that we are capable of considering any fact or
                    collection of facts as a unit. This <hi rend="italic">manner of conceiving</hi>
                    is absolutely general and distinct, and accordingly affords the possibility of
                    an all-comprehensive and perfect science, the science of discrete quantity, (See
                    <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> i. 97. )</p>
                <p>In respect to the third point, the nature, extent, and certainty of the
                    elementary propositions of mathematical science, Hume’s utterances are far from
                    clear. The principle with which he starts and from which follows his well known
                    distinction between relations of ideas and matters of fact, a distinction which
                    Kant appears to have thought identical with his distinction between analytical
                    and synthetical judgments, is comparatively simple. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ideas</hi> of the quantitative aspects of phenomena are exact representations
                    of these aspects or quantitative impressions; consequently, whatever is found
                    true by consideration of the ideas may be asserted regarding the real
                    impressions. No question arises regarding the <hi rend="italic">existence</hi>
                    of the fact represented by the idea, and in so far, at least, mathematical
                    judgments may be described as hypothetical. For they simply assert what will be
                    found true in any conscious experience containing coexisting impressions of
                    sense (specifically, of sight and touch), and in its nature successive. That the
                    propositions are hypothetical in this fashion does not imply any distinction
                    between the abstract truth of the ideal judgments and the imperfect
                    correspondence of concrete material with these abstract relations. Such
                    distinction is quite foreign to Hume, and can only be ascribed to him from an
                    entire misconception of his view regarding the ideas of space and time. (For an
                    example of such misconception, which is almost universal, see Biehl, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der philosophische</hi><hi rend="italic">Kriticismus,</hi> i. 96,
                    97.)</p>
                <p>From this point onwards Hume’s treatment becomes exceedingly confused. The
                    identical relation between the ideas of space and time and the impressions
                    corresponding to them apparently leads him to regard judgments of continuous and
                    discrete quantity as standing on the same footing, while the ideal character of
                    the data gives a certain colour to his inexact statements regarding the extent
                    and truth of the judgments founded on them. The emphatic utterances in fhe <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry</hi> (iv. 30, 186), and even at the beginning of the
                    relative section in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> (i. 95), may be cited in
                    illustration. But in both works these utterances are qualified in such a manner
                    as to enable us to perceive the real bearings of his doctrine, and to pronounce
                    at once that it differs widely from that commonly ascribed to him. “It is from
                    the idea of a triangle that we discover the relation of equality which its three
                    angles bear to two right ones; and this relation is invariable, so long as our
                    idea remains the same” (i. 95). If taken in isolation this passage might appear
                    sufficient justification for Kant’s view that, according to Hume, geometrical
                    judgments are analytical and therefore perfect. But it is to be recollected
                    that, according to Hume, an idea is actually a <hi rend="italic"
                    >representation</hi> or individual picture, not a notion or even a <hi
                    rend="italic">schema,</hi> and that he never claims to be able to extract the
                    predicate of a geometrical judgment by analysis of the subject. The properties
                    of this individual subject, the idea of the triangle, are, according to him,
                    discovered by observation, and as observation, whether actual or ideal, never
                    presents us with more than the rough or general appearances of geometrical
                    quantities, the relations so discovered have only approximate exactness. “Ask a
                    mathematician what he means when he pronounces two quantities to be equal, and
                    he must say that the idea of <hi rend="italic">equality</hi> is one of those
                    which cannot be defined, and that it is sufficient to place two equal qualities
                    before any one in order to suggest it. Now this is an appeal to the general
                    appearances of objects to the imagination or senses” (iv. 180). ‘ ‘ Though it
                    (i.e., geometry) much excels, both in universality and exactness, the loose
                    judgments of the senses and imagination, yet [it] never attains a perfect
                    precision and exactness” (i. 97). Any exactitude attaching to the conclusions of
                    geometrical reasoning arises from the comparative simplicity of the data for the
                    primary judgments.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0365-0354"/>
                <p>So far, then, as geometry is concerned, Hume’s opinion is perfectly definite. It
                    is an experimental or observational science, founded on primary or immediate
                    judgments (in his phraseology, <hi rend="italic">perceptions),</hi> of relation
                    between facts of intuition; its conclusions are hypothetical only in so far as
                    they do not imply the existence at the moment of corresponding real experience;
                    and its propositions have no exact truth. W ith respect to arithmetic and
                    algebra, the science of numbers, he expresses an equally definite opinion, but
                    unfortunately it is quite impossible to state in any satisfactory fashion the
                    grounds for it or even its full bearing. He nowhere explains the origin of the
                    notions of unity and number, but merely asserts that through their means we can
                    have absolutely exact arithmetical propositions <hi rend="italic">(Works,</hi>
                    i. 97, 98). Upon the nature of the reasoning by which in mathematical science we
                    pass from data to conclusions, Hume gives no explicit statement. If we were to
                    say that on his view the essential step must be the establishment of identities
                    or equivalences, we should probably be doing justice to his doctrine of
                    numerical reasoning, but should have some difficulty in showing the application
                    of the method to geometrical reasoning. For in the latter case we possess,
                    according to Hume, no standard of equivalence other than that supplied by
                    immediate observation, and consequently transition from one premise to· another
                    by way of reasoning must be, in geometrical matters, a purely verbal
                    process.</p>
                <p>Taken as a whole, the theory is perhaps the only consistent development from the
                    psychological principle with which Hume had started, and its incompleteness,
                    even incoherence, points to the gravest defects of that principle. Hume has not
                    offered even a plausible explanation of the mode by which it becomes possible
                    for a consciousness made up of isolated momentary impressions and ideas to be
                    aware of coexistence and number, or succession. The relations of ideas are
                    accepted as facts of immediate observation, as being themselves perceptions or
                    individual elements of conscious experience, and to all appearance they are
                    regarded by Hume as being in a sense analytical, because the formal criterion of
                    identity is applicable to them. It is applicable, however, not because the
                    predicate is contained in the subject, but because, such judgments of relation
                    being thought as immediate facts of conscious experience, the supposition of
                    their non-existence is a contradiction in terms. The ambiguity in his criterion,
                    however, seems entirely to have escaped Hume’s attention.</p>
                <p>A somewhat detailed consideration of Hume’s doctrine with regard to mathematical
                    science has been given for the reason that this portion of his theory has been
                    very generally overlooked or misinterpreted. It does not seem necessary to
                    endeavour to follow his minute examination of the principle of real cognition
                    with the same fulness. It will probably be sufficient to indicate the problem as
                    conceived by Hume, and the relation of the method he adopts for solving it to
                    the fundamental doctrine of his theory of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Real cognition, as Hume points out, implies transition from the present
                    impression or feeling to something connected with it. As this thing can only be
                    an impression or perception, and is not itself present, it is represented by its
                    copy or idea. Now the supreme, all-comprehensive link of connexion between
                    present feeling or impression and either past or future experience is that of
                    causation. The idea in question is, therefore, the idea of something connected
                    with the present impression as its cause or effect But this is explicitly the
                    idea of the said thing as having had or as about to have existence,—in other
                    words, belief in the existence of some matter of fact. What, for a conscious
                    experience so constituted as Hume will admit, is the precise significance of
                    such belief in real existence?</p>
                <p>Clearly the real existence of a fact is not demonstrable. For whatever is may be
                    conceived not to be. “No negation of a fact can involve a contradiction.”
                    Existence of any fact, not present as a perception, can only be proved by
                    arguments from cause or effect. But as each perception is in consciousness only
                    as a contingent fact, which might not be or might be other than it is, we must
                    admit that the mind can conceive no necessary relations or connexions among the
                    several portions of its experience.</p>
                <p>If, therefore, a present perception leads us to assert the existence of some
                    other, this can only be interpreted as meaning that in some natural, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> psychological, manner the idea of this other perception
                    is excited, and that the idea is viewed by the mind in some peculiar fashion.
                    The natural link of connexion Hume finds in the similarities presented by
                    experience. One fact or perception is discovered by experience to be uniformly
                    or generally accompanied by another, and its occurrence therefore naturally
                    excites the idea of that other. But when an idea is so roused up by a present
                    impression, and when this idea, being a consequence of memory, has in itself a
                    certain vivacity or liveliness, we regard it with a peculiar indefinable
                    feeling, and in this feeling consists the immense difference between mere
                    imagination and belief. The mind is led easily and rapidly from the present
                    impression to the ideas of impressions found by experience to be the usual
                    accompaniments of the present fact. The ease and rapidity of the mental
                    transition is the sole ground for the supposed necessity of the causal connexion
                    between portions of experience. We mistake the subjective transition resting
                    upon custom or past experience for an objective connexion independent of special
                    feelings. All reasoning about matters of fact is therefore a species of feeling,
                    and belongs to the sensitive rather than to the cogitative side of our
                    nature.</p>
                <p>While it is evident that some such conclusion must follow from the attempt to
                    regard the cognitive consciousness as made,up of disconnected feelings, it is
                    equally clear, not only that the result is self-contradictory, but that it
                    involves certain assum ptions not in any way deducible from the fundamental view
                    with which Hume starts. For in the problem of real cognition he is brought face
                    to face with the characteristic feature of knowledge, distinction of self from
                    matters known, and reference of transitory states to permanent objects or
                    relations. Deferring his criticism of the significance of self and object, Hume
                    yet makes use of both to aid his explanation of the belief attaching to reality.
                    The reference of an idea to past experience has no meaning, unless we assume an
                    identity in the object referred to. For a past impression is purely transitory,
                    and, as Hume occasionally points out, can have no connexion of fact with the
                    present consciousness. His exposition has thus a certain plausibility, which
                    λvould not belong to it had the final view of the permanent object been already
                    given.</p>
                <p>The final problem of Hume’s theory of knowledge, the discussion of the real
                    significance of the two factors of cognition, self and external things, is
                    handled in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi> with great fulness and
                    dialectical subtlety.</p>
                <p>As in the case of the previous problem, it is unnecessary to follow the steps of
                    his analysis, which are, for the most part, attempts to substitute qualities of
                    feeling for the relations of thought which appear to be involved. The results
                    follow with the utmost ease from his original postulate. If there is nothing in
                    conscious experience save what observation can disclose, while each act of
                    observation is itself an isolated feeling (an impression or idea), it is
                    manifest that a permanent identical thing can never be an object of experience.
                    Whatever permanence or identity is ascribed to an impression or idea is the
                    result of association, is one of those “propensities to feign” which are due to
                    natural connexions among ideas. We regard as successive presentations of one
                    thing the resembling feelings which are experienced in succession. Identity,
                    then, whether of self or object, there is none, and the supposition of <hi
                    rend="italic">objects,</hi> distinct from impressions, is but a further
                    consequence of our “propensity to feign.” Hume’s explanation of the belief in
                    external things by reference to association is well deserving of careful study
                    and of comparison with the more recent analysis of the same problem by J. S.
                    Mill.</p>
                <p>At the close of his presentation of the empirical theory of cognition, Hume gives
                    one of those comprehensive reviews of its significance and its difficulties
                    which mark the rare acuteness of his intellect. He has done what was possible to
                    manufacture cognition out of the isolated, disconnected states of mental
                    experience. He has endeavoured to contemplate conscious experience <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra,</hi> as itself an object of
                    experience, and to admit nothing which was not capable of being presented in the
                    fashion of an immediate fact of experience. And as the result of the whole he
                    has to confess that his laboriously constructed theory of cognition is but a
                    rope of sand, that no ingenuity can conjure coherence into elements assumed
                    from, the outset as incoherent, that the attempt to regard cognition of a fact
                    as being merely one isolated state leads to hopeless confusion. The passage in
                    which, with the utmost frankness, he expresses his opinion on the sum total of
                    his speculative analysis is so remarkable,both in reference to his own work and
                    in reference to later developments of philosophy, that it is well to quote it in
                    full. In the <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise</hi> he gives a brief <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> of what he clearly
                    recognized to be the <hi rend="italic">crux</hi> in his theory, the explanation
                    of belief, a cognition which involves the relation among themselves of the parts
                    of experience, and then goes on to say :—</p>
                <p>“If perceptions are distinct existences, they form a whole only by being
                    connected together. But no connexions among distinct existences are ever
                    discoverable by human understanding. We only <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> a
                    connexion or determination of the thought to pass from one object to another. It
                    follows, therefore, that the thought alone feels personal identity, when,
                    reflecting on the train of past perceptions that compose a mind, the ideas of
                    them are felt to be connected together and naturally introduce each other.</p>
                <p>“However extraordinary this conclusion may seem, it need not surprise us. Modern
                    philosophers seem inclined to think that personal identity <hi rend="italic"
                    >arises</hi> from consciousness, and consciousness is nothing but a reflected
                    thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore, has a promising
                    aspect. But all my hopes vanish when I come to explain the principles that unite
                    our successive perceptions in our thought or consciousness. I cannot discover
                    any theory which gives me satisfaction on this head</p>
                <p>“In short, there are two principles which I cannot render consistent, nor is it
                    in my power to renounce either of them; viz., <hi rend="italic">that all our
                    distinct perceptions are distinct existences,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that
                    the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences.</hi> Did
                    our perceptions either inhere in something simple or individual, or did the mind
                    perceive some real connexion among them, there would be no difficulty in the
                    case” (ii. p. 551).</p>

                <p>The closing sentences of this passage maybe regarded as pointing to the very
                    essence of the Kantian attempt at solution of the problem of knowledge. Hume
                    sees distinctly that if conscious experience be taken as containing only
                    isolated states, no progress in explanation of cognition is possible, and that
                    the only hope of further development is to be looked for in a radical change in
                    our mode of conceiving experience. The work of the critical philosophy is the
                    introduction of this new mode of regarding experience, a mode which, in the
                    technical language of philosophers, has received the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >transcendental</hi> as opposed to the psychological method followed by Locke
                    and Hume. It is because Kant alone perceived the full significance of the change
                    required in order to meet the difficulties of the empirical theory that we
                    regard his system as the only sequel to that of Hume. The writers of the
                    Scottish school, Reid in particular, did undoubtedly indicate some of the
                    weaknesses in Hume’s fundamental conception, and their attempts to show that the
                    isolated feeling cannot be taken as the ultimate and primary unit of cognitive
                    experience are efforts in the right direction. But the question of knowledge was
                    never generalized by them, and their reply to Hume, therefore, remains partial
                    and inadequate, while its effect is weakened by the uncritical assumption of
                    principles which is a characteristic feature of their writings.</p>
                <p>The results of Hume’s theoretical analysis are applied by him to the problems of
                    practical philosophy and. religion. For the first of these the reader is
                    referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethics,</hi> where Hume’s views are
                    placed in relation to those of his predecessors in the same field of inquiry.
                    His position, as regards the second, is very noteworthy. As before said, his
                    metaphysic contains <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">abstracto</hi>
                    the principles which were at that time being employed, uncritically, alike by
                    the deists and by their antagonists. There can be no doubt that Hume has
                    continually in mind the theological questions then current, and that he was
                    fully aware of the mode in which his analysis of knowledge might be applied to
                    them. A few of the less important of his criticisms, such as the argument on
                    miracles, became then and have since remained public property and matter of
                    general discussion. But the full significance of his work on the theological
                    side was not at the time perceived, and justice has barely been done to the
                    admirable manner in which he has reduced the theological disputes of the century
                    to their ultimate elements. The importance of the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues on
                    Natural Religion,</hi> as a contribution to the criticism of theological ideas
                    and methods, can hardly be overestimated. A brief survey of its contents will be
                    sufficient to show its general nature and its relations to such works as
                    Clarke’s <hi rend="italic">Demonstration</hi> and Butler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analogy.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> introduce three
                    interlocutors, Demea, Cleanthes, and Philo, who represent three distinct orders
                    of theological opinion. The first is the type of a certain <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> view, then regarded as the safest bulwark against infidelity, of
                    which the main tenets were that the being of God was capable of <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> proof, and that, owing to the finitude of our
                    faculties, the attributes and modes of operation of deity were absolutely
                    incomprehensible. The second is the typical deist of Locke’s school, improved as
                    regards his philosophy, and holding that the only possible proof of God’s
                    existence was <hi rend="italic">a posteriori,</hi> from design, and that such
                    proof was, on the whole, sufficient. The third is the type of completed
                    empiricism or scepticism, holding that no argument, either from reason or
                    experience, can transcend experience, and consequently that no proof of God’s
                    existence is at all possible. The views of the first and second are played off
                    against one another, and criticized by the third with great literary skill and
                    effect. Cleanthes, who maintains that the doctrine of the incomprehensibility of
                    God is hardly distinguishable from atheism, is compelled by the arguments of
                    Philo to reduce to a minimum the conclusion capable of being inferred from
                    experience as regards the existence of God. For Philo lays stress upon the
                    weakness of the analogical argument,points out that the demand for an ultimate
                    cause is no more satisfied by thought than by nature itself, shows that the
                    argument from design cannot warrant the inference of a perfect or infinite or
                    even of a single deity, and finally, carrying out his principles to the full
                    extent, maintains that, as we have no experience of the origin of the world, no
                    argument from experience can carry us to its origin, and that the apparent marks
                    of design in the structure of animals are only results from the conditions of
                    their actual existence. So far as argument from nature is concerned, a total
                    suspension of judgment is our only reasonable resource. Nor does the <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument in any of its forms fare better, for reason
                    can never demonstrate a matter of fact, and, unless we know that the world had a
                    beginning in time, we cannot insist that it must have had a cause. Demea, who is
                    willing to give up his abstract proof, brings forward the ordinary theological
                    topic, man’s consciousness of his own imperfection, misery, and dependent
                    condition. Nature is throughout corrupt and polluted, but “the present evil
                    phenomena are rectified in other regions and in some future period of
                    existence.” Such a view satisfies neither of his interlocutors. Cleanthes,
                    pointing out that from a nature thoroughly evil we can never prove the existence
                    of an infinitely powerful and benevolent Creator, nazards the conjecture that
                    the deity, though all-benevolent, is not all-powerful. Philo, however, pushing
                    his principles to their full consequences, shows that unless we assumed (or
                    knew) beforehand that the system of nature was the work of a benevolent but
                    limited deity, we certainly could not, from the facts of nature, infer the
                    benevolence of its creator. Cleanthes’s view is, therefore, an hypothesis, and
                    in no sense an inference.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> ought here to conclude. There is, however,
                    appended one of those perplexing statements of personal opinion (for Hume
                    declares Cleanthes to be his mouthpiece) not uncommon among writers of this
                    period. Cleanthes and Philo come to an agreement, in admitting a certain
                    illogical force in the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> argument, or, at
                    least, in expressing a conviction as to God’s existence, which may not perhaps
                    be altogether devoid of foundation. The precise value of such a declaration must
                    be matter of conjecture. Probably the true statement of Hume’s attitude
                    regarding the problem is the somewhat melancholy utterance with which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> close.</p>
                <p>It is apparent, even from the brief summary just given, that the importance of
                    Hume in the history of philosophy consists in the vigour and logical exactness
                    with which he develops a particular metaphysical view. Inconsistencies, no
                    doubt, are to be detected in his system, but they arise from the limitations of
                    the view itself, and not, as in the case of Locke and Berkeley, from imperfect
                    grasp of the principle, and endeavour to unite with it others radically
                    incompatible. In Hume’s theory of knowledge we have the final expression of what
                    may be called psychological individualism or atomism, while his ethics and
                    doctrine of religion are but the logical consequences of this theory. So far as
                    metaphysic is concerned, Hume has given the final word of the empirical school,
                    and all additions, whether from the specifically psychological side or from the
                    general history of human culture, are subordinate in character, and affect in no
                    way the nature of his results. It is no exaggeration to say that the more recent
                    English school of philosophy, represented by J. S. Mill, has made in theory no
                    advance beyond Hume. In the <hi rend="italic">logic</hi> of Mill, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> we find much of a special character that has no
                    counterpart in Hume, much that is introduced <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">extra,</hi> from general considerations of scientific procedure,
                    but, so far as the groundwork is concerned, the <hi rend="italic">System of
                    Logic</hi> is a mere reproduction of Hume's doctrine of knowledge. Such a
                    statement does not detract from the merits of the <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>
                    or even from its originality, for it is remarkable how slight seems to have been
                    the acquaintance of Mill with the works of his greatest predecessor, but it does
                    imply that, so far as solution of the philosophical problem is concerned, no
                    advance has been made beyond the position of Hume. The same remark, indeed, may
                    be applied to the few efforts of the later empirical writers in the region of
                    metaphysics or theology. It is impossible for any reader of Mill’s remarkable
                    posthumous essay on theism to avoid the reflexion that in substance the
                    treatment is identical with that of the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues on Natural
                    Religion,</hi> while on the whole the superiority in critical force must be
                    assigned to the earlier work. All this merely shows how fully the conclusion one
                    would naturally draw from Hume’s writings has been borne out by the history of
                    later thought. From his position, and on his lines, no further advance was
                    possible. For a new treatment of philosophical problems a thorough revision of
                    those premises, the adoption of new ground, was requisite. So far as one can
                    see, the only systems of thought which have endeavoured or are endeavouring in a
                    comprehensive fashion to take up anew the work of philosophy are, on the one
                    hand, the Kantian, with its extensive developments, and, on the other, that of
                    scientific naturalism, which latter, though weak in its metaphysic, is yet
                    penetrated with a truly philosophical spirit.</p>
                <p>The chief work for Hume’s life is that of Mr J. H. Burton, <hi rend="italic">Life
                    and Correspondence of David Hume,</hi> 2 vols.. 1846. Of his collected writings,
                    the standard edition has been till recently that of 1826 (reprinted 1854), in 4
                    vols. The best edition, containing, in addition to philosophical introductions,
                    much bibliographical matter, is that of 1874, in 4 vols.. by T. H. Green and T.
                    H. Grose. Of works upon Hume, the numerous sketches and essays being omitted,
                    the following are the most important.;—Jodi, <hi rend="italic">Leben und

                    contains the best account of Hume's theological position. Most works on the
                    Kantian philosophy contain sections specially on Hume. The treatments in the
                    general histories of philosophy cunnot be pronounced satisfactory. (R∙ AD.)</p>
