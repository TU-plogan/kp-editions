                    an adequate elementary education there, served as steward in several families of
                    position, latterly in that of the duke of Somerset, who ultimately obtained for
                    him the post of riding purveyor to the master of the horse, a sinecure worth
                    about .£200 a year. In this employment he became acquainted with Dr Woodward,
                    physician to the duke, and author of a work entitled <hi rend="italic">The

                    own collecting, along with a mass of manuscript notes, for arrangement and
                    publication. A misunderstanding as to the manner in which these should be dealt
                    with was the immediate occasion of the publication by Hutchinson in 1724 of <hi
                        rend="italic">Moses's</hi><hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> part i., in
                    which Woodward’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> was bitterly ridiculed,
                    his conduct with regard to the mineralogical specimens not obscurely
                    characterized, and a refutation of the Newtonian doctrine of gravitation
                    seriously attempted. It was followed by part ii. in 1727, and by various other
                    works published at frequent intervals. Hutchinson died in 1737. A complete
                    edition of all the publications of this author, along with his posthumous
                    pieces, edited by Robert Spearman and Julius Bate, appeared in 1748 (12 vols.);
                    an <hi rend="italic">Abstract</hi> of these followed in 1753; and a <hi
                        rend="italic">Supplement,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by Spearman
                    prefixed, in 1765.</p>
                <p>Although the crude ideas of Hutchinson at the time of their first promulgation
                    were successful, by their seeming devoutness, in commending themselves to some
                    of the pious but dim-sighted and over-timid souls of that period, who had taken
                    alarm at the atheistic conclusions they believed to be deducible from the
                    Newtonian doctrines, they are now too uninfluential, as well as too glaringly
                    inconsistent with the universally recognized principles of physics and
                    philology, to call for any detailed analysis. Their nature may be almost
                    sufficiently gathered from the titles of some of the works in which they are set
                    forth, such as <hi rend="italic">Moses's Ρriηdpiα, Parti.; of the Invisible
                        Parts of Matter, of Motion, of Visible Forms, and of their Dissolution and

                        >Part II.; of the Circulation of the Heavens; of the Cause of the Motion and
                        Course of the Earth, Moon, &lt;kc.; of the Religion, Philosophy, and Emblems
                        of the Heathens before Moses writ., and of the Jews after; in Confirmation
                        of the Natural History of the Bible; Moses's Sine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Principio,</hi><hi rend="italic">represented by Names, JVords, Types,
                        Emblems; with an introduction to show the Nature of the Fall, of Paradise,
                        and of the Body and Soul; The Confusion of Tongues and Trinity of the
                        Gentiles (being an account of the origin of Idolatry); Power Essential and
                        Mechanical, or what power belongs to God and what to his creatures, in which
                        the design of Sir I. Newton and Dr Samuel Clarke is laid open; Glory or
                        Gravity, wherein the Objects and Articles of the Christian Faith are
                        exhibited; The Religion of Satan, or Antichrist Delineated.</hi> Bishop
                    Horne of Norwich, it may be mentioned, was during some of his earlier years an
                    avowed Hutchinsonian; and Jones of Nayland continued to be so to the end of his
                    life.</p>
