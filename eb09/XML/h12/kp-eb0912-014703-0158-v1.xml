                <p><label type="entry">HOOGHLY</label>, aBritish district in the
                    lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, lying between 22° 13' 45" and 23° 13' 15" N.
                    lat., and between 87° 47' and 88° 33' E. long. The area, including the
                    magistracy of Howrah, amounted in 1878 to 1467 square miles. It forms the
                    south-eastern portion of the Bardwân division, and is bounded N. by the district
                    of Bardwân, E. by the Hooghly river, separating it from the districts of Nadiyâ
                    and the Twenty-Four Parganâs; S. by the Rùpnârâyan, separating it from Midnapur;
                    and W. by the same river, separating it from Midnapur, and by Bardwân
                    district.</p>
                <p>The district is flat, with a gradual ascent to the north and north-west. The
                    scenery along the high-lying bank of the Hooghly has a quiet beauty of its own,
                    presenting the appearance of a connected series of orchards and gardens,
                    interspersed with factories, villages, and temples. The principal rivers are the
                    Hooghly, the Dâmodar, and the Rùpnârâyan. The Dâmodar is the only large river
                    which intersects the district. As in other deltaic districts, the highest land
                    lies nearest the rivers, and the lowest levels are found midway between two
                    streams. There are in consequence considerable marshes both between the Hooghly
                    and the Damodar and between the latter river and the Rùpnârâyan.</p>
                <p>The first regular census of the district (1872) showed a population of 1,488,556
                    persons, of whom 722,856 were males and 765,700 females. Of these 813 were
                    Non-Asiatics, the great majority of them Europeans, and 557 were of mixed races
                    (Eurasians). The Hindus numbered 1,186,435; Mahometans, 299,025; and the
                    Christian community, 2583. Seven municipalities contain a population of over
                    5000 each, viz., Howrah, 97,784; Hooghly and Chinsurah given as one town,
                    34,761; Serampur, 24,448; Baidyabati, 13,332; Bansbaria, 7861; Bhadreswar, 7417;
                    and Kotrang, 6811. <hi rend="smallcaps">Howrah</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.ν.)</hi>
                    is the largest and most important town in the district. Amongst other places of
                    interest are— Tribeni, a place of great sanctity, and the scene of many
                    religious gatherings; Panduah, now a small village, but in ancient times the
                    fortified seat of a Hindu raja; Tarakeswar, a village containing a large and
                    richly endowed shrine of great holiness, visited at all times of the year by
                    crowds of pilgnms. The total revenue in 1870-71 was £239,452, and the
                    expenditure £84,989. In 1870 there were 16 magisterial and 35 civil and revenue
                    courts, with 8 covenanted English officers. The regular police force of Hooghly
                    and Howrah consisted (1871) of 1140 men, maintained at a cost of £20,726. There
                    was also in 1870 a municipal force (exclusive of Howrah) of 583 men, costing
                    £4475, and a rural police of 7068 men, costing £17,856. The number of

                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0159-0148"/> 1877-78 was 625, attended by 22,666 pupils.
                    The principal educational institution in the district is the Hooghly College,
                    attended in 1872 by 3142 students, on which the expenditure was £5143.</p>
                <p>Rice forms the staple crop of the district, occupying about thirteen-sixteenths
                    of the cultivated area; the other cereals are barley, wheat, and Indian corn.
                    The other crops consist of pease, pulses, oil-seeds, vegetables, jute, hemp,
                    cotton, sugar-cane, indigo, mulberry, tobacco, and <hi rend="italic">pan.</hi>
                    Blights occasionally visit Hooghly and Howrah, but they have not affected any
                    crop throughout the entire district. An exceptional case was that of the “Bombay
                    sugar-cane,” which was totally destroyed by blight in 1860. Droughts caused by
                    deficiency of rainfall sometimes occur, but not to any serious extent. Floods
                    are rare. The trade of the district is chiefly carried on by means of permanent
                    markets. The principal exports are—fine rice, silk, indigo, jute, cotton cloth,
                    and vegetables; the chief imports are common rice, English piece goods, lime,
                    timber, &amp;c. The chief manufactures are silk and cotton. In 1870 there were
                    400 miles of road in Hooghly district, maintained at a cost of £4000. The East
                    Indian Railway has its principal terminus at Howrah, and runs through the
                    district for about 45 miles; there are 10 stations in the district. There are
                    six canals in Hooghly district used for water-carriage, of a total length of 33
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The climate does not differ from that of Lower Bengal generally. The average
                    maximum temperature is 92° F., the minimum 68° F., and the average annual
                    rainfall about 70 inches. The diseases of the district are fever, cholera,
                    dysentery, &amp;c. An epidemic malarious fever has raged at intervals, and is
                    said to have carried off more than half the population and to have almost
                    depopulated certain villages. There are 7 hospitals and dispensaries.</p>
                <p>From an historical point of view the district possesses as much interest as any
                    in Bengal, or indeed in ludia. In the early period of the Mahometan role
                    Satgiion was the seat of the governors of Lower Bengal and a mint town. It was
                    also a place of great commercial importance. In consequence of the silting up of
                    the Saraswati, the river on which Satgâon was situated, the town became
                    inaccessible to large ships, and the Portuguese moved to Hooghly. In 1632 the
                    latter place, having been taken from the Portuguese by the Mahometans, was made
                    the royal port of Bengal; and all the public offices and records were withdrawn
                    from Satgaon, which rapidly fell into decay. In 1640 the East India Company
                    established a factory at Hooghly. This was the first English settlement in Lower
                    Bengal. In 1685, a dispute having taken place between the English factors and
                    the nawâb of Bengal, the town was bombarded and bunted to the ground. This was
                    not the first time that Hooghly had been the scene of a struggle deciding the
                    fate of a European power in India. In 1629, when held by the Portuguese, it was
                    besieged for three months and a half by a large Mahometan force sent by the
                    emperor Shah Jahan. The place was carried by storm; more than 1000 Portuguese
                    were killed, upwards of 4000 prisoners taken, and of 300 vessels only 3 escaped.
                    But Hooghly district possesses historical interest for other European nations
                    besides England and Portugal. The Dutch established themselves at Chinsurah in
                    the 17th century, and held the place till 1825, when it was ceded to Great
                    Britain in exchange for the island of Java. The Danes settled at Serampur, where
                    they remained till 1825, when all Danish possessions in India were transferred
                    to the East India Company. Chandarnagar became a French settlement in 1683. The
                    English captured this town twice, but since 1816 it has remained in the
                    possession of the French.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hooghly,</hi> the administrative headquarters of the above
                    district, is a town situated on the right or west bank of the Hooghly, 22° 54'
                    44'' N. lat. and 88° 26' 28'' E. long. Hooghly and Chinsurah form one
                    municipality, and the two towns were treated as one in the enumeration of 1872.
                    Population, 34,761, viz., 17,114 males and 17,647 females:—Hindus, 27,429;
                    Mahometans,6952; Christians, 328; “others,” 52. Hooghly is a station on the East
                    Indian Railway, 25 miles from Calcutta. The principal building is a handsome
                    “imâmbârâ,” constructed out of funds which had accumulated from an endowment
                    originally left for the purpose by a wealthy Shiâ gentleman, Muhammad Mohsin.
                    The town is said to have been founded by the Portuguese in 1537, on the decay of
                    Sâtgâon, the royal port of Bengal. Upon establishing themselves they built a
                    fort at a place called Gholghat (close to the present jail), vestiges of which
                    are still visible in the bed of the river. This fort gradually grew into the
                    town and port of Hooghly. (w. w. H.)</p>
