                    valuable branch of Chinese literature, known during the last half century,
                    chiefly through the labours of Continental scholars. It consists of the
                    narratives of Chinese Buddhists who travelled to India, whilst their religion
                    flourished there, with the view of visiting the sites consecrated by the history
                    of Sakya Muni, of studying at the great convents which then existed in India,
                    and of collecting books, reliques, and other sacred objects. In short, their
                    objects and their narratives bear a strong analogy to the objects and narratives
                    of the many pilgrimages to Palestine in the same and later ages which have come
                    down to us in ecclesiastical collections.</p>
                <p>The importance of these writings as throwing light on the geography and history
                    of India and adjoining countries, during a very dark period, is great, and they
                    have been the subject of elaborate commentaries by students in our own day, some
                    of the chief of which will be noted at the end of this article. Several Chinese
                    memoirs of this kind appear to have perished; and especially to be regretted is
                    a great collection of the works of travellers to India, religous and secular, in
                    sixty books, with forty more of maps and illustrations, published at the expense
                    of the emperor Kao-T’song of the T’ang dynasty, 666 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> with a preface from the imperial hand. We will mention the clerical
                    travellers of this description who are known to us by name.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Shi-tao-an</hi> (died 385) wrote a work on his travels to
                    the “western lands” (an expression applying often to India), which is supposed
                    to be lost. 2. <hi rend="italic">Fa-hian</hi> travelled to India in 399, and
                    returned by sea in 414. His work, called <hi rend="italic">Fo-Kwi-Ki, or Memoirs
                    on the Buddha Realms,</hi> has been translated by Abel-Rémusat and Landresse,
                    and again into English by the Rev. 8. Beale; Mr Laidlay of Calcutta also
                    published a translation from the French, with interesting notes. 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hwai Seng</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sung-Yun,</hi> monks,
                    travelled to India to collect books and reliques, 518-521. Their short narrative
                    has been translated by the late Karl Fried. Neumann, and also by Mr Beale (along
                    with Fa-hian). 4. <hi rend="italic">Hwen T’sang,</hi> the subject of this
                    notice. In relation to his travels there are two Chinese works, both of which
                    have been translated with an immense appliance of labour and learning by Μ.
                    Stanislas Julien, viz., (a) the <hi rend="italic">Ta-I"ang-Si-Yτe-Ki, or Memoirs
                    on Western Countries issued by the T’ang Dynasty,</hi> which was compiled under
                    the traveller’s own supervision, by order of the great emperor Tai-T’sung; and
                    (5) a <hi rend="italic">Biography of Hwen T’sang</hi> by two of his
                    contemporaries. 5. <hi rend="italic">The Itinerary of Fifty-six Religious
                    Travellers,</hi> compiled and published under imperial authority, 730. 6. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Itinerary of Khi-Nie,</hi> who travelled (964-976) at the head
                    of a large body of monks to collect books, &amp;c. Neither of the last two has
                    been translated.</p>
                <p>Hwen T’sang was born in the district of Ken-Shi, near Honan-Fu, about 605, a
                    period at which Buddhism appears to have had a powerful influence upon a large
                    .b°dy of educated Chinese. From childhood gravé and studious, he was taken in
                    charge by an elder brother who had adopted the monastic life, in a convent at
                    the royal city of Loyang in Honan. Hwen T’sang soon followed his brother’s
                    example. For some years he travelled over China, teaching and learning, and
                    eventually settled for a time at the capital Chang-ngan (now Si-ngan-fu in
                    Shensi), where his fame for learning became great. The desire which he
                    entertained to visit India, in order to penetrate all the doctrines of the
                    Buddhist philosophy, and to perfect the collections of Indian books which
                    existed in China, grew irresistible, and in August 629 he started upon his
                    solitary journey, eluding with difficulty the strict prohibition which was in
                    force against crossing the frontier.</p>
                <p>The “master of the law,” as his biographers call him, plunged alone into the
                    terrible desert of the Gobi, then known as the Sha-ho or “Sand River,” between
                    Kwa-chau and Igu (now Hami or Kamil). At long intervals he found help from the
                    small garrisons of the towers that dotted the desert track. Very striking is the
                    description, like that given six centuries later by Marco Polo, of the
                    quasi-supernatural horrors that beset the lonely traveller in the wilderness—the
                    visions of armies and banners; and the manner in which they are dissipated
                    singularly recalls passages in Bunyan’s <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's
                    Progress.</hi> After great suffering Hwen T’sang reached Igu, the seat of a
                    Turkish principality, and pursued his way along the southern foot of the
                    T’ien-shan, which he crossed by a glacier pass (vividly described) in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n434/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0434-0419"/> the longitude of Lake Issikul. In the valley of
                    the Talas river he encounters the great khan of the Turks on a hunting party,—a
                    rencontre which it is interesting to compare with the visit of Zefnarchus to the
                    great khan Dizabulus, sixty years before, in the same region. Passing by the
                    present Tashkend, and by Samarkand, then inhabited by fire worshippers, he
                    reached the basin of the Upper Oxus, which had recently been the seat of the
                    powerful dominion of the Haiathelah, Ephthalites, or White Huns, known in
                    earlier days to the Greeks as <hi rend="italic">Tochari,</hi> and to Hwen T’sang
                    (by the same name) as <hi rend="italic">Tuholo</hi> or Tukhära. His account of
                    the many small states into which the Tukhara empire had broken up is of great
                    interest, as many of them are identical in name and topography with the high
                    valley states and districts on the Upper Oxus, which are at this day the object
                    of so much geographical and political interest.</p>
                <p>Passing by Bamian, where he speaks of the great idols still so famous, he crosses
                    Hindu-Kush, and descends the valley of the Cabul river to Nagarahara, the site
                    of which, still known as Nagara, adjoining Jalâlâbâd, has recently been explored
                    by Mr W. Simpson. Travelling thence to Peshâwar <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Purushapurd),</hi> the capital of Gandhâra, he made a digression, through the
                    now inaccessible valley of Swat and the Dard states, to the Upper Indus,
                    returning to Peshawar, and then crossing the Indus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sintu)</hi> into the decayed kingdom of <hi rend="italic">Taxila</hi>
                    (Ta-cha-si lo, TakshasiU), then subject to Kashmir. In the latter valley he
                    spent two whole years (631-633), studying in the convents, and visiting the many
                    monuments of his faith. We cannot follow his further travels in detail, and can
                    only mention some of the chief points in his devious route. Such are Mathura <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mot</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">ulo~),</hi> whence he turned north
                    to Thânesar and the upper Jumna and Ganges, returning south down the valley of
                    the latter to Kanyâkubja or Kanauj, then one of the great capitals of India. The
                    pilgrim next entered on a circuit of the most famous sites of Buddhist and of
                    ancient Indian history, such as Ayodhyâ, Prayaga (Allahâ-bàd), Kâusâmbhi,
                    Srâvasti, Kapilavastu the birthplace of Sàkya, Kusinagara his death place,
                    Pâtalipûtra (Patna, the <hi rend="italic">Ρalibothra</hi> of the Greeks), Gayâ,
                    Râjagriha, and Nâlanda, the most famous and learned monastery and college in
                    India, adorned by the gifts of successive kings, of the splendour of which he
                    gives a vivid description, and of which traces have recently been recovered.
                    There he again spent nearly two years in mastering Sanskrit and the depths of
                    Buddhist philosophy. Again, proceeding down the banks of the Ganges, he diverged
                    eastward to Kâmarüpa (Assam), and then passed by the great port of Tâmralipti
                    (Tamlük, the misplaced <hi rend="italic">Τamalitis</hi> of Ptolemy), and through
                    Orissa to Kanchipâra (Conjeveram), about 640. Thence he went northward across
                    the Carnatic and Mahârâshtra to Barakacheva (Baréch of our day, <hi
                    rend="italic">Barygaza</hi> of the Greeks). After this he visited Malwa, Kach’h,
                    Surâshtra (peninsular Guzerat, <hi rend="italic">Syrastreηe</hi> of the Greeks),
                    Sindh, Multân, and Ghazni, whence he rejoined his former course in the basin of
                    the Cabul river.</p>
                <p>This time, however, he crosses Pamir, of which he gives a remarkable account, and
                    passes by Kashgar, Khotan <hi rend="italic">(κustana),</hi> and the vicinity of
                    Lop <hi rend="italic">{Naυapa)</hi> across the desert to Kwa-chau, whence he had
                    made his venturous and lonely plunge into the waste fifteen years before. He
                    carried with him great collections of books, precious images, and reliques, and
                    was received (April 645) with public and imperial enthusiasm. The emperor
                    Tai-T’sung desired him to commit his journey to writing, and also that he should
                    abandon the eremitic rule and serve the state. This last he declined, and
                    devoted himself to the compilation of his narrative and the translation of the
                    books he had brought with him from India. The former was completed 648 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In 664 Hwen T’sang died in a convent at Chang-ngan.
                    Some things in the history of his last days, and in the indications of beatitude
                    recorded, strongly recall the parallel history of the saints of the Roman
                    calendar. But on the other hand we find the Chinese saint, on the approach of
                    death, causing one of his disciples to frame a catalogue of his good works, of
                    the books that he had translated or caused to be transcribed, of the sacred
                    pictures executed at his cost, of the alms that he had given, of the living
                    creatures that he had ransomed from death. “When Kia-shang had ended writing
                    this list, the master ordered him to read it aloud. After hearing it the
                    devotees clasped their hands, and showered their felicitations on him.” Thus the
                    “well-done, good and faithful,” comes from the servant himself in
                    self-applause.</p>
                <p>The book of the biography, by the disciples Hwae-li and Yent’song, as rendered
                    with judicious omissions by Stan. Julien, is exceedingly interesting; its
                    Chinese style receives high praise from the translator, who says he has often
                    had to regret his inability to reproduce its grace, elegance, and vivacity. We
                    cannot here give any idea of the uses which the accounts of Hwen T’sang have
                    served in illustrating geography and history, but must refer to the appended
                    list of works.</p>
