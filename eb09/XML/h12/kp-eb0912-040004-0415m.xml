                <p><label type="entry">HUSBAND AND WIFE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Law relating
                    to</hi></label>. For the modes in which the relation of husband and wife may be
                    constituted and dissolved, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Marriage</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Divorce.</hi> The present article will deal only with the
                    effect of marriage on the legal position of the spouses. The person chiefly
                    affected is the wife, who probably in all political systems becomes subject, in
                    consequence of marriage, to some kind of disability. The most favourable system
                    scarcely leaves her as free as an unmarried woman; and the most unfavourable
                    subjects her absolutely to the authority of her husband. In modern times the
                    effect of marriage on property is perhaps the most important of its
                    consequences, and on this point the laws of different states show wide diversity
                    of principles.</p>
                <p>The history of Roman law exhibits a transition from an extreme theory to its
                    opposite. The position of the wife in the earliest Roman household was regulated
                    by the law of <hi rend="italic">Manus.</hi> She fell under the “hand” of her
                    husband,— became one of his family, along with his sons and daughters, natural
                    or adopted, and his slaves. The dominion which, so far as the children was
                    concerned, was known as the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi> was, with
                    reference to the wife, called the <hi rend="italic">manus.</hi> The subject
                    members of the family, whether wife or children, had, broadly speaking, no
                    rights of their own; all were merged in the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> of
                    the husband and father, If this institution implied the complete subjection of
                    the wife to the husband, it also implied a much closer bond of union between
                    them than we find in the later Roman law. The wife was at least a member of the
                    family, and on her husband’s death she succeeded, like the children, to freedom
                    and a share of the inheritance. <hi rend="italic">Manus,</hi> however, was not
                    essential to a legal marriage; its restraints were irksome and unpopular, and in
                    course of time it absolutely ceased to exist, leaving no equivalent protection
                    of the stability of family life. The later Roman marriage left the spouses
                    comparatively independent of each other. The bond was easily dissolved, and
                    while it lasted was loose and easy. The distance between the two modes of
                    marriage may be estimated by the fact that, while under the former the wife was
                    one of the husband’s immediate heirs, under the latter she was called to the
                    inheritance only after his kith and kin had been exhausted, and only in
                    preference to the treasury. It seems doubtful how far she had, during the
                    continuance of marriage, a legal right to enforce aliment from her husband,
                    although if he neglected her she had the unsatisfactory remedy of an easy
                    divorce. The law in fact preferred to leave the parties to arrange their mutual
                    rights and obligations by private contracts. Hence the importance of the Law of
                    Settlements <hi rend="italic">(Dotes).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Dos</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Donatio ante</hi><hi rend="italic">nuptias</hi> were
                    settlements by or on behalf of the husband or wife, during the continu ance of
                    the marriage, and the law seems to have looked with some jealousy on gifts made
                    by one to the other in any less formal way, as possibly tainted with undue
                    influence. During the marriage the husband had the administration of the
                    property,. and its destination afterwards might depend on the nature of the
                    settlement and the conduct of the parties.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> of the Roman law appears to be only one instance
                    of an institution common to all primitive societies, and suitable only to
                    society in a primitive state. On the continent of Europe after many centuries,
                    during which local usages were brought under the influence of principles derived
                    from the Roman law, a theory of marriage became established, the leading feature
                    of which is the <hi rend="italic">community of goods</hi> between husband and
                    wife. Describing the principle as it prevails in France, Story <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Conflict of Laws,</hi> § 130) says—“This community or nuptial partnership (in
                    the absence of any special contract) generally extends to all the movable
                    property of the husband and wife, and to the fruits, income, and revenue thereof
                    It extends also to all immovable property of the husband and wife acquired
                    during the marriage, but not to such immovable property as either possessedat
                    the time of the marriage, or which came to them afterwards by title of
                    succession or by gift. The property thus acquired by this nuptial partnership is
                    liable to the debts of the parties existing at the time of the marriage; to the
                    debts contracted by the husband during the community, or by the wife during the
                    community with the consent of the husband; and to debts contracted for the
                    maintenance of the family The husband aloneis entitled to administer the
                    property of the community, and he may alien, sell, or mortgage it without the
                    concurrence of the wife.” But he cannot dispose by will of more than his share
                    of the common property, nor can he part with it gratuitously <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter vivos.</hi> The community is dissolved by death (natural or civil),
                    divorce, separation of body, or separation of property. On separation of body or
                    of property the wife is entitled to the full control of her movable property,
                    but cannot alien her immovable pro<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n416/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0416-0401"/> perty without her husband’s consent, or legal
                    authority. On the death of either party the property is divided in equal moitiés
                    between the survivor and the heirs of the deceased.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Law of England.—</hi> The English common law has as usual
                    followed its own course in dealing with this subject, and in no department are
                    its rules more entirely insular and independent. The text writers all assume two
                    fundamental principles, which between them establish a system of rights totally
                    unlike that we have just described. Husband and wife are said to be one person
                    in the eye of the law— <hi rend="italic">unica</hi><hi rend="italic">persona,
                    quia caro una</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">sanguis unus.</hi>
                    Hence a man cannot grant or give anything to his wife, because she is himself,
                    and if there are any compacts between them before marriage they are dissolved by
                    the union of persons. Hence, too, the old rule of law, now greatly modified,
                    that husband and wife could not be allowed to give evidence against each other,
                    in any trial, civil or criminal. The unity, however, is one-sided only; it is
                    the wife who is merged in the husband, not the husband in the wife. And when the
                    theory does not apply, the disabilities of “coverture” suspend the active
                    exercise of the wife’s legal faculties. The old technical phraseology describes
                    husband and wife as <hi rend="italic">baron</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >femme·,</hi> the rights of the husband are baronial rights. From one point of
                    view the wife is merged in the husband, from another she is as one of his
                    vassals. A curious example is the immunity of the wife in certain cases from
                    punishment for crime committed in the presence and on the presumed coercion of
                    the husband. “So great a favourite,” says Blackstone, “is the female sex of the
                    laws of England.”</p>
                <p>The application of these principles with reference to the property of the wife,
                    and her capacity to contract, may now be briefly traced.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">freehold property</hi> of the wife becomes vested in the
                    husband and herself during the coverture, and he has the management and the
                    profits. If the wife has been in actual possession at any time during the
                    marriage of an estate of inheritance, and if there has been a child of the
                    marriage capable of inheriting, then the husband becomes entitled on his wife’s
                    death to hold the estate for his own life as tenant by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >curtesy of England (curialitas').</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Curtesy or courtesy has been explained by legal writers as
                    “arising <hi rend="italic">by favour of</hi> the law of England.” The word has
                    nothing to do with courtesy in the sense of complaisance.</p></note> Beyond
                    this, however, the husband’s rights do not extend, and the wife’s heirat last
                    succeeds to the inheritance. The wife cannot part with her real estate without
                    the concurrence of the husband; and even so she must be examined apart from her
                    husband, to ascertain whether she freely and voluntarily consents to the
                    deed.</p>
                <p>With regard to personal property, it passes absolutely at common law to the
                    husband. Specific things in the possession of the wife <hi rend="italic"
                    >(choses</hi> in possession) become the property of the husband at once; things
                    not in possession, but due and recoverable from others <hi rend="italic"
                    >(choses</hi> in action), may be recovered by the husband. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >chose</hi> in action not reduced into actual possession, when the marriage is
                    dissolved by death, reverts to the wife if she is the survivor; if the husband
                    survives, he can obtain possession by taking out letters of administration. A
                    <hi rend="italic">chose</hi> in action is to be distinguished from a specific
                    thing which, although the property of the wife, is for the time being in the
                    hands of another. In the latter case the property is in the wife, and passes at
                    once to the husband; in the former the wife has a mere <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi> ∕ws <hi rend="italic">in personam,</hi> which the husband may enforce if
                    he chooses, but which is still capable of reverting to the wife if the husband
                    dies without enforcing it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chattels real</hi> of the wife <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> personal property, dependent on, and partaking of, the nature of
                    reality, such as leaseholds) pass to the husband, subject to the wife’s right of
                    survivorship, unless barred by the husband by some act done during his life. A
                    disposition by will does not bar the wife’s interest; but any disposition <hi
                    rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> by the husband will be valid and effective.</p>
                <p>The courts of equity, however, greatly modified the rules of the common law by
                    the introduction of the wife’s <hi rend="italic">separate estate, i.e.,</hi>
                    property settled to the wife for her separate use, independently of her husband.
                    The principle seems to have been originally admitted in a case of actual
                    separation, when a fund was given for the maintenance of the wife while living
                    apart from her husband. And the conditions under which separate estate may be
                    enjoyed have taken the court of chancery many generations to develop. No
                    particular form of words is necessary to create a separate estate, and the
                    intervention of trustees, though common, is not necessary. A clear intention to
                    deprive the husband of his common law rights will be sufficient to do so. In
                    such a case a married woman is entitled to deal with her property as if she was
                    unmarried, although the earlier decisions were in favour of requiring her
                    binding engagements to be in writing or under seal. But it is now held that any
                    engagements, clearly made with reference to the separate estate, will bind that
                    estate, exactly as if the woman had been a <hi rend="italic">femme sole.</hi>
                    Connected with the doctrine of separate use is the equitable contrivance of <hi
                    rend="italic">restraint on anticipation,</hi> whereby property may be so settled
                    to the separate use of a married woman that she cannot, during coverture,
                    alienate it or anticipate the income. No such restraint is recognized in the
                    case of a man or of a <hi rend="italic">femme sole,</hi> and it depends entirely
                    on the separate estate; and the separate estate has its existence only during
                    coverture, so that a woman to whom such an estate is given may dispose of it so
                    long as she is unmarried, but becomes bound by the restraint as soon as she is
                    married. In yet another way the court of chancery interfered to protect the
                    interests of married women. When a husband sought the aid of that court to get
                    possession of his wife’s <hi rend="italic">choses</hi> in action, he was
                    required to make a provision for her and her children out of the fund sought to
                    be recovered. This is called the wife’s <hi rend="italic">equity to a
                    settlement,</hi> and is said to be based on the original maxim of chancery
                    jurisprudence, that “he who seeks equity must do equity.” Two other property
                    interests of minor importance are recognized. The wife’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >pin-money</hi> is a yearly allowance settled on het before marriage for the
                    purchase of clothes and ornaments suitable to her husband’s station, but it is
                    not an absolute gift to the separate use of the wife; and a wife surviving her
                    husband cannot claim for more than one year’s arrears of pin-money. <hi
                    rend="italic">Paraphernalia</hi> are jewels and other ornaments given to the
                    wife for the purpose of being worn by her, but not as her separate property. The
                    husband may dispose of them by act <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> but not by
                    will, unless the will confers other benefits on the wife, in which case she must
                    elect between the will and the paraphernalia.</p>
                <p>The corresponding interest of the wife in the property of the husband is much
                    more meagre and illusory. Besides a general right to maintenance at her
                    husband’s expense, she has at common law a right to <hi rend="italic"
                    >doινer</hi> in her husband’s lands, and to a <hi rend="italic">pars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rationabilis</hi> (third) of his personal estate, if he dies
                    intestate. The former, which originally was a solid provision for widows, has by
                    the ingenuity of conveyancers, as well as by positive enactment, been reduced to
                    very slender dimensions. It may be destroyed by a mere declaration to that
                    effect on the part of the husband, as well as by his conveyance of the land or
                    by his will.</p>
                <p>The common practice of regulating the rights of husband, wife, and children by
                    marriage settlements obviates the hardships of the common law—at least for the
                    women of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n417/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0417-0402"/> the wealthier classes. The legislature by the
                    Married Women’s Property Acts of 1870 and 1874 has introduced changes, the
                    benefit of which will probably be most keenly felt among the poor. The chief
                    provisions are shortly these :—(1) the earnings of a married woman in an
                    occupation carried on by her apart from her husband are to be held as property
                    settled to her separate use, independent of her husband, and her investments of
                    such earnings are similarly protected; (2) when a woman, married after the
                    passing of the Act, becomes entitled during marriage to personal property as
                    next of kin, or to any sum not exceeding £200 under a deed or will, such
                    property shall belong to her for her separate use; where real property descends
                    to her as heiress of an intestate, the rents and profits thereof shall belong to
                    her for her separate use; (3) in respect of property thus declared to be her
                    “separate estate,” she may sue in her own name; on the other hand, her husband
                    is not liable for debts contracted by her before marriage, except to the extent
                    to which he has received property in her right. Married women having separate
                    estates are made liable for the maintenance of their husbands who may become
                    chargeable to any union or parish, and of their children.</p>
                <p>A married woman cannot make any contract binding on herself except as to separate
                    estate. She can only bind her husband as his agent, but from the relation of the
                    parties the fact of agency is easily implied. The strongest case is that of a
                    wife whose husband unjustifiably refuses to maintain her; in that case she is
                    his agent, in the sense that he is bound by her contracts for <hi rend="italic"

                    her husband’s life for her separate use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Law of Scotland.—</hi> The law of Scotland on this head differs
                    less from English law than the use of a very different terminology would lead us
                    to suppose. The phrase <hi rend="italic">communio bonorum</hi> has been employed
                    to express the interest which the spouses have in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >movable</hi> property of both, but its use has been severely censured by a high
                    authority as essentially inaccurate and misleading. Mr Patrick Fraser, in his
                    elaborate and valuable treatise on <hi rend="italic">Husband and Wife,</hi>
                    contends that there is no real community of goods, and no partnership or
                    societas between the spouses. The wife’s movable property, with certain
                    exceptions, and subject to special agreements, becomes as absolutely the
                    property of the husband as it does in English law. The notion of a <hi
                    rend="italic">communio</hi> is, however, favoured by the peculiar rights of the
                    wife and children on the dissolution of the marriage. Previous to the Act 18
                    &amp; 19 Vict. c. 23 the law stood as follows. The fund formed by the movable
                    property of both spouses may be dealt with by the husband as he pleases during
                    life; it is increased by his acquisitions and diminished by his debts. The
                    respective shares contributed by husband and wife return on the dissolution of
                    the marriage to them or their representatives if the marriage be dissolved
                    within a year and a day, and without a living child. Otherwise the division is
                    into two or three shares, according as children are existing or not at the
                    dissolution of the marriage. On the death of the husband, his children take
                    one-third <hi rend="italic">(legitim),</hi> the widow takes one-third <hi
                    rend="italic">(jus</hi><hi rend="italic">relictoe),</hi> and the remaining
                    one-third (the <hi rend="italic">dead’s part)</hi> goes according to his will or
                    to his next of kin. If there be no children, the <hi rend="italic">fis
                    relictoe</hi> and the dead’s part are each one-half. If the wife die before the
                    husband, her represent ιtives, whether children or not, are creditors for the
                    value of her share. The statute above-mentioned, however, enacts that “where a
                    wife shall predecease her husband, the next of kin, executors, or other
                    representatives of such wife, whether testate or intestate, shall have no right
                    to any share of the goods in communion; nor shall any legacy or bequest, or
                    testamentary disposition thereof by such wife, affect or attach to the said
                    goods or any portion thereof.” It also abolishes the rule by which the shares
                    revert if the marriage does not subsist for a year and a day. Two later Acts
                    apply to Scotland the principlesof the English Married Women’s Property Acts.
                    These are the Act 40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. 29, which protects the earnings, &amp;c.,
                    of wives, and limits the husband’s liability for antenuptial debts of the wife,
                    and the Act 43 &amp; 44 Vict. c. 26, which enables a woman to contract for a
                    policy of assurance for her separate use.</p>
                <p>A wife’s <hi rend="italic">heritable</hi> property does not pass to the husband
                    on marriage, but he acquires a right to the administration and profits. His
                    courtesy, as in English law, is also recognized. On the other hand, a widow has
                    a <hi rend="italic">terce</hi> or liferent of a third part of the husband’s
                    heritable estate, unless she has accepted a conventional provision.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">American Law.—</hi> In the American States, the reyolt against
                    the common law theory of husband and wife has been carried further than in
                    England, and legislation tends in the direction of absolute equality between the
                    sexes. “What are familiarly known as the Married Women’s Acts,” says a recent
                    writer, “the product of American legislation during the last quarter of a
                    century, aim to secure to the wife the independent control of her own property,
                    and the right to contract, sue, and be sued without her husband, under
                    reasonable conditions” (Schouler’s <hi rend="italic">Law of Domestic
                    Relations).</hi> Each State has, however, taken its own way and selected its own
                    time for introducing modifications of the existing law, so that the legislation
                    on this subject is now exceedingly complicated and difficult. Schouler <hi
                    rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 212) gives an account of the general result in
                    the different States, from which the following is condensed: —In Maine, a
                    liberal right in married women of holding property independently of husband’s
                    control, which the wife may, however, relax by written instrument authorizing
                    her husband to manage it; in New Hampshire, the right to hold'from strangers,
                    and from her husband (not in fraud of creditors), and to keep earnings when
                    deserted; in Vermont, similar result effected by the Chancery Courts without
                    special legislation; in Massachusetts, a liberal right to acquire separate
                    property; in Rhode Island, property exempt from husband’s debts, but his control
                    recognized; in Connecticut, somewhat limited recognition of separateestate; in
                    New York, the most liberal provisions as to property held before or acquired
                    after marriage —a complete emancipation from marital dominion; a similar policy
                    in the laws of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, effected in the last case
                    by the courts rather than by statute; in Ohio, geπeιal exemption of wife’s
                    estate from her husband’s debts; in Indiana, a peculiar policy, on the community
                    system, wife’s powers of transfer limited; Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and
                    Kansas follow closely the legislation of Massachusetts; in Iowa, limited
                    recognition of wife’s estate; in California, community of goods recognized after
                    the Spanish system, formerly prevalent there,—so in Nevada; in Oregon, wife’s
                    property exempt from husband’s debts; in Nebraska, liberal rights recognized in
                    married women; in Missouri, wife’s property in land more particularly exempt
                    from husband’s debts; in Kentucky, peculiar restraint on husband’s marital
                    rights; in Tennessee, wife’s property protected, but her right to control not
                    recognized; in Arkansas a liberal policy prevails. The Southern States have been
                    later in taking up this movement, but it is considered likely that they will
                    follow the rest. The peculiar system of Homestead Laws in the Southern and
                    Western States (described in article <hi rend="smallcaps">Homestead)</hi>
                    constitutes an inalienable provision for the wife and family of the householder.
