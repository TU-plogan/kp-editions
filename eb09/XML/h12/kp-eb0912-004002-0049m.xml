                    a French general of the time of the Revolution, was born of poor parents at
                    Montreuil near Versailles, June 25, 1768. At the age of sixteen he enlisted as a
                    private soldier with the intention of proceeding to the East Indies, but was
                    sent instead to a depot of the Gardes Françaises. Having risen to the rank of
                    sergeant, he, at the outbreak of the Revolution, made an important stand with a
                    mere handful of troops against a large body of insurgents; and it was he also
                    who, at a later period, defended the entrance to the chamber of the queen when
                    her apartments were invaded by a revolutionary mob. He distinguished himself at
                    the siege of Thionville in 1792, and at the battle of Neerwinden, 13th March
                    1793. Shortly afterwards he received the brevet of general of brigade, and was
                    appointed to the command of Dunkirk, for his brilliant defence of which against
                    the duke of York he received the chief command of the army of the Moselle. The
                    purpose which he originally proposed to himself in this campaign was to cut the
                    communication between the Austrians and Prussians, and, though foiled in this
                    attempt by the superior forces of the duke of Brunswick, he succeeded by a
                    masterly manoeuvre in effecting a junction of a portion of his troops with the
                    army of the Rhine, and thus causing the Austrians to evacuate Alsace. Shortly
                    afterwards he was assigned the chief command by the representatives of the
                    people with the two armies, but, this promotion awakening the morbid suspicion
                    of Robespierre, he was recalled and thrown into prison, and it was only the
                    timely fall of Robespierre that saved him from the guillotine. On being released
                    by the convention, he was so successful in pacifying La Vendée and Brittany that
                    he was appointed to the command of the three united armies, numbering in all
                    100,000 men, in order to apply similar measures for the disarmament of the other
                    departments. After accomplishing this task with an admirable combination of
                    firmness and moderation, he was appointed to the command of an army organized
                    for the conquest of Ireland. The expedition set sail from Brest, 16th December
                    1796, but was dispersed by a storm, scarcely one half of the vessels escaping
                    shipwreck or capture. In the following year Hoche was sent to the eastern
                    frontier to act against Austria, and by a series of masterly manoeuvres he
                    succeeded in surrounding the army of General Kray, and but for a declaration of
                    peace would have taken him and all his troops prisoners of war. Not long after
                    his return he was appointed to the command of the united army in Germany,, but
                    eight days afterwards he died suddenly at Wetzlar, 18th September 1797. The
                    belief was widely spread that he had been poisoned, but the suspicion seems to
                    have been without foundation. Though Hoche at his death had not attained the age
                    of thirty, he had already displayed powers, both as politician and as
                    strategist, which, had he lived, would have rendered him a formidable rival of
                    Napoleon, and might have effectually frustrated the latter’s unscrupulous
                    ambition.</p>
