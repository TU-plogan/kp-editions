                    were assigned to it by subsequent systematic authors, whose views, not being
                    based on any infor-pιation respecting its internal structure, do not here
                    require particular attention. L’Herminier was the first to give any account of
                    its anatomy <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1837, v. p. 433), and from
                    his time our knowledge of it has been successively increased by Johannes Müller

                    Perrin <hi rend="italic">(Trans, Zool. Society,</hi> iχ. p. 353), and Garrod <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc, Zool. Society,</hi> 1879, p. 109). After a minute
                    description of the skeleton of <hi rend="italic">Opisthocomus,</hi> with the
                    especial object of determining its affinities, Prof. Huxley declared that it
                    “resembles the ordinary Gallinaceous birds and Pigeons more than it does any
                    others, and that when it diverges from them it is either <hi rend="italic">sui
                    generis</hi> or approaches the <hi rend="italic">MusophagidaeT</hi> He
                    accordingly regarded it as the type and sole member of a group, named by him <hi
                    rend="italic">Heteromorphae,</hi> which sprang from the great Carinate stem
                    later than the <hi rend="italic">Tinamomorphoe, Turnicomorphoe,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Chara-</hi><hi rend="italic">driomorphoe,</hi> but before the <hi
                    rend="italic">Peristeromorpha&gt;, Ρteroclo-</hi><hi rend="italic">morphoe,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Alectoromorphoe.</hi> This conclusion is substantially the
                    same as that at which Garrod subsequently arrived after closely examining and
                    dissecting specimens preserved in spirit; but the latter has gone further and
                    endeavoured to trace more particularly the descent of this peculiar form and
                    some others, remarking that the ancestor of <hi rend="italic">Opisthocomus</hi>
                    must have left the parent stem very shortly before the true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gallinoe</hi> first appeared, and at about the same time as the independent
                    pedigree of the <hi rend="italic">Cuculidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muso-</hi><hi rend="italic">phagidae</hi> commenced—these two groups being, he
                    believed, very closely related, and <hi rend="italic">Opisthocomus</hi> serving
                    to fill the gap between them.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible here to state at length the facts on which these views are
                    grounded, and equally impossible to give more than a very few details of the
                    anatomy of this singular form. The first thing that strikes the spectator of its
                    skeleton is the extraordinary structure of the sternal apparatus, which is
                    wholly unlike that of any other bird known. The keel is only developed on the
                    posterior part of the sternum—the fore part being, as it were, cut away, while
                    the short furcula at its symphysis meets the manubrium, with which it is firmly
                    consolidated by means of a prolonged and straight hypocleidium, and anteriorly
                    ossifies with the coracoids. This unique arrangement seems to be correlated with
                    the enormously capacious crop, which rests upon the furcula and fore part of the
                    sternum, and is also received in a cavity formed on the surface of each of the
                    great pectoral muscles. Furthermore this crop is extremely muscular, so as more
                    to resemble a gizzard, and consists of two portions divided by a partial
                    constriction, after a fashion of which no other example is known among
                    birds.</p>
                <p>The Hoactzin appears to be about the size of a small Pheasant, but is really a
                    much smaller bird. The beak is strong, curiously denticulated along the margin
                    of the maxilla near the base, and is beset by diverging bristles. The eyes,
                    placed in the middle of a patch of bare skin, are furnished with bristly lashes,
                    resembling those of Hornbills and some few other birds. The head bears a long
                    pendent crest of loose yellowish feathers. The body is olive-coloured, varied
                    with white above, and beneath is of a dull bay. The wings are short and rounded.
                    The tail is long, and tipped with yellow. The legs are long, the feet stout, the
                    tarsi reticulated, and the toes scutellated; the claws long and slightly curved.
                    According to all who have observed the habits of this bird, it lives in bands on
                    the lower trees and bushes bordering the streams and lagoons, feeding on leaves
                    and various wild fruits, especially, says Mr Bates <hi rend="italic">(Naturalist
                    on the River Amazons,</hi> i. p. 120), on those of a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Psidium,</hi> and it is also credited with eating those of an arum
                    <hi rend="italic">(Caladium</hi><hi rend="italic">arborescens),</hi> which grows
                    plentifully in its haunts. “Its voice is a harsh, grating hiss,” continues the
                    same traveller, and “it makes the noise when alarmed, all the individuals
                    sibilating as they fly heavily away from tree to tree, when disturbed by passing
                    canoes.” It exhales a very strong odour—wherefore it is known in British Guiana
                    as the “Stink-bird ”— compared by Mr Bates to “musk combined with wet hides,”
                    and by Deville to that of a cow-house. The species is said to be polygamous; the
                    nest is built on trees, of sticks <pb break="no"

                    atop. Therein the hen lays her eggs to the number of three or four, of a dull
                    yellowish-white, somewhat profusely marked with reddish blotches and spots, so
                    as to resemble those of some of the <hi rend="italic">liallidae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1867, pl. xv. fig. 7. p. 164). In the
                    valley of the Amazon it is called the <hi rend="italic">“Cigano”</hi> or Gipsy,
                    and in no part of the country where it occurs does it seem to be regarded with
                    much favour. Only one species of the genus is known to have existed, for Mr
                    Wallace’s statement <hi rend="italic">(Geogr. Distrib. Animals,</hi> i. p. 164)
                    that remains of a second have been found in Brazilian caves seems to have
                    originated in a mistake. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
