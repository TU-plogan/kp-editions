                    music and painting, extemporized marvellously on the harpsichord, and with his
                    pencil caricatured friend and foe alike with terrible facility. Incited by his
                    friend Hippel, Hoffmann on leaving school turned to the hereditary profession of
                    the law; but, as no immediate post offered itself, he gave lessons in music and
                    painting, and wrote two novels, for which he could not find a publisher. A
                    discreditable love episode with one of his pupils drove him at this time from
                    Königsberg, and he went to act as assistant to another lawyer uncle at
                    Gross-Glogau in Silesia. In 1798 he became referendary in the supreme court at
                    Berlin, and iu 1800 passed his final examination and was appointed assessor to
                    the court of Posen. Here he seems to have led a dissipated life, and to have
                    contracted the habit of excessive drinking which marred his whole career. He
                    subsequently made enemies in Posen by sending a series of scandalous caricatures
                    for distribution at a masquerade ball, and his appointment was on this account
                    changed to a councillorship at Plozk, where, having married ere this time, he
                    spent two years in retirement, studying in his leisure hours the theory of
                    music, translating Italian poetry, and sketching plans for future literary work;
                    but in 1804, again in favour at headquarters, he was transferred as councillor
                    to Warsaw. There he found a true friend in Hitzig, his colleague, and made the
                    acquaintance of Werner, at whose request he set music to some parts of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kreuz an</hi><hi rend="italic">der Ostsee.</hi> He soon became the
                    centre of musical society in Warsaw, helped to institute a concert-house or
                    “Ressource,” found leisure not only to paint its saloons but to compose music
                    for its orchestra, and was actually conducting this orchestra before
                    enthusiastic audiences when Warsaw was taken by the French in 1806. For some
                    time he lingered in Warsaw; but in the spring of 1807, having recovered from a
                    fever to find himself almost penniless, he returned to Berlin to seek some means
                    of livelihood. His only child died in Posen while he was in Berlin; and, though
                    he succeeded in obtaining the post of music-director to the Bamberg theatre, the
                    theatre soon after became bankrupt, and Hoffmann was once more destitute. He now
                    found occasional employment as a composer of operatic music, and, as a last
                    resource, attempted authorship. The editor of the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine
                    Musikalische Zeitung</hi> enlisted his services, and in that paper appeared a
                    series, afterwards published, with a preface by Jean Paul Richter, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Fantasiestücke</hi><hi rend="italic">in Callots</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Manier</hi> (1814; 4th ed., 1864). He composed at this time, among
                    other things, a <hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi> by order of the grand-duke of
                    Würzburg, and, for the proprietors of the Bamberg theatre, music to Kotzebue’s
                    opera <hi rend="italic">Das Gespenst</hi>; and he also gave lessons in music and
                    drawing, decorated saloons, and painted portraits to order. The misery of his
                    condition was enhanced by his wife’s illness and his own light-hearted
                    recklessness. The money which he inherited at the death of his uncle did not
                    suffice to pay his debts; and he had been reduced to selling his last coat for
                    food when his friends obtained for him the post of music-director to another
                    theatrical company, performing alternately at Dresden and Leipsic. Hoffmann was
                    writing romances in a garret in Dresden, or, bedridden by gout, was drawing
                    caricatures of the “verwünschte Franzosen” while Napoleon and the allied armies
                    were struggling round its walls. In 1814 appeared his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vision</hi><hi rend="italic">auf der Schlachtfelde von</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dresden;</hi> and in the same year, on the fall of Napoleon, he returned to
                    Berlin, and was reinstated in the legal profession. Two years later he was
                    appointed councillor in the supreme court, and from that time enjoyed a good
                    income, a dignified position, and the society of his best friends. He was
                    already, in virtue of his <hi rend="italic">Fantasiestücke,</hi> regarded as one
                    of the most notable romance writers of his day, but most of his works were yet
                    to come. These followed each other in quick succession. <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Elixire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Teufels</hi> appeared in 1816; <hi

                    of tales, in 1819-24; <hi rend="italic">Klein</hi><hi rend="italic">Zaches,

                    rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Katers Murr</hi> in 1821-22. He also
                    composed the opera <hi rend="italic">Undine,</hi> the libretto of which was
                    prepared by Fouqué himself. It was performed with success in Berlin; but the
                    music was lost in the subsequent destruction of the opera-house by fire.
                    Hoffmann’s prospects in Berlin were ruined by the old habit of intemperance,
                    which had grown upon him during the years of his poverty. We are told that his
                    legal duties were scrupulously performed, and that the remainder of his day was
                    spent in literary work, but that, when this was over, he avoided refined
                    society, and his nights became a series of wild pothouse revels. His health soon
                    gave way; and, after intense suffering from spinal paralysis, he died at Berlin,
                    July 24, 1822. <hi rend="italic">Der Feind,</hi> lιis last work, remained
                    unfinished.</p>
                <p>Versatility is the chief characteristic of Hoffmann’s genius, and it is also its
                    greatest weakness. He is admitted to have been an excellent jurist. His
                    paintings were clever, though fantastic. He was a popular composer and a
                    brilliant romance-writer. But this very versatility prevented his rising to
                    eminence in any one vocation; and, even as a romance-writer, in which capacity
                    he will be longest remembered, he was deficient in some of the highest
                    attributes. His imagination was unbounded, his wit light and acrid, his dialogue
                    stirring. His descriptive passages, in their minute vividness, have been
                    compared to those of Sir Walter Scott, and his romances abound in the
                    superstitious and mythical, that daemonic element which is so peculiarly German,
                    and which in Hoffmann amounted almost to a frenzy. But, with all this, a perusal
                    of his writings leaves a disagreeable impression on the mind, a feeling
                    ofdi≡satisfaction and unrest. They are the production of a misdeveloped nature,
                    of a man full of feverish impulses, oddities, and weakness, not devoid of
                    tenderness, but whose temper was unforgiving and malicious, whose prevailing
                    mood was the sarcastic, and whose only religious creed was a blind, headlong
                    fatalism. There is also a strong element in his writings which Carlyle in his
                    biography of Hoffmann has called “playerlike,” a glitter which is of tinsel, a
                    something “false, brawling, and tawdry.” His writings, like his character, are a
                    curious mixture of what is really beautiful and rare with much that is petty and
                    sordid. Their cleverness is irresistible; but the dignity of true greatness is
                    not there.</p>

                    completed work, contains in a narrative form some of his own wildest and most

                    which the third volume is wanting, is not less characteristic. Some of his
                    smaller pieces have justly been thought the most pleasing and perfect of his
                    works. Among these are <hi rend="italic">Der goldene Topf Das Fräulein von
                    Scudery, Doge und Dogaresse,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Meister Martin und seine
