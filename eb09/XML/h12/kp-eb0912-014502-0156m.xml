                    “Next to being a citizen of the world,” writes Thomas Hood in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary Reminiscences,</hi> “it must be the best thing to be born
                    a citizen of the world’s greatest city.” The best incident of his boyhood was
                    his instruction by a schoolmaster who appreciated his talents, and, as he says,
                    “made him feel it impossible not to take an interest in learning while he seemed
                    so interested in teaching.” Under the care of this “decayed dominie,” whom he
                    has so affectionately recorded, he earned a few guineas—his first literary
                    fee—by revising for the press a new edition of <hi rend="italic">Paid and
                    Virginia.</hi> Admitted soon after into the counting-house of a friend of his
                    family, he “turned his stool into a Pegasus on three legs, every foot, of
                    course, being a dactyl or a spondee but the uncongenial profession affected his
                    health, which was never strong, and he was transferred to the care of a relation
                    at Dundee. He has graphically described his unconditional rejection by this
                    inhospitable personage, and the circumstances under which he found himself in a
                    strange town without an acquaintance, with the most sympathetic nature, anxious
                    for intellectual and moral culture, but without guidance, instruction, or
                    control. This self-dependence, however, suited the originality of his character:
                    he became a large and indiscriminate reader, and before long contributed
                    humorous and poetical articles to the provincial newspapers and magazines. As a
                    proof of the seriousness with which he regarded the literary vocation, it may be
                    mentioned that he used to write out his poems in printed characters, believing
                    that that process best enabled him to understand his own peculiarities and
                    faults, and probably unconscious that Coleridge had recommended some such method
                    of criticism when he said he thought “print settles it.”</p>
                <p>His modest judgment of his own abilities, however, deterred him from literature
                    as a profession, and on his return to London he applied himself assiduously to
                    the art of engraving, in which he acquired a skill that in after years became à
                    most valuable assistant to his literary labours, and enabled him to illustrate
                    his various humours and fancies by a profusion of quaint devices, which not only
                    repeated to the eye the impressions of the text, but, by suggesting amusing
                    analogies and contrasts, added considerably to the sense and effect of the
                    work.</p>
                <p>In 1821 Mr John Scott, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine,</hi>
                    was killed in a duel, and that periodical passed into the hands of some friends
                    of Hood, who proposed to him to take a part in its publication. His installation
                    into this congenial postât once introduced him to the best literary society of
                    the time; and in becoming the associate of such men as Charles Lamb, Cary, De
                    Quincey, Allan Cunningham, Proctor, Talfourd, Hartley Coleridge, the
                    peasant-poet Clare, and other contributors to that remarkable miscellany, he
                    gradually developed bis own intellectual powers, and enjoyed that happy
                    intercourse with superior minds for which his cordial and genial character was
                    so well adapted, and which he has described in his best manner in several
                    chapters of <hi rend="italic">Hood’s Own. Odes and Addresses</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> his first work—were written about this time, in conjunction
                    with his brother-in-law Mr J. H. Reynolds, the friend of Keats; and it is
                    agreeable to find Sir Walter Scott acknowledging the gift of the work with no
                    formal expressions of gratification, but “wishing the unknown author good
                    health, good fortune, and whatever other good tilings can best support and
                    encourage his lively vein of inoffensive and humorous satire.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >JKhims and Oddities, National Tales, Tylney Hall,</hi> a novel, and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies</hi> followed. In these works
                    the humorous faculty not only predominated, but expressed itself with a
                    freshness, originality, and power which the poetical element could not claim.
                    There was much true poetry in the verse, and much sound sense and keen
                    observation in the prose of these works; but the poetical feeling and lyrical
                    facility of the one, and the more solid qualities of the other, seemed best
                    employed when they were subservient to his rapid wit, and to the ingenious
                    coruscations of his fancy. This impression was confirmed by the series of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Comic Annual,</hi> a kind of publication at that time popular,
                    which Hood undertook and continued, almost unassisted, for several years. Under
                    that somewhat frivolous title he treated all the leading events of the day in a
                    fine spirit of caricature, entirely free from grossness and vulgarity, without a
                    trait of personal malice, and with an under-current of true sympathy and honest
                    purpose that will preserve these papers, like the sketches of Hogarth, long
                    after the events and manners they illustrate have passed from the minds of men.
                    But just as the agreeable jester rose into the earnest satirist, one of the most
                    striking peculiarities of his style became a more manifest defect. The attention
                    of the reader was distracted, and his good taste annoyed, by the incessant play
                    upon words, of which Hood had written in his own vindication—</p>
                <p>“However critics may take offence, A double meaning has double sense.”</p>
                <p>Now it is true that the critic must be unconscious of some of the subtlest charms
                    and nicest delicacies of language who would exclude from humorous writing all
                    those impressions and surprises which depend on the use of the diverse sense of
                    words. The history, indeed, of many a word lies hid in its equivocal uses; and
                    it in no way derogates from the dignity of the highest poetry to gain strength
                    and variety from the ingenious application of the same sounds to different
                    senses, any more than from the contrivances of rhythm or the accompaniment of
                    imitative sounds. But when this habit becomes the characteristic of any wit, it
                    is impossible to prevent it from degenerating into occasional buffoonery, and
                    from supplying a cheap and ready resource, whenever the true vein of humour
                    becomes thin or rare. Artists have been known to have used the left hand in the
                    hope of checking the fatal facility which practice had conferred on the right;
                    and if Hood had been able to place under some restraint the curious and complex
                    machinery of words and syllables which his fancy was incessantly producing, his
                    style would have been a great gainer, and much real earnestness of object, which
                    now lie» confused by the brilliant kaleidoscope of language, would have remained
                    definite and clear. He was probably not unconscious of this danger; for, as he
                    gained experience as a writer, his diction became more simple, and his ludicrous
                    illustrations less frequent. In another annual called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gem</hi> appeared the poem on the story of “Eugene Aram,” which first
                    manifested the full extent of that poetical vigour which seemed to advance just
                    in proportion as his physical health declined. He started a magazine in his own
                    name, for which he secured the assistance of many literary men of reputation and
                    authority, but which was mainly sustained by his own intellectual activity. From
                    a sick-bed, from which he never rose, he conducted this work with surprising,
                    energy, and there composed those poems, too few in number, but immortal in the
                    English language, such as the “Song of the Shirt,” the “Bridge of Sighs,” and
                    the “Song of the Labourer,” which seized the deep human interests of the time,
                    and transported them from the ground of social philosophy into the loftier
                    domain of the imagination. They are no clamorous expressions of anger at the
                    discrepancies <pb break="no"

                    pictures of conditions of life, which neither the politician nor the moralist
                    can deny to exist, and which they are imperatively called upon to remedy. Woman,
                    in her wasted life, in her hurried death, here stands appealing to the society
                    that degrades her, with a combination of eloquence and poetry, of forms of art
                    at once instantaneous and permanent, and with a metrical energy and variety of
                    which perhaps our language alone is capable. Prolonged illness brought on
                    straitened circumstances; and application was made to Sir Robert Peel to place
                    Hood’s name on the pension list with which the British state so moderately
                    rewards the national services of literary men. This was done readily and without
                    delay, and the pension was continued to his wife and family after his death,
                    which occurred on the 3d of May 1845. Nine years after, a monument, raised by
                    public subscription, in the cemetery of Kensal Green, was inaugurated by Mr
                    Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton) with a concourse of spectators that showed how
                    well the memory of the poet stood the test of time. Artisans came from a great
                    distance to view and honour the image of the popular writer whose best efforts
                    had been dedicated to the cause and the sufferings of the workers of the world;
                    and literary men of all opinions gathered round the grave of one of their
                    brethren whose writings were at once the delight of every boy and the
                    instruction of every man who read them. Happy the humorist whose works and life
                    are an illustration of the great moral truth that the sense of humour is the
                    just balance of all the faculties of man, the best security against the pride of
                    knowledge and the conceits of the imagination, the strongest inducement to
                    submit with a wise and pious patience to the vicissitudes of human existence.
                    This was the lesson that Thomas Hood left behind him, and which his countrymen
                    will not easily forget. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h.)</hi></p>
