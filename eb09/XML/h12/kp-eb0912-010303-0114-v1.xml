                    lord chief-justice of the Court of King’s Bench in the reigns of William III.
                    and Anne, was born at Thame, Oxfordshire, December 30,1642. His father, Sir
                    Thomas Holt, possessed a small patrimonial estate, but in order to supplement
                    his income had adopted the profession of law, in which he was not very
                    successful, although he became sergeant in 1677, and afterwards for his
                    political services to the “Tories’’was rewarded with knighthood. After attending
                    for some years the free school of the town of Abingdon, of which his father was
                    recorder, young Holt in his sixteenth year entered Oriel College, Oxford. He is
                    said to have spent a very dissipated youth, and even to have been in the habit
                    of taking purses on the highway, but after entering Gray’s Inn about 1660 he
                    completely renounced his old habits and applied himself with exemplary diligence
                    to the study of law. He was called to the bar in 1663, and, although his youth
                    hindered his immediate success, when once he had an opportunity of manifesting
                    his talent he speedily acquired a lucrative practice. An ardent supporter of
                    civil and religious liberty, he distinguished himself in the state trials which
                    were then so common by the able and courageous manner in which he -supported the
                    pleas of the defendants. In February 1666 he was appointed recorder of London,
                    and on the 22d of April he was made king’s sergeant and received the honour of
                    knighthood. His giving a decision adverse to the pretensions of the king to
                    exercise martial law in time of peace led to his dismissal from the office of
                    recorder, but he was continued in the office of king’s sergeant in order <pb

                    accused persons. Having been one of the judges who acted as assessors to the
                    peers in the Convention parliament, he took a leading part in arranging the
                    constitutional change by which William III. was called to the throne, and after
                    his accession he was appointed lord chief-justice of the king’s bench. His
                    merits as a judge are the more apparent and the more remarkable when contrasted
                    with the qualities displayed by his unworthy predecessors in office. In judicial
                    fairness, legal knowledge and ability, clearness of statement, and unbending
                    integrity he has had few if any superiors on the English bench. Over the civil
                    rights of his countrymen he exercised a jealous watchfulness, more especially
                    when presiding at the trial of state prosecutions, and he was especially careful
                    that all accused persons should be treated with fairness and respect. He is,
                    however, best known for the firmness with which he upheld his own prerogatives
                    in opposition to the authority of the Houses of Parliament. On several occasions
                    his physical as well as his moral courage was tried by extreme tests. Having
                    been requested to supply a number of police to help the soldiery in quelling a
                    riot, he assured the messenger that if any of the people were shot he would have
                    the soldiers hanged, and proceeding himself to the scene of riot he was
                    successful in preventing bloodshed. A still more signal proof of his courage is
                    said to have been given in the Aylesbury case. He declared in favour of the
                    Aylesbury burgesses, who had been committed to Newgate for complaining about the
                    n on-registry of their votes. On this account his commitment was moved by the
                    Tories, but the result of the motion is uncertain. There is a tradition,
                    however, which whether true or not is equally a tribute to his integrity, that
                    the House of Commons summoned him to appear before them, and that when, on his
                    disregarding the summons, the speaker himself made his appearance, Holt told him
                    that unless he returned to his chair within five minutes he would have him sent
                    to Newgate. While steadfast in his sympathies with the Whig party, Holt
                    maintained on the bench entire political impartiality, and always held himself
                    aloof from political intrigue. On the retirement of Somers from the
                    chancellorship in 1700 he was offered the great seal, but declined it. His death
                    took place 3d March 1710, and he was buried in the chancel of Redgrave church,
                    where a fine monument in white marble was erected by his brother to his
                    memory.</p>
