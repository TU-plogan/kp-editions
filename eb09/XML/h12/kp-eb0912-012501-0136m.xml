                    meaning communion, intercourse, and especially interchange of thought and
                    feeling by means of words (conversation), was early employed in classical Greek
                    to denote the instruction which a philosopher gave to his pupils in familiar
                    talk (Xen., <hi rend="italic">Mem.,</hi> I. ii. 6, 15). This usage of the word
                    was long preserved (Aelian, <hi rend="italic">V. H.,</hi> iii. 19); and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ομιλήσας</hi> of Acts xx. 11 may safely be taken to assign not
                    only a free and informal but also a didactic character to the apostle Paul’s
                    discourse in the upper chamber at Troas, when “he talked a long while, even till
                    break of day.” That the “talk” on that occasion partook of the nature of the
                    “exposition” (∏⅞'T7) of Scripture, which, undertaken by a priest, elder, or
                    other competent person, had become a regular part of the service of the Jewish
                    synagogue,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Philo,

                    630).</p></note> may also with much probability be assumed. The custom of
                    delivering expositions or comments more or less extemporaneous on the lessons of
                    the day at all events passed over soon and readily into the Christian Church, as
                    may be gathered from the first <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> (c. 67) of Justin
                    Martyr, where we read that, in connexion with the practice of reading portions
                    from the collected writings of the prophets and from the memoirs of the
                    apostles, it had by that time become usual for the presiding minister to deliver
                    a discourse in which “he admonishes the people, stirring them up to an imitation
                    of the good works which have been brought before their notice.” This discourse,
                    from its explanatory character, and from the easy conversational manner of its
                    delivery, was for a long time called όμιλια rather than λo'γoς; it was regarded
                    as part of the regular duty of the bishop, but he could devolve it, if he though
                    fit, on a presbyter, or deacon, or even on a layman. An early and well-known
                    instance of such delegation is that mentioned by Eusebius (∕∕. <hi rend="italic"
                    >E.,</hi> vi. 19) in the case of Origen (216 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sozomen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Η. E.</hi> vii. 19) mentions that in Alexandria in his day the
                    bishop alone was in the custom of preaching; but this, he implies, was a very
                    exceptional state of matters, dating only from the time of Arius.</p></note> In
                    course of time the exposition of the lesson for the day came more frequently to
                    assume a more elaborate character, and to pass into the category of a λόγον or
                    even φιλοσοφία or <hi rend="italic">φιλοσόφημα</hi>; but when it did so the fact
                    was as far as possible denoted by a change of name, the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >ομιλία</hi> being reserved for the expository or exegetical lecture as
                    distinguished from the pulpit oration or sermon.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To the more strictly exegetical lectures the
                    names <hi rend="italic">iξ∙ηγhσeιs,</hi> «ξηγήματα, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ΐξηγητικά,</hi><hi rend="italic">iκθiσeιs,</hi> were sometimes applied. But as
                    no popular discourse delivered from the pulpit could ever be exclusively
                    expository and as on the other hand every sermon professing to be based on
                    Scripture required to be more or less “exegetical” and “textual,” it would
                    obviously be sometimes very hard to draw the line of distinction between όμιλία
                    and <hi rend="italic">λoγos.</hi> It would be difficult to define very precisely
                    the difference in French between a “conference” and a “sermon and the same
                    difficulty seems to have been experienced in Greek by Photius, who says of the
                    eloquent pulpit orations of Chrysostom, that they were όμιλίαι rather than <hi
                    rend="italic">λόγοι.</hi></p></note> While the church of the 3d and 4th
                    centuries could point to a brilliant succession of great preachers, whose
                    discourses were wont to be taken down in short hand and circulated among the
                    Christian public as edifying reading, it does not appear that the supply of
                    ordinary homiletical talent kept pace with the rapidity of her extension
                    throughout the Roman empire. In the smaller and remoter communities it not
                    uncommonly happened that the minister was totally unqualified to undertake the
                    work of preaching; and though, as is curiously shown by the case of Rome
                    (Sozom., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vii. 19), the regular exposition of the
                    appointed lessons was by no means regarded as part of the necessary business of
                    a church, it was generally felt to be advisable that some provision should be
                    made for the public instruction of congregations. Even in Jerome’s time <hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">De Kir. III.,</hi> c. 115), accordingly,
                    it had become usual to read, in the regular meetings of the churches which were
                    not so fortunate as to possess a competent preacher, the written discourses of
                    celebrated fathers; and at a considerably later period we have on record the
                    canon of at least one provincial council (that of Vaux, probably the third, held
                    in 529 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> positively enjoining that if the
                    presbyter through any infirmity is unable himself to preach, “homilies of the
                    holy fathers” (homiliae sanctorum patrum) are to be read by the deacons. Thus
                    the finally fixed meaning of the word homily as an ecclesiastical term came to
                    be a written discourse (generally possessing the sanction of some great name)
                    read in church by or for the officiating clergyman when from any cause he was
                    unable to deliver a sermon of his own. As the standard of clerical education
                    sank during the dark ages, the habit of using the sermons of others became
                    almost universal. Among the authors whose works were found specially serviceable
                    in this way may be mentioned the Venerable Bede, who is credited with no fewer
                    than 140 homilies in the Basel and Cologne editions of his works, and who
                    certainly was the author of many <hi rend="italic">Homiliae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Tempore</hi> which were much in vogue during the 8th and
                    following centuries. Prior to Charlemagne it is probable that several other
                    collections of homilies had obtained considerable popularity, but in the time of
                    that emperor these had suffered so many mutilations and corruptions that an
                    authoritative revision was felt to be imperatively necessary. The result was the
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">Homiliarium,</hi> prepared by Paul Warnefrid,
                    otherwise known as Paulus Diaconus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    probably was completed before the year 780. Though written in Latin, its
                    discourses were doubtless intended to be delivered in the vulgar tongue; the
                    clergy, however, were often too indolent or too ignorant for this, although by
                    more than one provincial council they were enjoined to exert themselves so that
                    they might be able to do so.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to be the translation of the homilies approved by the church into the

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Books of Homilies</hi> referred to in the 35th Article of
                    the Church of England originated at a convocation in 1542, at which it was
                    agreed “to make certain homilies for stay of such errors as were then by
                    ignorant preachers sparkled among the people.” Certain homilies accordingly,
                    composed by dignitaries of the lower house, were in the following year produced
                    by the prolocutor; and after some delay a volume was published in 1547 entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Certain sermons or homilies appointed by the King’s Majesty to

                    submitted along with the 39 Articles to convocation; it was issued the same year

                    1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th) are probably to be attributed to Cranmer, and one (the
                    12th) possibly to Latimer; one (the 6th) is by Bonner; another (the 2d) is by
                    Harpsfield, archdeacon of London, and a third (the 11 th) by Becon, one of
                    Cranmer’s chaplains. The authorship of the 8th and 10th is quite unknown; and
                    Becon and Ridley have been only doubtfully conjectured as the authors of the 7th
                    and 9th respectively. The second book consists of twenty-two homilies, of which
                    the 1st, 2d, 3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 17th have been assigned to Jewel, the
