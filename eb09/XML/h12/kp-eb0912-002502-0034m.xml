                    outposts about 1200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> extended as far to the west
                    as the Aegean sea. In the Egyptian inscriptions they are called the Khita or
                    Kheta; in the Assyrian, the Khatti; in the Hebrew Scriptures, the Khittirn. Some
                    confusion has been caused in the treatment of the history of the Hittites by the
                    uncritical use of the Old Testament. It is true that the Khittirn or Hittites
                    are repeatedly mentioned among the tribes which inhabited Canaan before the
                    Israelites (Gen. xv. 20; Ex. iii. 8, 17, xiii. 5, xxiii. 23, 28, xxxiii. 2,
                    xxxiv. 11; Num. xiii. 29; Deut. vii. 1, xx. 17; Josh. iii. 10, ix. 1, xi. 3,
                    xii.</p>
                <p>8, xxiv. 11; Judg. iii. 5; 1 Kings ix. 20; 2 Chr. viii. 7; Ezra ix. 1; Neh. ix.
                    8), but the lists of these pre-Israelitish populations cannot be taken as
                    strictly historical documents. Not to dwell on the cases of the Perizzites
                    (properly speaking, an appellative and not an ethnic name), and the Kenites and
                    other Arab races, sometimes included, but evidently by an anachronism (see vol.
                    iv. p. 763), it is obvious that narratives written, or (as all will agree)
                    edited, so long after the events referred to cannot be taken as of equal
                    authority with Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions. How meagre the tradition
                    respecting the Hittites was in the time of the great Elohistic narrator is shown
                    by the picture of Hittite life in Gen. xxiii. As Ewald remarks, “Abraham’s
                    allies in war are Amorites; but when he desires to obtain a possession peaceably
                    he turns to the Hittites.” Yet the undoubtedly authentic inscriptions of Egypt
                    and Assyria reveal the Hittites in far different guise, as pre-eminently a
                    warlike, conquering race. Not less unfavourable to the accuracy of the Old
                    Testament references to the Hittites is the evidence deducible from proper
                    names. As we shall see presently, the Hittite names preserved in Egyptian and
                    Assyrian records are on the whole strikingly un-Semitic. The three Hittite names
                    given in the Old Testament (Ephron, Gen. xxiii. 8, 10; Ahimelech, 1 Sam. xxvi.
                    6; Uriah, 2 Sam. xi. 3, xxiii. 39) are, however, of undeniably Semitic origin.
                    Is it unnatural to infer that these three names are no less fictitious than the
                    Semitic names ascribed in the Old Testament to the non-Semitic Philistines? It
                    is not surprising that at least two eminent Egyptologists (Chabas, Ebers) should
                    absolutely deny the identity of the Khita and the Khittirn. This, however, seems
                    to be going too far. The Old Testament writers clearly meant by the latter name
                    the same people as the Egyptian inscriptions by the former, but in their time
                    the memory of the Khita had grown so dim that they could include it among other
                    shadowy names of conquered Canaanitish peoples. No impartial scholar, indeed,
                    will deny that a branch of the Khita may once have existed in Palestine.
                    Unfortunately there is no historical evidence that it did so. In fact, the most
                    trustworthy notices in the Old Testament itself point to the Hittites as a
                    nation beyond the borders of the land of Israel. In 2 Kings vii. 6 we find “the
                    kings of the Hittites” mentioned side by side with “the kings of the Egyptians;”
                    in 1 Kings x. 29 the same phrase occurs parallel with “the kings of Aram ”; and
                    in 2 Sam. xxiv. 6 we should probably read, “and they came to Gilead, and to the
                    land of the Hittites unto Kadesh.” The position of Heth in the table of nations
                    (Gen. x. 15) may also be regarded as a vestige of an accurate geographical
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>If then we continue to employ the familiar name Hittites instead of the Egyptian
                    Khita and the Assyrian Khatti, let it be understood that by this term we do not
                    indicate one of the Canaanitish peoples conquered by the Israelites, but an
                    extra-Palestinian race capable of holding its own even against Egypt and
                    Assyria. Its centre lay, as we have seen already, and as is admitted on all
                    hands, between the Euphrates and the Orontes. This was in fact the region
                    which—one fears to say for how many centuries— was designated in the Assyrian
                    inscriptions <hi rend="italic">mat Khatti</hi> or Khatti-land. Under the name of
                    Khatti we already meet with the Hittites in the astronomical work in seventy
                    tablets drawn up by Sargina, king of Agane, in the 16th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It appears from this venerable document that
                    hostilities were constantly arising between Babylonia on the one hand and the
                    Hittite country on the other (Sayce’s translation of the tablets, <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of Soc. of</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"

                    245). Among the Assyrian kings it is Tiglath Pileser I. who makes the first
                    mention of the Khatti; in his time they are already the lords paramount of the
                    region between the Euphrates and Lebanon. Sargon, the most enterprising of the
                    Assyrian monarchs, was impatient of such an obstacle to his victorious arms. By
                    the conquest of Carchemish and Kummuch, Khatti-land lost its two great bulwarks
                    on the east, and was open henceforth to the Assyrian hosts. The last reference
                    to the Khatti is in the time of Esar-haddon, who speaks of “twenty-two kings of
                    the land of Khatti, which is by the sea and in the midst of the sea.” But it has
                    been shown by Schrader that from the time of Sennacherib onwards the name Khatti
                    was transferred to the western maritime lands in general, viz., Canaan and
                    Philistia, including Edom, Moab, and Ammon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Keilinschriftenund</hi><hi rend="italic">Geschichtsforschung,</hi> pp.
                    234-5).</p>
                <p>Turning now to the hieroglyphic monuments, we find the Khita playing a still more
                    important part in the history of Egypt,—first of all, under Thothmes III. One of
                    his generals has left us an account of his personal experiences in the campaign
                    against the Khita (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">History of Egypt,</hi> i. 354),
                    and in the Statistical Tablet of Karnak we have a record of the tribute brought
                    from “the great land of the [Khita]” <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> p. 334,
                    comp. <hi rend="italic">Records of the Past,</hi> ii. 25). At this period,
                    however, the Khita were but one among a number of peoples; in the wars of Seti
                    I. and (especially) Ramses II., they occupy the first rank among the adversaries
                    of Egypt. The account of the battle of Kadesh (the island city on the Orontes),
                    given by the Theban poet Pentaur, presents a vivid picture of the military
                    prowess of this rising power (comp. Brugsch’s translation with that of
                    Lushington. in <hi rend="italic">Records of the Past,</hi> ii. 65-78). Ramses
                    was indeed victorious, but he owed his life and consequently his victory to his
                    personal bravery, and, as Pentaur represents it, to his childlike faith in his
                    god. On an outer wall of the temple of Karnak the treaty of peace between Egypt
                    and Khita-land may still be read (comp. Brugsch’s translation with that of
                    Goodwin in <hi rend="italic">Records of the Past,</hi> iv. 25-32), and the same
                    fruitful source of primitive history has furnished inscriptions of Ramses, with
                    the names of conquered towns of the Khita, corresponding with those already
                    recorded by Thothmes III. Thus the long feud between Egypt and Khita was closed,
                    and the happy result was celebrated by the marriage of the Pharaoh to a daughter
                    of the king of his chivalrous antagonists. The name of the Khita almost
                    disappears henceforth from Egyptian history. M. Lenormant indeed <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ancient History of the East,</hi> i. 268) mentions them as
                    assailing Ramses III., but Dr Birch <hi rend="italic">(Egypt,</hi> p. 139) and
                    Brugsch Bey more accurately describe the war referred to as one between Ramses
                    and the conquerors of the Khita, viz., the confederated “Carian-Colchian
                    nations” (see Brugsch Bey, <hi rend="italic">History of Egypt,</hi> ii.
                    147).</p>
                <p>We have spoken of the Hittites as we know them from the monuments, as a people of
                    Syria. But the extra-monumental history of the Hittites, which is only beginning
                    to be divined from scattered indications, shows that their power was not limited
                    to the area between the Euphrates and the Orontes. Not only had they their
                    confederates or vassals in their near or more distant neighbourhood, but they
                    also (as it seems) despatched conquering hosts into the far-off regions of Asia
                    Minor. Even the Egyptian records have been thought to indicate this fact. At
                    that great battle of Kadesh on the Orontes to which we have already referred,
                    there were present, besides the princes of Khita, the kings of Ara th u,
                    Khilibu, Naharain, Qazanadana, Malunna, Pidasa, Leka, the Dardani or Dandani,
                    the Masu, Kerkesh or Keshkesh, Kairkamasha (so Lushington; Brugsch, somewhat
                    arbitrarily perhaps, Quirqimosh), Aherith, Anangas, Mushanath,—a mighty host
                    “gathered” (as the poet Pentaur tells us) “from the margin of the sea to the
                    land of Khita.” The late M. de Rongé, a coryphaeus in Egyptology, actually
                    supposed that this list included the Dardani of Asia Minor, the. Mysians, Ilion,
                    and perhaps the Lycians; Brugsch Bey, however, who is now a greater authority,
                    is satisfied to identify the Dardani with those of Kurdistan (comp. Herod., i.
                    189), the Leka with the Ligyes (comp. Herod., vii. 7 2), and the Masu with the
                    people of Mount Masius. But putting M. de Rougé’s opinion aside, it seems to be
                    evident from other sources that the influence of the Khita extended even into
                    Asia Minor. Prof. E. Curtius has already pointed out “that one of the paths by
                    which the art and civilization of Babylonia and Assyria made its way to Greece
                    was along the great high road which runs across Asia Minor,” and Professor Tiele
                    has been struck by the presence in the religions of Asia Minor of an unexplained
                    element which with all reserve he conjectures may be Hittite. Professor Sayce
                    has added an important contribution to the question by showing that the Hittite
                    capital Carchemish (rightly identified by Mr George Smith with the modern
                    Jerablûs) was the source from which that modified type of Assyrian art was
                    derived, which specially characterizes the early monuments of Asia Minor. “The
                    sculpture accompanied by inscriptions in Hittite (or Hamathite) characters which
                    Mr Davis discovered at Ibreez in Lycaonia <hi rend="italic">(Transactions of
                    Soc. of Bibl. Archaeology,</hi> iv. 2) proves that the Hittites had penetrated
                    through the eastern barrier of Asia Minor formed by the Taurus range; and the
                    two or three characters that still remain in the rock-cut inscription engraved
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Life in Asiatic Turkey</hi> (p. 222), and found near
                    Bulgar Maden, make it clear that Hittite power had once extended at least as far
                    as the central plateau of Asia Minor.” Evidence has now been supplied of the
                    extension of Hittite power to the very shores of the Aegean in the occurrence of
                    Hittite hieroglyphics (the same which occur at Jerablûs or Carchemish) on the
                    pseudo-Sesostris (a fellow to which has, however, been pointed out) at Ninfi,
                    the ancient Nymphaeum, on the road from Smyrna to Sardes (Letter of Professor
                    Sayce, in <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> Aug. 16, 1879). In a subsequent
                    letter, Professor Sayce remarks that there were two roads open to the Hittites,
                    and both, to judge by the scattered monuments already found, appear to have been
                    travelled by their armies. The one was that taken by Croesus on his march
                    against Cyrus; its course was through Pessinus, Ancyra, and Pterium. The other
                    was that traversed by Xenophon and the Ten Thousand; this road passed through
                    the Cilician Gates by Iconium. Both roads met in Sardes.</p>
                <p>Was this enterprising race a member of the Semitic family? Let us consider—</p>
                <p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">The evidence supplied by the pictorial representations on
                    the ancient monuments.—</hi> “If it is allowable to form a judgment on the
                    origin of this cultivated and powerful people from its outward bearing and
                    appearance, it seems to us, under the guidance of the monuments, to be at least
                    very doubtful whether we should reckon this chivalrous race among the
                    Canaanites” (who, see art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Canaanites,</hi> were probably
                    in the main Semitic). ‘ * Beardless, armed in a different manner, fighting three
                    men on each chariot of war [the Egyptian chariots only carry two], arranged in
                    their order of battle according to a well considered plan previously laid down,
                    the Khita present a striking contrast to their Canaanite allies.” Such is the
                    verdict of Brugsch and of all who have seen the wonderful Avail-sculptures in
                    the great temple of Abusimbel. No modern artist is more careful to represent
                    distinctive racial features than this primitive sculptor. Even at such a
                    distance from this national centre as Ninfi (see above), Professor Sayce
                    maintains that no one who has once seen a Hittite figure can mistake the
                    resemblance. The peaked tiara and the turned-up shoes are the peculiar marks of
                    the Hittite, and of the Hittite alone.</p>
                <p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">The evidence from language.—</hi> Our knowledge of the
                    Hittite language is confined to the proper names mentioned in the Egyptian and
                    Assyrian inscriptions—those which occur in the Hebrew Bible being, as we have
                    seen, of insufficient authority. Opinions differ as to the character of the
                    names derived from hieroglyphic sources. Id. de Bougé was strongly convinced of
                    their Semitic origin, but his explanations<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0036-0027"/> are for the most part adventurous, and Brugseh
                    Bey’s ver-dictseems philological!y much more sound,“that these names do not bear
                    a Semitic, or at any rate not a pure Semitic stamp.” The names of persons are
                    the following, as represented by Μ. de Rouge Khetasar, Maursar, Kauisar,
                    Taurteribu, Aktasib, Net’era, Tot’as, Raba-sunana, Tarakaunasa, Mait’arima,
                    Kamaiut’a, Taatur, Sapalel, Sama-risa, Paiusa, Akama, Tuher, Kirabsar. To
                    these’may be added the following from the list of nations of Thothmes III.
                    :—Pirkheta, Ai, A mau, Thuka, Thcl-manna, Legaba, Tunipa, Ni, Ar, Zizal, Zakal,
                    Arzakana (Brugseh, <hi rend="italic">History of Egypt,</hi> ii. 5). No less
                    un-Semitic for the most part are the names of Hittite persons and places which
                    occur on the Assyrian monument. The following is a list of the kings of
                    Khatti-land given by Shalmaneser II. on the monolith inscription: “Sangarof
                    Carchemish, Kundaspi of Kummuch, Arami, son of Gusi, Lalli of Lallid, Chayan,
                    son of Gabar, Girparud of Patin, Girparud of Gamgum” (lines 82, 83), to which
                    should be added “Sapalulmi of Patin” (lines 42, 43), which so strongly reminds
                    one of the name of the king of Khita, Sapalili, mentioned in the treaty between
                    Ramses II. and the Khita. The un-Semitic character of this group of names is the
                    more remarkable, because (as Professor Sayce remarks) Assyrian, being itself a
                    Semitic language, could not help representing foreign Semitic names in a form
                    recognizable as Semitic. How obviously Semitic, for instance, are the names of
                    the kings of Hamath and Damascus, handed down to us in the Assyrian
                    inscriptions! True, one of the above names of Hittite places, Carchemish
                    (“fortress of Chemosh”), has a Semitic air, and the same may be said of Kadesh,
                    the scene of the victory of Ramses II. But (1) it is not quite certain that
                    Carchemish is Semitic (the Assyrians generally reproduce it under the form
                    Gargamis, though sometimes Kargamis), and (2) even if it is Semitic, this may
                    arise from the towns having been occupied by Semites prior to the Hittites. As
                    for Kadesh (in the Egyptian inscriptions, Ketesh), though under the jurisdiction
                    of the Khita, it was reckoned as a Canaanitish or more strictly an Amoritish
                    town (Birch, <hi rend="italic">Egypt,</hi> p. 116), while Orontes (in Egyptian,
                    Arunata) has not even a Semitic appearance. It is true, again, that several of
                    the Hittite proper names are compounded with <hi rend="italic">sar—e.g.,</hi>
                    Khita-sar (the king who warred against Ramses II. ), and that <hi rend="italic"
                    >sar</hi> is evidently the Assyrian for “king” (also Hebrew for “prince ”). But
                    <hi rend="italic">sar</hi> is also found in Egyptian inscriptions; it is in fact
                    of Accadian (non-Semitic) origin, and was therefore borrowed by the Assyrians,
                    before the Hittites and the Egyptians adopted it from them. The form of names
                    like Kheta-sar (see list above) favours the view that the Hittite language was
                    agglutinative, and consequently non-Semitic.</p>
                <p>But this and all other aspects of Hittite culture will appear in a new light when
                    the explorations have made further progress. At present we can only say that the
                    probability is that the Hittites are not Semitic; in fact, they display an
                    originality of genius which is not strikingly characteristic of pure Semitic
                    races. The hypothesis which regards them as the early civilizers of Asia Minor
                    seems confirmed by the position of Carchemish, so favourable to the radiation of
                    civilizing influences. The importance of the Hittite capital in a commercial
                    respect is known to all. The <hi rend="italic">manch</hi> or mina of Carchemish
                    is constantly mentioned on the cuneiform tablets; probably it was of lighter
                    weight than the silver mina in use in Phoenicia (see Mr Barclay V. Head’s letter
                    in <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> Nov. 22, 1879). Of the religious life of the
                    Hittites we are hardly in a position to speak. We know indeed that, like the
                    Hyksos, they worshipped Sutekh (who was localized, like Baal, as the patron of
                    particular cities on the treaty of Ramses II. ), and, like the Canaanites,
                    Astarata or Ashtoreth. The worship of Astarata will account for the name
                    Hierapolis given afterwards, as it seems, to Carchemish, as well as to other
                    Syrian cities (Jerablûs being a corruption of Hierapolis). But beyond this all
                    is dark. Did the Hittites borrow in religious matters from the Assyrians? Had
                    they legends relative to the origin of the world, and in what relation do these
                    stand to the Hebrew narratives? Passing to philology in the narrower sense of
                    the word, we wait longingly for a confirmation of Professor Sayce’s view that
                    the Hittites were the authors of the Hamathite hieroglyphics. No Semitic nation
                    ever invented a syllabic system of writing; the Hittites are in all probability
                    non-Semitic, and from their enterprising character are precisely the people
                    likely to have invented such characters. Professor Sayce has followed up this
                    conjecture by another of no less importance, viz., that the enigmatical Cypriote
                    syllabary is really derived from the hieroglyphics of Hamath. If this be proved
                    (and the propounder of it claims to have the evidence ready), and if the
                    Hittites be really the inventors of the Hamathite hieroglyphics, this wonderful
                    nation steps into a ρositi∙n hardly surpassed by that of any of the nations of
                    the distant East.</p>
