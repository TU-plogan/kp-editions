                    grammar school founded in 1562, the dispensary opened in 1789, the corn exchange
                    opened in 1856, with a room for public meetings, and accommodation for the
                    mechanics’ institute, a library, and a news-room. There are also national and
                    Wesleyan schools, and an infant school for poor children. Among the charities is
                    one for apprenticing orphan boys belonging to the parish. A few fragments still
                    remain of the ancient fortification from which the town takes its name, and many
                    Roman urns and coins have been discovered in the vicinity. Near the confluence
                    of the rivers there at one time existed an ancient labyrinth called the Julian
                    bower. To the south-east of the town there is a spot calledHangman’sCorner,
                    where criminals were formerly executed. The prosperity of the town is chiefly
                    dependent on agriculture and its horse fairs,—that held in August being the
                    largest of· its class in England. Brewing, malting, and currying are carried on,
                    and there is some trade in coal and iron. The population of the parish in 1871
                    was 4947, and of the soke 10,469.</p>

                    fort is said to have been originally constructed by the Romans, refortified and
                    strengthened by Horsa, the brother of Hengest, but shortly afterwards demolished
                    by Vortimer, king of the Britons. The manor at the time of the Norman survey
                    belonged to the king, and after being for an unknown period in private hands,
                    was sold in the reign of Henry III. to the bishop of Carlisle, who received from
                    Henry a charter authorizing him to try felons and hold a court 1eet <hi

                    corroboration his perverted view receives is afforded by the observed fact that
                    Hornbills, in captivity at any rate, never have any fat about them. The part
                    played by the wonderful <hi rend="italic">epithema</hi> in the birds’ economy is
                    altogether unknown.</p>
