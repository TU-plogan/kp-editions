                    the champions of Rome in the war against Alba Longa. Three Alban brothers, named
                    the Curiatii, likewise born at one birth, were opposed to them. The mothers were
                    also twin sisters, who had been married at the same time, and had given birth to
                    their sons on one day. When the Alban army under their king Cluilius lay
                    encamped some miles from Rome, Tullus Hostilius the Roman king agreed with them
                    that the issue should depend on the combat between the two families. Two of the
                    Horatii were soon slain; the third brother feigned flight, and when the Curiatii
                    who were all wounded pursued him without concert he turned and slew them one by
                    one. Now the sister of the Horatii was engaged to one of the Curiatii, and had
                    made for him a beautiful mantle. When the victor, adorned faith this trophy, was
                    entering Rome in triumph, his sister came to greet him by the Porta Capena; but
                    when the fatal mantle, which he wore as a trophy, showed her that her lover had
                    fallen by her brother’s hand, she invoked a curse on him. Enraged at her
                    reproaches, he slew her on the spot; and the body of her that preferred her
                    lover to her country lay unburied till passers by covered it with stones.
                    Horatius was condemned by <hi rend="italic">duumviri,</hi> specially appointed
                    as his judges, to be scourged to death; but his father justified his action, and
                    on appeal the people spared his life, condemning him in penalty to walk with
                    veiled head below the <hi rend="italic">sororium tigillum.</hi> Horatius was
                    afterwards sent to destroy Alba Longa and transport all the inhabitants to Rome.
                    Monuments of the tragic tale were shown by the Romans in the time of Livy :—the
                        <hi rend="italic">pila Horatia</hi> in the forum, where the victor hung his
                    spoils; the beam under which the brother passed, and which stood across a narrow
                    street near the site of the later Flavian Amphitheatre; the sister’s grave
                    outside the gate; the grave of the two Horatii, and those of the three Curiatii
                    where each had fallen; the <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The mythical character of many of these details is evident; and indeed it was
                    even doubtful which of the two sets of brothers belonged to Rome and which to
                    Alba. Under the tale lie historical facts known on other evidence —the close
                    relationship and the final internecine strife between the two cities. Alba, the
                    ancient city on the Alban mount, was the mother of all the Latin cities, and of
                    Rome itself; but the ancient city on the Alban hill had gradually given way to
                    the younger cities in the plain, and was finally destroyed by them, while the
                    inhabitants were transported to Rome and various other Latin cities. With the
                    tale that formed round this fact were connected various monuments on the road
                    that led from the Roman forum to Alba Longa. According to Schwegler, the <hi
                        rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">Cluilia (clueo,</hi> to purify)
                    was probably an attempt to drain the country; and the <hi rend="italic">sororium
                        tigillum</hi> was perhaps the memorial of the substitution of judicial trial
                    for the older patriarchal jurisdiction in case of murder. Dyer, <hi
                        rend="italic">Kings of Pome,</hi> maintains the historical character of the
                    tale.</p>
