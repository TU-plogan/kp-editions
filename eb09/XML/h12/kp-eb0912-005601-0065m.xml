                    tenth year he lost his mother also. Before the litter event, however, the family
                    had been seriously impoverished by a great fire, which destroyed several
                    valuable buildings, but notwithstanding this, the mother left to each of her six
                    children some little fortune. In 1694 the boy Holberg was taken into the house
                    of his uncle, who sent him to the Latin school, and prepared him for the
                    profession of a soldier; but soon after this he was adopted by his cousin Otto
                    Munthe, and went to him up in the mountains. His great desire for instruction,
                    however, at last induced his family to send him back to Bergen, to his uncle,
                    and there he remained, eagerly studying, until the destruction of that city by
                    fire in 1702, when he was sent to the university of Copenhagen. But he soon
                    exhausted his resources, and, having nothing to live upon, was glad to hurry
                    back to Norway, where he accepted the position of tutor in the house of a rural
                    dean at Voss. He soon returned to Copenhagen, where in 1704 he took his degree,
                    and worked hard at French, English, and Italian. But he had to gain his living,
                    and accordingly he accepted the post of tutor once more, this time in the house
                    of Dr Smidt, vice-bishop of Bergen. The good doctor had travelled much, and the
                    reading of his itineraries and note-books awakened such a longing for travel in
                    the young Holberg that at last, in 1706, having scraped together 60 dollars, he
                    went on board a ship bound for Holland. He proceeded as far as Aix-la-Chapelle,
                    where he fell sick of a fever, and suffered so much from weakness and poverty,
                    that he made his way to Amsterdam, and came back to Norway. Ashamed to be seen
                    so soon in Bergen, he stopped at Christianssand, where he lived through the
                    winter, supporting himself by giving lessons in French. In the spring he
                    travelled, in company with a student named Brix, through London to Oxford, where
                    he studied for two years, gaining his livelihood by giving lessons on the violin
                    and the flute. He mentions, with gratitude, the valuable libraries of Oxford,
                    and it is pleasant to record that it was while he was there that it first
                    occurred to him, as he says, “how splendid and glorious a thing it would be to
                    take a place among the authors.” Through London and Elsinore he reached
                    Copenhagen a third time, and began to lecture at the university; his lectures
                    were attended, but he got no money. He was asked in 1709 to conduct a rich young
                    gentleman to Dresden, and on his return journey he lectured at Leipsic, Halle,
                    and Hamburg. Once more in Copenhagen, he undertook to teach the children of
                    Admiral Gedde. Weary with this work, he took a post at Borch College in 1710,
                    where he wrote, but did not print, his first work, <hi rend="italic">A Universal
                    History,</hi> and was permitted to present to King Frederick IV. two manuscript
                    essays on Christian IV and Frederick III. The king soon after presented him with
                    the Rosenkrantz grant of 100 dollars for four years, the holder of which was
                    expected to travel. Holberg accordingly started in 1715, and visited, chiefly on
                    foot, a great portion of Europe. From Amsterdam he walked through Rotterdam to
                    Antwerp, took a boat to Brussels, and on foot again reached Γaris. Walking and
                    skating, he proceeded in the depth of winter to Marseilles, and on by sea to
                    Genoa. On the last-mentioned voyage he caught a fever, and nearly died in that
                    city. On his recovery he pushed, on to Civita Vecchia and Rome. When the spring
                    had come, being still very poor and in feeble health, he started homewards on
                    foot by Florence, across the Apennines, through Bologna, Parma, Piacenza, Turin,
                    over the Alps, through Savoy and Dauphiné to Lyons, and finally to Paris, where
                    he arrived in excellent health. After spending a month in Paris, he walked on to
                    Amsterdam, took sail to Hamburg, and so went back to Denmark in 1716. He spent
                    the next two years in extreme poverty, and published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to Natural and Popular Law.</hi> But at last, in 1718, his talents
                    were recognized by his appointment as professor of metaphysics at the university
                    of Copenhagen; and in 1720 he was promoted to the lucrative chair of public
                    eloquence, which gave him a seat in the consistory. His pecuniary troubles were
                    now at an end. Hitherto he had written only on law, history, and philology,
                    although in a Latin controversy with the jurist Andreas Hover of Flensborg his
                    satirical genius had flashed out. But now, and until 1728, he created an
                    entirely new class of humorous literature under the pseudonym of Hans Mikkelsen.
                    The serio-comic epic of <hi rend="italic">Peder</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Paars,</hi> one of the great classics of the Danish language, appeared in 1719.
                    This poem was a brilliant satire on contemporary manners, and enjoyed an
                    extraordinary success. But the author had offended in it several powerful
                    persons who threatened his life, and if Count Danneskjold had not personally
                    interested the king in him, Holberg’s career might have had an untimely close.
                    During the next two years he published five shorter satires, all of which were
                    well received by the public. The great event of 1721 was the erection of the
                    first Danish theatre in Grönnegade, Copenhagen; Holberg took the direction of
                    this house, in which was played, in September 1722, a Danish translation of <hi
                    rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic">Avare.</hi> Until <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0066-0057"/> this time no plays had been acted in Denmark
                    except in French and German, but Holberg now determined to use his talent in the
                    construction of Danish comedy. The first of his original pieces performed was
                    <hi rend="italic">Den politiske Hand-</hi><hi rend="italic">stöber</hi> (The
                    Pewterer turned Politician); he wrote other comedies with miraculous rapidity,
                    and before 1722 was closed, there had been performed in succession, and with
                    immense success, <hi rend="italic">Den</hi><hi rend="italic">Voegelsindede</hi>
                    (The Waverer), <hi rend="italic">Jean de Prance, Jeppe paa Bjerget,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gert the Westphalian.</hi> Of these five plays, four at least are
                    masterpieces; and they were almost immediately followed by others. Holberg took
                    no rest, and before the end of 1723 the comedies of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barselstuen</hi> (The Lying-in Room), <hi rend="italic">The Eleventh of July,
                    Jakob von Thyboe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Den Bundeslose</hi> (The Fidget), <hi
                    rend="italic">Erasmus</hi><hi rend="italic">Montanus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Don
                    Ranudo, Ulysses of Ithaca, Without Head or Tail, Witchcraft,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Melampe</hi> had all been written, and some of them acted. In 1724
                    the most famous comedy that Holberg produced was <hi rend="italic">Henrik and
                    Pernille.</hi> But in spite of this unprecedented blaze of dramatic genius the
                    theatre fell into pecuniary difficulties, and had to be closed, Holberg
                    composing for the last night’s performance a <hi rend="italic">Funeral of Danish
                    Comedy.</hi> All this excessive labour for the stage had undermined the great
                    poet’s health, and in 1725 he determined to take the baths at Aix-la-Chapelle;
                    but instead of going thither he wandered through Belgium to Paris, and spent the
                    winter there. In the spring he returned to Copenhagen with recovered health and
                    spirits, and worked quietly at his protean literary labours until the great fire
                    of 1728. In the period of national poverty and depression that followed this
                    event, a puritanical spirit came into vogue which was little in sympathy with
                    Holberg’s dramatic or satiric genius. He therefore closed his career as a
                    dramatic poet by publishing in 1731 his acted comedies, with the addition of
                    five which he had no opportunity of putting on the stage. With characteristic
                    versatility, he adopted the serious tone of the new age, and busied himself for
                    the next twenty years with historical, philosophical, and statistical writings.
                    During this period he published his <hi rend="italic">Description of Denmark and
                    Norway</hi> (1729), <hi rend="italic">History of Denmark, Universal Church
                    History, Biographies of Famous Men, Moral Reflections, Description of Bergen
                    (VlWVj, A History of the Jews,</hi> and other learned and laborious
                    compilations. The only poem he published at this time was the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Nicolai Klimii Iter</hi><hi rend="italic">Subterraneum,</hi> 1741,
                    afterwards translated into Danish by Baggesen. When Christian VI. died in 1748,
                    the theatre was reopened and Holberg was appointed director, but he soon
                    resigned this arduous post. His last published work was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistles,</hi> in 5 vols. In 1747 he was made Baron af Holberg. In August 1753
                    he took to his bed, and he died at Copenhagen on the 28th of January 1754, in
                    the seventieth year of his age. He was buried at Sorö, in Zealand. He had never
                    married, and he bequeathed all his property, which was considerable, to Sorö
                    College.</p>
                <p>Holberg was not only the founder of Danish literature and the greatest of Danish
                    authors, but he was, with the exception of Voltaire, the first writer in Europe
                    during his own generation. Neither Pope nor Swift, who perhaps excelled him in
                    particular branches of literary production, approached him in range of genius,
                    or in encyclopaedic versatility. Holberg found Denmark provided with no books,
                    and he wrote a library for her. When he arrived in the country, the Danish
                    language was never heard in a gentleman’s house. Polite Danes were wont to say
                    that a man wrote Latin to his friends, talked French to the ladies, called his
                    dogs in German, and only used Danish to swear at his servants. The single genius
                    of Holberg revolutionized this system. He wrote poems of all kinds in a language
                    hitherto employed only for ballads and hymns; he instituted a theatre, and
                    composed a rich collection of comedies for it; he filled the shelves of the
                    citizens with works in their own tongue on history, law, politics, science,
                    philology, and philosophy, all written in a true and maιdy style, and
                    representing the extreme attainment of European culture at the moment. Perhaps
                    no author who ever lived has had so vast an influence over his countrymen, an
                    influence that is still at work after 200 years.</p>
                <p>The editions of Holberg’s works are legion. During the last twenty-five years
                    five complete editions of the <hi rend="italic">Comedies</hi> have appeared, of
                    which the best is that brought out in 3 vols, by F. L. Lichtenberg, in 1870. Of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ρeder Pααrs</hi> there exist at least twenty-three editions,
                    besides translations in Dutch, German, and Swedish. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iter</hi><hi rend="italic">Subterraneum</hi> has been three several times
                    translated into Danish, ten times into German, thrice into Swedish, thrice into
                    Dutch, thrice into English, twice into French, twice into Russian, and once into
                    Hungarian. The life of Holberg was written by Welhaven in 1858. Among works on
                    his genius by foreigners may be mentioned an exhaustive study by Robert Prutz,
                    1857, and. <hi rend="italic">Holberg</hi><hi rend="italic">considéré comme
