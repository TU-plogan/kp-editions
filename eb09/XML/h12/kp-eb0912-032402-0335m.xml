                    of that sect, and educated at the local schools of the society. What he thus
                    learned was supplemented by studies in natural science and modern literature and
                    languages; and his leisure, spent in the woods and by the brook, fostered that
                    love of nature which brightened every page he wrote and won his readers’
                    sympathy. A poem, published in 1814, on the <hi rend="italic">Influence of
                    Nature and Poetry on National Spirit,</hi> was, so far as we know, his first
                    printed work. He married in 1823 a Quaker lady, Mary Botham of Uttoxeter, who as
                    poetess and prose-writer occupies a place in literature no less distinguished
                    than her husband’s. The first joint book appeared in the year of their marriage
                    under the title, <hi rend="italic">The Forest Minstrel, and other Poems.</hi>
                    After a pedestrian excursion to Scotland, they took up their residence at
                    Nottingham, Howitt engaging in the business of an apothecary. In 1824 he printed
                    <hi rend="italic">A Poet's Thoughts at the Interment of Lord Byron.</hi> We now
                    find that both he and his wife had become known by their contributions, chiefly
                    in rustic verse, to <hi rend="italic">The Literary Souvenir, The Amulet,</hi>
                    and other serial volumes of the day; these were collectively issued with
                    additions in 1827 <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ⅛α</hi><hi rend="italic">The
                    Desolation of</hi> A⅛κm (founded on the plague), <hi rend="italic">The Emigrant,
                    and other Poems.</hi> In 1831 Howitt produced a work of the class specially his
                    own, <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Seasons, or the Calendar of Nature,</hi>
                    in which he drew a picture, from his own observations, of the appearances of
                    mother earth in the garden, in the field, and by the stream during each of the
                    twelve months. Of quite a different character was <hi rend="italic">A Popular
                    History of Priestcraft</hi> (1833), which ran through several editions, and
                    gained him the favour of the active Liberals of his time, and the office of
                    aiderman of Nottingham. It was followed, in 1835, by a cognate work in 2 vols.,
                    entitled, <hi rend="italic">Pantika, or Traditions of the most Ancient</hi><pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0336-0325"/><hi rend="italic">T.imes.</hi> Having removed in
                    1837 to Esher, to be near the literary circles of the metropolis, Howitt there
                    wrote in succession <hi rend="italic">The Rural Life of England,</hi> 2 vols.,
                    1838; <hi rend="italic">Colonization and Christianity,</hi> 1838; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Boy's Country Book,</hi> 1839; and the first series
                    (afterwards extended) of <hi rend="italic">Visits to Remarkable Places, Old
                    Halls, Battlefields, and Scenes illustrative of striking passages in English
                    History and Poetry,</hi> 1840-42, in which he recorded impressions derived on
                    the spot, and pictured each place with its inhabitants—freed, as he says, from
                    the heaviness of the antiquarian rubbish piled upon them. Visiting Heidelberg in
                    1840, primarily for the education of their children, the Howitts remained in
                    Germany two years, studying their neighbours, and busying their pens in
                    descriptions of their new surroundings. In 1841 Howitt produced <hi
                    rend="italic">The Student Life of Germany,</hi> under the pseudonym of “Dr
                    Cornelius,” including translations of some of the most popular German songs. The
                    next year he published <hi rend="italic">The Rural and Domestic Life of Germany,
                    with characteristic Sketches of its Cities and Scenery</hi>; in the year
                    following a translation of Chamisso’s <hi rend="italic">Wonderful History of
                    Peter Schlemihl</hi>; and in 1844 <hi rend="italic">The Life of Jack of the
                    Mill,</hi> a version of Holthaus’s <hi rend="italic">Wanderings of a Journeyman
                    Tailor,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">German Experiences, addressed to the
                    English,</hi> a satire on the social life of Germany. In 1845 appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">Life in Dalecarlia,</hi> translated from the Swedish of Miss
                    Bremer, <hi rend="italic">The Renounced Treasure,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Johnny Darbyshire. The Aristocracy of England, a History of the English
                    People,</hi> a political sketch, appeared in 1846, at the beginning of which
                    year Howitt became connected with the management and proprietorship of <hi
                    rend="italic">The People's Journal,</hi> a weekly paper. A disagreement leading
                    to his withdrawal he started in 1847 a rival called <hi rend="italic">Hoιvitt's
                    Journal,</hi> but this was continued through three or four volumes only, though
                    <hi rend="italic">The Peoples Journal</hi> was merged in it. In 1847 Howitt had
                    translated Ennemoser’s <hi rend="italic">History of Magic,</hi> and written an
                    original work entitled <hi rend="italic">Homes and Haunts of the most eminent
                    British Poets,</hi> 2 vols., which was succeeded by <hi rend="italic">The Hall
                    and the Hamlet, or Scenes and Characters of Country Life,</hi> and very speedily
                    by <hi rend="italic">Stories of English and Foreign Life</hi> (Bohn’s
                    Illustrated Library), in which Mrs Howitt assisted. Then appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">The Year-Book of the Country, or the Field, the Forest, and the
                    Fireside,</hi> and in 1851 a three-volume novel called <hi rend="italic">Madam
                    Dorrington of the Dene.</hi></p>
                <p>Under the associated names of husband and wife an interesting work was brought
                    out in 1852, <hi rend="italic">The Literature and Romance of Northern Europe:
                    constituting a complete History of the Literature of Sweden, Denmark, Norway,
                    and Iceland,</hi> in 2 vols. In June of that year Howitt, with two sons and some
                    friends, set sail for Australia, where he spent two of the most trying years of
                    his life, working in the gold diggings, and visiting Melbourne, Sydney, and
                    other towns. Some account of the novel situations in which he was himself placed
                    is given in <hi rend="italic">A Boy's Adventures in the Wilds of Australia</hi>
                    (1854). Shortly afterwards he returned to the suburbs of London, on this
                    occasion to Highgate, and narrated more elaborately his experiences in <hi
                    rend="italic">Land, Labour, and Gold; or Two Years in Victoria, with Visits to
                    Sydney and Van Diemen's Land,</hi> 2 vols., 1855, a work which speedily became
                    popular, the condition of the Australian colonies being then almost totally
                    unknown in England. A further account of Australian life was given in 1857 in
                    <hi rend="italic">Tallangetta, the Squatter's Home,</hi> 3 vols. The year before
                    Howitt had commenced <hi rend="italic">The Illustrated History of England</hi>
                    for Messrs Cassell, the sixth and last volume of which appeared in 1861. While
                    this work was in progress he wrote in 1859 <hi rend="italic">A Country Book of
                    Amusements,</hi> and, i∏ connexion with Mrs Hall and others, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Boy's Birthday Book,</hi> and in 1860 <hi rend="italic">The Man of the
                    People,</hi> 3 vols. From 1861 to 1864 Mr and Mrs Howitt were occupied on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Ruined Abbeys and</hi><hi rend="italic">Castles</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic">Great Britain,</hi> issuing, before its
                    completion, <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Wye, its</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ruined Abbeys</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Castles</hi> (1863); and the same year Howitt printed a series of <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters on Transportation, and the Cruelties Practised under the
                    Game</hi><hi rend="italic">Laws,</hi> and a work of great research, <hi
                    rend="italic">The History</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Supernatural in all Ages
                    and Nations,</hi><hi rend="italic">and in</hi><hi rend="italic">all Churches,
                    Christian and Pagan, demonstrating</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Universal Faith,</hi> 2 vols. To a man with the mental development of Howitt
                    the miraculous became at all times an absorbing speculation; and he adds to
                    these pages “his own conclusions from a practical examination of the higher
                    phenomena through a course of seven years.” “If,” he reasons, “you crush the
                    supernatural you must crush the universe.” Other works from Howitt’s prolific
                    pen were <hi rend="italic">Sargent's Peculiar</hi> (1864); <hi rend="italic">The
                    History of Discovery</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Australia,</hi> &lt;fcc., 2 vols., 1865; <hi rend="italic">The Ruined Abbeys of
                    the Border</hi> (1865), <hi rend="italic">and of Yorkshire</hi> (1865), jointly
                    with his wife; <hi rend="italic">Woodburn Grange,</hi> a story of English
                    country life, 3 vols., 1867; <hi rend="italic">The Northern Heights of
                    London,</hi> an antiquarian and topographical description of Hampstead,

                    Poems,</hi> 1871; <hi rend="italic">The Religion of Rome,</hi> 1873. Suffering
                    from bronchitis, Howitt had now made Rome his winter residence, passing the
                    summer in Tyrol. He died at Rome on the 3χl of March 1879.</p>
