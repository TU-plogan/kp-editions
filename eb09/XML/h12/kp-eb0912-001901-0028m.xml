                <p><label type="entry">HISTORY</label>, in the most correct use of the word, means
                    the prose narrative of past events, as probably true as the fallibility of human
                    testimony will allow. This definition takes no account of chronicles in verse
                    which were not uncommon in the Middle Ages. With this exception the definition
                    is fairly exact, both in what it comprehends and what it excludes. Obviously
                    prose narrative is not history when it deals with fictitious events, as in the
                    case of the novel; and verse narrative, even when it deals with true events (as
                    in the account of the battle of Salamis in the <hi rend="italic">Persae</hi> of
                    Aeschylus, or Guillaume le Breton’s metrical chronicle of the reign of Philip
                    Augustus), is either more or less than history, and in any case a sub-species by
                    itself.</p>
                <p>In practice, the line between history and mythus is often not easy to draw; but
                    the theoretical distinction is plain. History reposes, however remotely, on
                    contemporary witness to the fact related. Written records are not absolutely
                    indispensable, as tradition <hi rend="italic">may</hi> supply their place and
                    represent authentic contemporary testimony. But tradition is very insecure and
                    apt to be equally inventive and oblivious. It is in the half light of tradition
                    that mythus is born of the creative fancy of man, and the difficulty of
                    separating fact from fiction in this border-land of mingled fable and reality
                    very often amounts to impossibility.</p>
                <p>But even authentic facts alone are not sufficient to constitute history. Many
                    facts and dates are recorded with reference to China, Egypt, and Assyria in
                    olden times, which in all probability are true; but these facts and dates are
                    not enough to give those countries a history. The bare fact that a certain king
                    reigned in a certain year, and conquered or was defeated in battle with a
                    neighbour, is perhaps chronologically valuable, but it is not history. History
                    only attains its full stature when it not only records but describes in
                    considerable fulness social events and evolution, when it marks change and
                    growth, the movement of society from one phase to another.</p>
                <p>The field of history is in consequence very limited, both in time and space, in
                    proportion to the length of human existence and the area of the earth’s surface
                    occupied by man. Primitive and savage man has no history, because the struggle
                    for existence consumes all his energies, and he has neither time nor faculty to
                    think of himself as a social being, much less to make record of social events.
                    But even when partially civilized, mankind is often incapable, not only of
                    writing history, but of furnishing the materials of it. Under a system of caste,
                    or conservative theocracy, or oppressive tradition, as in India, Egypt, and
                    China respectively, the social evolution is so slow that it hardly seems to move
                    at all. The grandson lives among conditions hardly differing from those of the
                    grandfather. In such a state of things the very subject-matter of history is
                    wanting. Nothing attracts less notice than immobility, and large populations
                    have often lived under conditions which for whole generations did not seem to
                    vary. The vast and vacant annals of the East show that the arts of peace and war
                    may attain considerable development without history or its materials being
                    produced in consequence.</p>
                <p>If these views be correct we can only allow a period of about 4000 years as the
                    limit of genuine history in point of time. The beginning would be with the
                    historical books of the Old Testament. Before the Jewish records fail us the
                    Greek have begun. The Romans follow in immediate succession, and the historical
                    thread has never been broken since, though thicker and stronger in some epochs
                    than in others. As regards area, history long dwelt exclusively on the shores of
                    that inland sea which, if not the birthplace of the human race, have at least
                    been the chief training-ground of its early youth and vigorous manhood.
                    Civilization subsequently spread from the Mediterranean to remote islands and
                    continents unknown to the ancients, and history has followed it. No doubt in
                    time both will be coextensive with the globe; but that time has not yet come. It
                    is still useful to remember that the materials of history now rapidly
                    accumulating in the far West, the far South, and even the far East, owe their
                    origin to that antiquity of which we are the heirs, to the civilization which
                    took its rise in those ever memorable centres named Rome, Athens, and
                    Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Early history is never critical and painstaking in the investigation of facts.
                    Neither the historian nor his readers or hearers have reached a stage of culture
                    in which accuracy is highly valued. Early history is essentially artistic, its
                    object is much more to charm the fancy and warm the emotions than to instruct
                    the understanding. A good story, pathetic or humorous, is appreciated for its
                    own sake independently of its truth. Striking pictures, dramatic situations,
                    often told in dialogue, scenes in which virtue and vice are depicted on a
                    colossal scale— these are the chief objects of the early historical writer, who
                    mingles fact and fiction with the same naïveté as his brethren, the writers of
                    the early epos and drama. Indeed, their subjects are often the same,—the heroes
                    whose prowess saved or achieved the national existence, the odious foreign foe
                    who was beaten back; in either case characters appealing strongly to the
                    imagination and the feelings, which would resent cold criticism, but gladly
                    welcome eloquence and passion. History written under these circumstances has
                    much of the character of the prose poem,— <hi rend="italic">carmen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">solutum,</hi> as Quintilian called it. The artistic or imaginative
                    element predominates in it rather to excess. Such is history as written by
                    Herodotus and Froissart. The growth of accurate knowledge in other departments,
                    the increased practice of affairs, the substitution of the political for the
                    heroic and chivalrous sentiment, lead to a more sober and scrutinizing style of
                    history without sacrifice of artistic form. Such is history as written by
                    Thucydides and Tacitus.</p>
                <p>Even a most hasty survey of so vast a subject as the historical literature of the
                    world will be helped by its division.</p>
                <p>History is of two kinds,—the old or artistic type of history, and the new or
                    sociological type. The artistic type, invented by the Greeks, remained the ideal
                    of history till comparatively recent times. Its aim was perfection of literary
                    form, weight and dignity of language, depth of moral and sagacity of political
                    reflexion. It was habitually careless and indifferent as regards research. But
                    its chief distinction from the new history was a negative one; it had no
                    conception of society as an organism, no suspicion of the depth and variety of
                    the social forces which underlie and originate the visible events which it
                    describes, often with admirable power. The new history is to a great extent
                    characterized by opposite qualities. Its preoccupation about literary form is
                    secondary, moral reflexion it rather avoids, but it is laborious beyond
                    precedent in research, and above all it is pregnant with the notion that society
                    is a great aggregate of forces moving according to laws special to it, and
                    similar to those producing evolution and growth analogous to what we see in
                    other forms of life. The remainder of this article could not perhaps be better
                    employed than by a short examination of these two types of history, including
                    some reference to the causes which brought about a transition from one to the
                    other.</p>
                <p>The Greeks were the inventors, and remain the unsurpassed masters, of the
                    artistic form of history. That extraordinary insight into the true conditions of
                    harmony, proportion, and grace which guided them in other departments of
                    literature and art did not forsake them in this. As iq <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0029-0020"/> the drama a few tentative and experimental essays
                    soon led to the master works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Aristophanes, so a few
                    precursors were sufficient to direct Herodotus to the main outlines of
                    historical composition. By one of those mysterious accidents, not to be
                    accounted for, which produce genius, Herodotus was closely followed by the
                    greatest mind that ever applied itself to history. Thucydides remains the
                    unsurpassed ideal of artistic history. As the famous statue of Polycletus,
                    called the Doryphorus, represented the proportions of the human body in such
                    complete beauty “that it was regarded by the ancient artists as a canon of the
                    rules on this point,” so the history of the Peloponnesian War may serve, as its
                    author seemed to know it would, as a model which all may copy but none may
                    equal. Art, differing from science, allows of something like final perfection.
                    Scientific work, however admirable, is always speedily superseded. Great
                    artistic works remain perfect in their kind, and such was the work of
                    Thucydides. History never deviated from the lines laid down by the Greeks till
                    the advent of the modern school towards the end of the last and the beginning of
                    this century. Between Thucydides and Gibbon there is no change of the ideal plan
                    on which history should be written, though of course there is every degree of
                    success and failure in striving after its realization.</p>
                <p>A history of history is a desideratum in literature. The merit of such a work, if
                    properly done, would consist, not only in the criticism of particular authors,
                    but in a comparison of their epochs and social surroundings, and a pointing out
                    how these influenced the character and quality of their historical writing. It
                    is, for instance, worthy of notice that history is far more sensitive and
                    dependent on public freedom than either poetry, science, philosophy, or
                    jurisprudence. All these have flourished under governments more or less
                    despotic, but history never. Tacitus seems to have felt this in the depth of his
                    heart when he said that he was able to write as he did because of the “rara
                    temporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis et quae sentias dicere licet.” Again,
                    certain epochs are favourable to great historians, as periods of war are
                    favourable to great soldiers. Rating the genius of the Greek historians as high
                    as we please, and it is difficult to rate it too high, it is still manifest that
                    they enjoyed exceptional advantages. The political condition of the Greek world
                    in the 4th and 5th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was beyond measure
                    stimulating to men of genuine historical power. That extraordinary collection of
                    small states, full of the most active political life, full of wars, alliances,
                    and brusque revolutions, was a scene of interest, of which no subsequent
                    historian has ever seen the like. In this respect the Greek historians had a
                    privilege similar to that enjoyed by the Greek sculptors. As the gymnasia
                    displayed the finest type of manly beauty and strength ever seen, so the fervent
                    energy and activity of the Greek states presented in unparalleled variety and
                    fulness the features of political life most capable of interesting an historical
                    mind. And it is perhaps hardly too much to say that what the palaestra was to
                    Phidias, that the Peloponnesian War was to Thucydides.</p>
                <p>Continuing this vein of reflexion, we might remark that it is a noteworthy fact
                    that in history alone the Romans came nearest to their Greek models. Copyists in
                    everything else, and inferior copyists, in history they equalled if they did not
                    excel their masters. It is a moot point with many whether Tacitus should not be
                    placed above Thucydides. In any case that steep inferiority which marked Roman
                    imitation of Greek models in every other department was excepted in the case of
                    history. Why was this so Î Obviously because the Romans possessed a robust
                    national life in many respects more lofty and inspiring even than that of the
                    Greeks. The genius of individual men was kindled by the propitious <hi
                    rend="italic">milieu.</hi> And a disastrous <hi rend="italic">milieu,</hi>
                    injurious to all productions of the mind, is peculiarly fatal to history. The
                    decay of historical writing in the later period of the declining Roman empire is
                    a sufficient proof. Nothing so debased as the Augustan History can be found in
                    any other province of Latin literature, and when a man of real power like
                    Ammianus Marcelliuus appears, if we compare him with Claudian in another
                    department, we perceive that the muse of history is more austere than her
                    sisters. The Middle Ages would offer the historian of history ample scope for
                    connecting the quality of historical writing with the social surroundings of the
                    authors. The great monastic houses, such as Malmesbury, St Albans, Eu, and many
                    more, would be shown to have been such schools of history as they were, for very
                    efficient reasons. The appearance of the modern Herodotus, Froissart, would seem
                    meant expressly to show the union of opportunity and genius needed to produce
                    great historical work. It was no accident which gave us the immortal chronicles.
                    The first instalment of the Hundred Years’ War between France and England, the
                    grand but abortive outburst of Parisian democracy under Étienne Marcel, the
                    energetic action of the first serious States-General of France—these were
                    subjects to arrest a real historical eye, such as Froissart had, in spite of his
                    many shortcomings. The dramatic struggle between feudalism and monarchy in the
                    15th century found a competent if somewhat rustic Tacitus in Comines, more
                    friendly but on the whole not less severe to his bourgeois Tiberius, Louis XI.
                    In the stirring times of the 16th century historians abound—Italians, Frenchmen,
                    Dutchmen—too numerous to mention and too distinguished to be passed over with
                    perfunctory notice here. But how much would an historian of history have to say
                    of Fra Paolo, Davila, De Thou, Grotius, to name only the chief? And then occurs
                    a really surprising phenomenon. History disappears from the continent of Europe
                    for a century and a half. Between the Thirty Years’ War and the Seven Years’ War
                    the Continent produced no historians whom the world cares to remember, for
                    Mézeray is remembered, though hardly read, on account of his quaint and
                    occasionally graphic style. Yet this was the great age of Louis XIV., the
                    classic age of French literature and philosophy, and the commencement of French
                    science. But history withered under the blight of the Catholic and monarchical
                    reaction. History was indeed being written in France, the most witty, profound,
                    and graphic since the days of Tacitus; but it was history which the author kept
                    for himself and a remote posterity; not for a hundred years was the world to be
                    permitted to gaze with wonder and admiration on the incomparable memoirs of St
                    Simon. But Rebellious and Revolutionary England gives us Clarendon and
                    Burnett—cause and effect as usual. A review of the 18th century and its
                    performances in history would conclude this interesting retrospect. But it is
                    time to return from this digression to our more immediate subject.</p>
                <p>The old type of history, one might say, was a species of portrait-painting which
                    had often every merit except that of close likeness to the original. Whether it
                    is quite just to say this will be presently considered. But it cannot be denied
                    that the old writers generally thought more of the brilliancy of their colours
                    and the effectiveness of their pictures than of their exact truth. “My siege is
                    finished,” said Vertot, when offered new documents which stultified his
                    narrative. The old masters of history resembled, it is to be feared (if so
                    honourable a comparison can be considered derogatory), the old masters of
                    painting. Both thought little of what we call “local colour,” of close
                    conformity to the scene or object delineated, provided they produced <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n30/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0030-0021"/> striking compositions with grand outline and rich
                    tints which were attractive and beautiful for their own sake. When to this
                    conception of their art we add their general apathy in research, the measure of
                    their sins appears to be filled up in the eyes of a generation like ours, which
                    has brought historical evidence under conditions nearly as stringent as those
                    which regulate the depositions of a court of justice. Still it may occur to some
                    persons that there is another side to this matter, and that the great men of old
                    are not wholly without defence. They were indolent in research no doubt, or
                    rather they did not attach the value that we do to it (if they had, they were
                    not men to have spared their pains), but they were large, sympathetic, and
                    humane. They wrote for a public composed of men of the world and not of
                    specialists. Their manner is somewhat off-hand, but they are neither prigs nor
                    pedants. After all, the most important facts of history, as Auguste Comte has
                    weightily remarked, are the best known and the least dependent on minute
                    rectification for their true appreciation. History has an ethical and
                    psychological side as well as a documentary side supported by elaborate citation
                    of chapter and verse for every statement. Chapter and verse, important as they
                    are, are sometimes a little oppressive and overbearing. The most exhaustive
                    knowledge of authorities will not give a dull man insight into character, or
                    enable him to realize and paint a great historic scene, or teach him to use with
                    skill the mass of erudition under which he staggers. It may be said generally,
                    exceptions of course excepted, that the old historians were strong where their
                    successors are weak, and the converse. Aiming chiefly at portraiture, they
                    succeeded in it, as was only natural. Amid a crowd of errors on smaller matters,
                    they often catch the true expression of a physiognomy, and hit off the salient
                    points of a character with an insight and success which subsequent inquiry is
                    often unable to modify. Bacon’s portrait of Henry VII. remains substantially
                    correct, though he wrote his book in four months, remote from the means of
                    knowledge accessible even in his day, which did not represent a tithe of the
                    knowledge accessible now. Even down to the practice of introducing fictitious
                    speeches into their histories, the old writers are not without defence. Nothing
                    more than these speeches has moved the contempt and indignation of modern
                    critics. Macaulay says the practice was absurd, and that if an English writer
                    were to attempt it now he would be laughed to scorn. Yet men of the calibre of
                    Macchiavelli, ^Grotius, and Bacon resorted to it. It is more a question of form
                    and less of substance than at first glance appears. It amounts to this— How are
                    we to render our impression of a past epoch <hi rend="italic">1 We may give</hi>
                    it in broad statement, in carefully reasoned argument, supported by apt
                    quotation and appropriate footnotes. This is the modern plan, and, to speak
                    frankly, unquestionably the best. But it is well to listen without impatience to
                    what can be said for the old plan by the other side. Mr Spedding, referring to
                    the speeches which Bacon introduced into his history of Henry VIL, says:—“My own
                    opinion is that the reader is less liable to be deceived by history written on
                    this principle than upon the modern plan, though the modern be apparently the
                    more scrupulous. The records of the past are not complete enough to enable the
                    most diligent historian to give a connected narrative in which there shall not
                    be many parts resting on guesses or inferences or unauthenticated rumours. He
                    may guess for himself, or he may report other people’s guesses; but guesses
                    there must be. The advantage of the old practice is that the invention appears
                    in the undisguised form of invention; whereas the modern practice, by
                    scrupulously eschewing everything like avowed and deliberate invention, leaves
                    it to be supposed that what remains is all fact, whereas in most cases of the
                    kind the writer is but reporting his own or another man’s conjecture, just as
                    much as if he had sat down deliberately to compose a soliloquy or a speech in
                    the first person” (Spedding’s <hi rend="italic">Bacon,</hi> vol vi. p. 76).
                    Every one must be glad to see even plausible reasons suggested for not regarding
                    the funeral oration of Pericles or the speech of Galgacus as “absurdities.”
                    Perhaps the truest view of this introduction of speeches into their histories by
                    the ancients and their modern imitators is that it was their mode of offering
                    generalizations. They adopted the concrete and dramatic form when we should use
                    the abstract and impersonal, and perhaps, as Mr Spedding remarks, this practice
                    was not necessarily exposed to more error than ours.</p>
                <p>We have now to advert to the causes which led to the transformation of history
                    from the old to the new type.</p>
                <p>The inferior quality of history in the 17th century and the first half of the
                    18th is the more remarkable from the contrast presented by the brilliancy of
                    contemporary literature in other departments. The age of Louis XIV. in France,
                    as already remarked, and the age of Anne in England produced no histories of
                    superior merit. Bossuet ’ s famous discourse on universal history is no
                    exception, being much more an eloquent sermon than a history in the true sense
                    of the word. Written by inferior men from a low point of view, or no point of
                    view at all, history at last sank to such a degree in the public esteem as to be
                    spoken of in a tone of contempt. Dr Johnson openly despised it, and D’Alembert
                    did nearly the same. And yet the time produced great antiquaries—Madox and Rymer
                    in England, D’Achery and Mabillon in France, Maratori in Italy, Leibnitz in
                    Germany. But history had no stamina or muscle. It was also from our point of
                    view blind and utterly stupid: it could not see the plainest facts, and it
                    perverted the facts it did see. Not only the inferior men whose names are barely
                    remembered and whose works are entirely forgotten, the Daniels, the Vellys, the
                    Creviers, the Hooks, the Eckards, but men of such magnitude as Hume and
                    Robertson, Gibbon and Voltaire, often show such an unintelligence as to the past
                    that this unintelligence itself becomes an interesting historical phenomenon,
                    casting no slur on the great writers who displayed it, but deserving
                    consideration for its own sake.</p>
                <p>When 18th century writers are arraigned for their defective appreciation of the
                    Middle Ages (the great stumbling-block) and remote periods generally, their
                    critics forget the historical positions of the men they criticize. To write
                    history in the 18th century was something very different from what it had been
                    before, and this in several ways. First of all, the mere lengthening of the
                    historic retrospect had enormously increased the field of historical survey. A
                    writer of the 18th century looked back on nearly as much as we do; he had behind
                    him the recent modern period, the long Middle Age, the barbarian epoch, those of
                    Greece and Rome. And it was honourable to the men of the 18th century that they
                    did not shrink from the task of writing on this immense expanse of history,
                    imperfectly as they were prepared for it. It seems to be sometimes forgotten
                    that most of the historical writing of the ancients, and a good part of that of
                    the moderns up to the 18th century, had been the writing of contemporary
                    history, or history of a quite recent past. This is true of Herodotus (when he
                    is not merely a traveller telling travellers’ stories), of Thucydides, of
                    Polybius, of Sallust, of Tacitus, of Guicciardini, of Fra Paolo, of Davila, of
                    Grotius, of Clarendon. Contemporaneous history may bring out some of the highest
                    qualities of an historian—perspicacity, weightiness of judgment and language,
                    skill in narrative, and so forth. But one quality it does not need and cannot
                    display, insight into a remote age differing in culture,^politics, and religion
                    from those amid which the historian lives. Yet it was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n31/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0031-0022"/> precisely the history of remote ages which the
                    writers of the 18th century boldly undertook to treat. That they often failed is
                    not surprising. It would have been a miracle if they had succeeded.</p>
                <p>We are now so imbued with the notions of growth and development in all forms that
                    we find no difficulty in applying them to society as well as other phenomena.
                    But these notions were all but entirely wanting in the 18th century; indeed,
                    they did not fully emerge till the 19 th had run a good portion of its course.
                    It was difficult for all true sons of the 18th century to conceive of men or of
                    societies different from the men and the societies they saw around them. Or if
                    they were forced to admit that men could exist under conditions widely differing
                    from those in which they themselves lived, they unhesitatingly pronounced them
                    barbarians, unpolished, hardly worthy of attention. They consequently speak of
                    past ages habitually in a tone of supercilious contempt which is to us highly
                    amusing. Men who differed in every other opinion agreed in this. “The Athenians
                    of the age of Demosthenes were a people of brutes, a barbarous people,” said Dr
                    Johnson; and Voltaire was quite of his way of thinking on this point <hi
                    rend="italic">{Diet.</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophique,</hi> art. “Anciens et
                    Modernes ”). With such views or rather feelings it was impossible to understand
                    the past; they did not even wish to do so. They mostly regarded their own age as
                    the only one worthy of respect and admiration, the only one in which “polite
                    manners” had existed. The past to them was mainly a record of crime, ignorance,
                    folly, and fanaticism (notice the way in which the sober Robertson speaks of the
                    crusades); and they did not even wish to see it as it really was. It is obvious
                    that such men could not write history as we understand it. The moral prejudices
                    of the age shut out a true view of past times. Indeed they preferred a distorted
                    view, if it represented better their notions of the seemly and the noble. They
                    had always a tendency to dress up the past in the garb of the present. The
                    French writers surpassed the English in this foible. For them the only ideal of
                    a king is Louis XI V., and all kings must be made to resemble him more or less,
                    though of course they were not so great. This disposition reaches its acme of
                    absurdity in Scipion Dupleix, historiographer of France, who died in 1661.
                    Describing the baptism of Clovis, he represents the barbarian Frank as
                    approaching St Remi, “with lofty port and grave demeanour, richly dressed,
                    scented, and powdered, with long wig carefully curled and perfumed according to
                    the custom of the ancient French kings.” More serious is the profound
                    misapprehension of every great character and great period which differed from
                    the current pattern. The unworthy interpretation of all political and religious
                    phenomena with which the writers were unfamiliar, by sagacious references to
                    state and priestcraft, is also apt at times to appear to us wilfully perverse,
                    and even disingenuous. We may. be sure it was nothing of the kind, and only
                    resulted from the inadequate degree of culture then attained.</p>
                <p>But the historians in question were hindered not only by prejudice which they
                    could not avoid from understanding the past; they were also hindered by a want
                    of knowledge which it was impossible for them to have. To say nothing of the
                    larger conceptions of society which we have only recently acquired, they were
                    unfurnished with those preparatory means of accurately observing the past which
                    were soon to be discovered. The science of economics, as we shall presently see,
                    was about to throw a broad and vivid light on many hitherto obscure problems of
                    history. But the writers in question did not yet enjoy the benefit of it, and
                    surely the fault was none of theirs. When we see a man of the genius and
                    erudition of Montesquieu <hi rend="italic">{Grandeur et Décadence</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Domains,</hi> c. 17) gravely ascribing the decline of old Rome
                    to the fact that all the gold and silver after the division of the empire were
                    carried to Constantinople, we realize the value of true conceptions relative to
                    the wealth of nations. But in Montesquieu’s time the precious metals were
                    regarded as the sole or chief sources of wealth, and he applied without
                    hesitation to history a principle which he saw statesmen apply without
                    hesitation to politics. Again, Gibbon, writing on the same subject, the decline
                    and fall of Rome, considers the real cause to have been the reluctance of the
                    soldiers to wear defensive armour. It seems hardly credible, but here are his
                    words :—“They (the soldiers) complained of the weight of their armour, which
                    they seldom wore; and they successively obtained permission to lay aside both
                    their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy weapons of their ancestors dropped
                    from their feeble hands, and their pusillanimous indolence may be considered the
                    immediate cause of the downfall of the empire” (chap. 27). Montesquieu and
                    Gibbon were men of an historical genius second to none. Yet they could descend
                    to such trivialities, and the reason was that the true sources of national
                    wealth and military strength had not been laid open in their day. It would be
                    easy to multiply examples of a similar kind, taken from the ablest writers, in
                    which the most superficial explanation of wide-reaching events is hastily caught
                    at, as if one were to explain an earthquake by a scratching of the earth’s
                    surface. In fact the old writers might be likened to surveyors as contrasted
                    with geologists. They have little or no conception of the forces at work under
                    the surface they see.</p>
                <p>But a change was near—a change in feeling and a change in knowledge. That
                    singular modulation of key in the moral life of Europe, often called, for want
                    of abetter term, the Romantic movement, which arrested and surprised the
                    attention of the latter half of the 18th century, was felt in relation to
                    history as well as to philosophy, politics, and religion. Whether represented by
                    the fierce rebellion of Rousseau in France, or a milder literary reform in
                    England and Germany, it essentially consisted in a weariness of and
                    disenchantment with the present and the recent past, in a vague feeling after
                    ideas and emotions outside the conventional circle in which men had been
                    contented to live for several generations. The tastes and the tempers of men
                    changed with a strange rapidity. The 18th century philosophy, as it is called,
                    lately so high and apparently secure, was cast out with contumely. The recent
                    idols—Locke, Hume, Voltaire, Diderot—were smitten down, and others needless to
                    name were put in their place. The whole movement is now seen to have been
                    retrograde, and finally abortive, though temporarily successful. But it had its
                    <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre</hi> and even its uses, as all social phenomena
                    have. Among its uses was the service it rendered to history. As it was a first
                    principle with the Romantics to burn what their predecessors had worshipped and
                    the converse, the past which had been recently an object of contempt was put in
                    the place of honour. Especially the Middle Age, so unjustly despised, seemed to
                    rise out of its grave as a lovely vision full of knights and chivalry,
                    troubadour song, and Gothic architecture, the latter just beginning to be
                    appreciated. Where men had only recently seen barbarism, superstition, and
                    ignorance, they and their sons saw an enchanted land of beauty, piety, and
                    grace. Then came Sir Walter Scott, who turned a current already flowing fast
                    into a headlong torrent. The Middle Age was studied eagerly, sympathetically,
                    perhaps a little too much so; zeal never is according to knowledge. But the
                    bringing of the Middle Age into the circle of serious historic study had an
                    influence beyond its immediate object. When men had brought themselves to study
                    and understand 11th century popes and emperors, monasticism, feudalism,
                    scholasticism, they became bold and capable of further <pb break="no"

                    heroic ages of Christendom, the heroic ages of Greece were opened to explorers.
                    And soon all exclusiveness disappeared. The whole past history of man was felt
                    to be worthy of man’s study,—a wide field into which many labourers entered. So
                    much for the change in feeling.</p>
                <p>No less a change had taken place in the condition of knowledge. Speculation had
                    for a long time been feeling its way to a closer contact with the problems
                    suggested by the growing wealth and industry of the modern world. Adam Smith in
                    his memorable work resumed, co-ordinated, and enlarged the labours of his
                    numerous predecessors, and placed the study of economics on a new and positive
                    basis. But the suggestive stimulus of his researches spread beyond the limits of
                    the science with which he was immediately concerned. The indirect services
                    rendered by political economy to history have not perhaps been adequately
                    recognized. The elucidation of the sources of wealth in the present became a
                    means of explaining the prosperity and decay of states in the.past, which soon
                    led to valuable results, the more striking as they were unexpected. Hitherto
                    wealth had been thought a source rather of degeneracy than of improvement. The
                    great danger was always understood to be “luxury.” Poverty was the parent of
                    virtue. Primitive times were virtuous because they were poor. Pagan philosophers
                    and Christian saints had agreed in condemning riches as the source of all evil,
                    and denying the rich man a high place in their ideal republic or the city of
                    God. Political economy cleared up the confusion of thought here implied. The
                    wealth of states has nothing to do with the excessive opulence of a small class.
                    Never has the mass of the people in any country or in any age suffered from an
                    overabundance of wealth. The excessive wealth of the few generally means the
                    poverty of the many. In short, the evil lies in the great inequality of the
                    distribution of wealth. These common-places of economics would have been
                    paradoxes in the early part of the 18th century, and the historians of that age
                    show a profound ignorance of their bearing, as was only natural. So, when they
                    have to explain the decay of a state they seek to show that it had lost its gold
                    and silver, or that luxury had made fearful inroads, or that martial valour had
                    somehow strangely declined. The notion that poverty in the mass of the people
                    was very often the chief and sometimes the only cause did not occur to them.
                    When therefore Adam Smith devoted the third book of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth
                    of Nations</hi> to “the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations,” it
                    seemed as if a lamp had suddenly been lit in a dark place. That book was in
                    truth a lofty historical review of the facts of the past, guided by the
                    principles of economic science. The question which has already come before us,
                    and which exercised so much, as well it might, the thinkers of that age, the
                    decline of Rome, was approached in a much more promising manner when one element
                    of it, the decay of agriculture in Italy, was spoken of thus :—“Tillage in that
                    part of ancient Italy which lay in the neighbourhood of Rome must have been very
                    much discouraged by the distributions of corn which were frequently made to the
                    people, either gratuitously or at a very low price. This corn was brought from
                    the conquered provinces, of which several, instead of taxes, were obliged to
                    furnish a tenth part of their produce at a stated price. The low price at which
                    this corn was distributed to the people must necessarily have sunk the price of
                    what could be brought to the Roman market from Latium or the ancient territory
                    of Rome, and must have discouraged its cultivation in that country.” This was
                    catching a glimpse of a <hi rend="italic">vera causa</hi> of the effect to be
                    explained, and the vein of thought thus opened proved to be richer the further
                    it was explored.</p>
                <p>Both the moral and the intellectual tendencies at work to produce a new temper
                    with regard to history received an incalculable impetus from the French
                    Revolution. That cataclysm revealed the deeper forces of society which had lain
                    silent and unsuspected under the deceitful calm of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ancien</hi><hi rend="italic">regime</hi> in its latter days. It was very
                    certainly a revelation, though light came from the flames of Tophet, in Mr
                    Carlyle’s phrase. Men saw the depth of the abyss over which they had lived in
                    quiet ignorance, and their notions on man, society, and history underwent a
                    great change. Passions undreamed of were let loose, and the passions of the
                    present threw light on those of the past. History was read with new eyes.
                    “Whenever,” says a man who lived through the tempest and profited as much as any
                    one by it,—“Whenever,” says Niebuhr, “an historian is reviving past times, his
                    interest in them and sympathy with them will be the deeper the greater the
                    events he has witnessed with a bleeding or rejoicing heart” (Preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist, of Rome).</hi> Few generations have seen events which
                    alternately made men’s hearts bleed and rejoice more passionately than Niebuhr’s
                    own, and none have ever stimulated history so much. With the peace of 1815
                    historical studies acquired an activity and scope they never had before. All
                    history, it was perceived, needed rewriting from new points of view, with more
                    knowledge, deeper insight, keener sympathy. The French led the van of the new
                    movement with their usual brilliancy and mastery of literary form. But it was
                    their position as the nearest witnesses and the greatest sufferers and gainers
                    by the Revolution which did most to open their eyes. A truly illustrious band of
                    scholars and writers under the Restoration, the Monarchy of July, raised history
                    into a position of honour it had never enjoyed before. Michaud, the two
                    Thierrys, Sismondi, Guizot, De Barante, Michelet, and many more rendered
                    services to history which must not be forgotten because on many points their
                    labours have been superseded. It is indeed a capital proof of the merit of their
                    labours that they furnished the means and the incentive to their supersession, a
                    proof that their studies were vital and progressive. The Germans, with their
                    solid erudition, were not slow in following the French. Between the two, the
                    Middle Ages, Greek and Roman antiquity, and the history of the Christian Church
                    were studied with a minuteness and breadth never known before. History had
                    entered on its modern phase.</p>
                <p>This is not the place to dwell in detail on the achievements of the modern school
                    of historians. The whole field of history has been explored afresh with such
                    superior insight, knowledge, and just conception of the task in hand that all
                    historical writings anterior in date to the end of the 18th century are entirely
                    superseded, with the single exception perhaps of Gibbon, who alone, as Mr
                    Freeman says, has not been set aside by subsequent research. Ancient history,
                    chiefly in consequence of the extraordinary zeal and diligence of the Germans in
                    what they call the science of antiquity (Alterthumswissenschaft), has become a
                    reality, vivid in interest, and fruitful in knowledge, instead of the nebulous
                    unreality it had been before. The rejection of the fabulous elements in the
                    histories of Greece and Rome was the first step, but a long one, which it
                    required many years and much effort to make. The next was to obtain a firm grasp
                    of the idea that the Greeks and Romans were living men, and not statues like the
                    Elgin Marbles, and to look at their politics, institutions, and religions with
                    the discriminating eye of common sense, and a real wish to see them as they
                    were. The true nature of Athenian democracy, of the Spartan oligarchy, of the
                    commons and patricians of Rome, of the party struggles which caused and
                    justified the transition from the republic to the empire, has been put in a
                    clear light, which can hardly be appreciated by those who are not aware of the
                    darkness which it replaced. Points of <pb break="no"

                    religion, government, institutions, taxation, and law of the ancient states have
                    been opened up, of which the possibility in the old days was not suspected. The
                    sociological knowledge of the present has illumined the past, an interesting
                    example of which is afforded by the <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> between
                    the English dominion in India and the Roman provincial administration.</p>
                <p>The history of the Middle Age shows even greater results, and greater innovation,
                    to which allusion has been already made. The great difficulty was the papacy.
                    Between the Catholics, who regarded it as of divine institution, and the
                    Protestants, who regarded it as a manifestation of Antichrist, and the sceptics,
                    who despised both and regarded it as mere superstition, this great centre around
                    which the life of the Middle Ages revolved had been unknown or misknown to a
                    degree of absurdity. Gradually, as the 19th century arose wiser and sadder out
                    of the chaos of the French Revolution, the immense part played by the church was
                    at first dimly suspected, and at last with increasing clearness perceived. This
                    must on every account be regarded as the greatest achievement of the modern
                    school; it implied the unlearning of so many old errors, the acquiring of so
                    many new truths, above all, the repression of so many deeply-rooted prejudices.
                    It restored the continuity of history, in which the Middle Ages had hitherto
                    appeared as an unexplained gap,—an unwelcome wedge of barbarism thrust between
                    the ancient and modern civilizations.</p>
                <p>After the Middle Ages, the period which has been most illumined by the new lamp
                    of history is that of the early church and the whole subject of religious dogma
                    and institutions. In spite of the fierce controversies which have raged over
                    this region, a large residuum of undisputed fact has been rescued from ignorance
                    and prejudice, and church history is no longer a legend, but one of the most
                    interesting chapters in the annals of the human mind.</p>
                <p>As regards modern history, we are oppressed and nearly overwhelmed with the mass
                    of new materials and new discoveries which have been launched upon us. The
                    diligent publication of state papers and documents, which all civilized states
                    have taken in hand, has exceeded in the last half century all that had been done
                    before in that direction. The result is that there are few periods of modern
                    history which are not far better known to us than they were to the
                    contemporaries who lived in them. But history in this field cannot boast of such
                    laurels as she has won in the field of antiquity and the Middle Ages. There has
                    been no great reversal of old points of view, no great triumph of historical
                    perspicacity piercing through traditional error down to latent truth. Modern
                    history has won its victories more by weight of metal than by the skill of its
                    commanders, not that the generals have lacked skill, but they have had less
                    occasion to display it.</p>
                <p>The history of institutions has received much attention in recent times, and
                    promises to be one of the most fruitful veins of inquiry yet opened, and this in
                    reference both to primitive institutions, which are rather prehistorical than
                    historical, and the constitutions of states which have reached adult political
                    life. The old Aryan tenure of land and village communities, and ancient law,
                    whether in old Rome or modern Bengal, have been the subjectsof elaborate
                    investigation, embodied in works which mark a new departure in knowledge. The
                    institutional history of political states is at the present momenr perhaps the
                    subject which attracts the most lively attention of scholars. It is not confined
                    to the constitutional history of England, though England, as the mother of
                    parliaments, has a fair claim to priority of interest. But the subject is
                    narrowed and degraded by contemplating it from the point of view of modern
                    politics, and chiefly in reference to the popular freedom or national wellbeing
                    produced. The earnest historical inquirer is as impartial as the pathologist who
                    studies disease equally with health. The institutions of despotism have their
                    <hi rend="italic">raison</hi><hi rend="italic">Tetre</hi> and normal evolution
                    as well as those of free governments, and the scientific historian will neglect
                    the one as little as the other. In any case the history of the institutions of
                    Europe from the times of the Frankish empire to the end of the French monarchy
                    offers the widest field for courageous historical research. It has absorbed and
                    transcended all those inquiries which used to be included under the somewhat
                    jejune title of the history of civilization. Institutions in the secular order,
                    aud religions in the spiritual order, are now seen to be the most massive and
                    permanent factors in human life, capable indeed of evolution and change, but
                    little susceptible to the immediate action of man’s intelligence and will, and
                    yielding only to the new modifications brought about by time and the gradual
                    transformation of ideas and moral conceptions, the result of increased
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>It is hardly necessary to add that a broad distinction must be made between
                    history and what has been called the philosophy of history, a term now replaced
                    by the far better one “sociology,” invented by A. Comte. Sociology has the
                    purely scientific aim of investigating the nature and constitution of societies,
                    to discover the laws which regulate their growth and decay, to do in short for
                    them what biology has already done for the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
                    History, while it can never again dispense with the assistance of sociology,
                    remains occupied with the description of the social organism (at a given period)
                    in its <hi rend="italic">ensemble,</hi> and the term “descriptive sociology” has
                    been suggested as an improvement on the old one, history. We may question
                    whether the innovation will be accepted or is needed. The human interest
                    attaching to the story of man’s past fortunes will always provoke the means of
                    its own satisfaction, and there is little doubt that history, the name and the
                    thing, as the highest form of prose literature, will continue to instruct and
                    console mankind to the remotest generations. (j. c. <hi rend="smallcaps"
