                    (1745-1809), dramatist and miscellaneous writer, was born 10th December 1745
                    (old style) in Orange Court, Leicester Fields, London. His father, besides
                    having a shoemaker’s shop, kept riding horses for hire; but he fell into
                    difficulties some six years later, and was reduced ultimately to the necessity
                    of hawking pedlery from village to village. The son accompanied his parents in
                    their tramps, and besides the hardships incident to such a life had often to
                    endure the consequences of his father’s passionate outbreaks of temper, which
                    were, however, succeeded by equally violent transports of affection. In such
                    circumstances he was disposed to regard it as an extraordinary piece of good
                    fortune when he succeeded in procuring the situation of stable boy at Newmarket,
                    an employment in which he manifested great coolness and courage, and acquired
                    high proficiency. Previous to this he had received a pretty good education, and
                    at Newmarket he spent his evenings chiefly in miscellaneous reading and the
                    study of music. Gradually he also succeeded in obtaining a competent knowledge
                    of French, German, and Italian. On the expiry of his term of engagement as
                    stable boy he returned to assist his father, who had again resumed his trade of
                    shoemaker in London; but after marrying in 1765, he procured the office of
                    teacher in a small school in Liverpool. His subsequent career, like his earlier
                    life, was hard and chequered, but it must suffice to state that, after failing
                    in an attempt to set up a private school, he followed for several years the
                    profession of an actor, often at a very meagre salary, and that he was more
                    successful as a dramatist and novelist, but suffered much and frequent anxiety
                    from pecuniary embarrassments and repeated disappointments. He died 23d March
                    1809 from enlargement of the heart, brought on, it is supposed, by the failure
                    of several of his dramatic pieces. He was a member of the Society for
                    Constitutional Reform, and on that account was, in 1794, indicted of high
                    treason, but acquitted. The best known dramas of Holcroft are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Duplicity, The School for Arrogance, The Road to Ruin,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Deserted Daughter.</hi> Among his novels may be mentioned <hi
                    rend="italic">Alwyn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hugh Trevor.</hi> He was also the

                    several works from the French and German with considerable elegance. The
                    interest which still attaches to his career is, however, less on account of the
                    intrinsic merit of his literary performances than his peculiarly chequered life
                    and his persevering struggle to elevate himself above the ignorant and sordid
                    condition of his early years. His <hi rend="italic">Memoirs written by himself
