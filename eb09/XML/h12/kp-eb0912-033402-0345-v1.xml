                <p><label type="entry">HUESCA</label>, one of the three provinces into which the old
                    northern Spanish kingdom of Aragon was divided in 1833, is bounded on the N. by
                    France, E. by Leridà, S. and S.W. by Saragossa, and W. and N.W. by Navarre. The
                    total area is 7530 square miles. The surface is mountainous, especially in the
                    north, which is occupied by the lofty offshoots of the Pyrenees, which there
                    reach in Monte Perdido (Mont Perdu) the height of 11,430 feet. The chief river
                    is the Cinca; but the want of natural streams has in some measure been made up
                    for by a system of irrigation. Mineral springs are numerous throughout the
                    province. The climate varies much according to the region; in the north cold
                    winds from the snow-capped Pyrenees prevail, while in the south the warm summers
                    are often unhealthy from the humidity of the atmosphere. The leading industry of
                    Huesca is agriculture, although only a limited proportion of the soil is under
                    cultivation. There is good summer pasturage on the mountains, where cattle,
                    sheep, and swine are reared. The mountains are richly clothed with forests of
                    pine, beech, oak, and fir, and the southern regions produce abundant crops of
                    cereals, vines, mulberries, and numerous kinds of fruits and vegetables. The
                    mineral resources include argentiferous lead, copper, iron, and cobalt, with
                    limestone, millstone, gypsum, granite, and slate. The mining industry was
                    formerly much more important, but the difficulties of transport caused by the
                    absence of good roads have much hindered the development of this and other
                    resources of the province. Huesca exports timber, cereals, wine, oil, and some
                    cattle, and imports iron, flax, and colonial and foreign goods. The
                    manufactures, which are unimportant, include brandy, wine, soap, linen,
                    woollens, baize, and common crockery. The population in 1877 was 252,165.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Huesca,</hi> chief town of the above province, and the seat
                    of a bishop, is pleasantly situated on an eminence commanding an extensive view
                    over the surrounding fertile plain. It stands near the right bank of the Isuela,
                    35 miles north east of Saragossa. The town bears many traces of its antiquity.
                    The streets in the older part are narrow and crooked, though clean, and many of
                    the houses witness by their size and style to the former magnificence, and by
                    their neglected and ruined aspect to the present decay of the place. The newer
                    streets are wide, and the houses have some claims to regularity. There are
                    several squares and plazas, in one of which rises the imposing Gothic cathedral,
                    begun in 1400 and finished in 1515, and enriched with fine carving. In the same
                    plaza is the old palace of the kings of Aragon, formerly given up for the use of

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Sert.</hi> 15).
                    Among the other prominent buildings are the interesting parish churches (San
                    Pedro, San Martin, and San Juan), the archiépiscopal palace, the town-house, and
                    various benevolent and religious houses. Huesca manufactures cloth, pottery,
                    bricks, and leather. Its chief trade is in exporting fruit and cereals, and in
                    importing linen, cloth, silk, hardware, and colonial produce. The population in
                    1877 was 7760.</p>
                <p>Huesca is a very ancient town. Strabo (iii. 161, where some editors read <hi
                        rend="italic">Ileosca)</hi> describes it as a town of the Ilergetes, and the
                    scene of Sertorius ’ s death; while Pliny places the Oscenses in <hi

                        cit.)</hi> calls it a large city. Julius Caesar names it <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vencedora</hi>; and the name by which Augustus knew it, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Urbs victrix</hi><hi rend="italic">Osca,</hi> was stamped on its coins, and
                    is still preserved on its arms. It fell under Saracen rule; but in 1096 Pedro I.
                    of Aragon regained it, after winning the decisive battle of Alcoraz, as the
                    termination of the two years’ siege.</p>
