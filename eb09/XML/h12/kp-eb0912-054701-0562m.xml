                    >porifera,</hi> or Sponges) have been divided,— recognized as such in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Coelentera,</hi> to which the reader is referred.
                    It results from observations made by Ernst Haeckel, since that article and the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Actinozoa</hi> were penned, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cteηophora</hi> should not be regarded as a class equivalent to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Actinozoa,</hi> nor as
                    a subdivision of the latter class, but that they must be considered as a
                    peculiar modification of the medusiform <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> (see
                    final paragraph). If this conclusion be accepted, it will be necessary to divide
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> into two primary groups or grades, for which
                    the names <hi rend="italic">Polypo-morpha</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cteηophora</hi> are proposed.</p>
                <p>Ι⅛e <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> correspond to the Linnaean genera <hi

                    >Sertularia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Medusa.</hi> The name was applied by
                    Huxley in 1856 to a group corresponding to that termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydromedusoe</hi> by Vogt (1851) and <hi rend="italic">Medusoe</hi> by Leuckart
                    (1853), and embracing the forms placed by Gegenbaur in his <hi rend="italic"

                    are excessively difficult to obtain in a state fit for investigation, has
                    greatly extended within the last five years. Whilst in the two decades preceding
                    this period the admirable researches of Huxley, Gegenbaur, Agassiz, and Allman
                    had brought to light and systematized a vast mass of information with regard to
                    these organisms, the later observations of Claus, the Hertwigs, Haeckel, and
                    Metscħnikoff, have corrected, extended, and added to their history, especially
                    in respect of embryological and histological detail. An epitome of the present
                    condition of our knowledge of the group is afforded by the subjoined tabular
                    classification of its families, orders, and sub-classes.</p>
                <p>The definition and synonymy of the divisions recognized will be entered into,

                    the fundamental membranous constituents of which the most varied parts of the

                    and air-bladders— are built up in the adult condition. Huxley also pointed out

                    embryo. The endoderm and the ectoderm, which present themselves, as is now

                    either an unbarbed thread or one in which the barbs are confined to three at the

                    are the equivalent forms in other animals groups) as a person. Either this
                    person elongates and develops tentacles in a circlet around or near the mouth,
                    and usually becomes fixed by the aboral pole of the sac-like body, or the sac
                    gradually assumes the form of a clapper-bell or of an umbrella with greatly
                    thickened handle, the mouth being placed at the free end of the handle or of the
                    clapper, and the animal freely swimming by the contractions and expansions of
                    the dome of the bell (disc of the umbrella). The two forms of persons are known,
                    —the former as the “hydriform” (2, 3 in fig. 16), the latter as the “medusiform”
                    (4, 5, 6 in fig. 16).</p>
                <p>The HYDRIFORM <hi rend="smallcaps">persons</hi> usually occur as fixed branching
                    •colonies or trees (figs. 36 and 37) produced by lateral budding from an
                    original hydra-form developed from a diblastula.</p>
                <p>The hydriform person in its most fully developed state is seen in the colonies of
                    <hi rend="italic">Tubularia.</hi> In such a colony a number of hydriform persons
                    are united like the flowers of ⅛ plant on its branches (whence Allman’s terms
                    hydranth, hydrophyton). Each hydriform person (fig. 35) has an elongated <hi
                    rend="italic">body</hi> with oral and aboral pole. The mouth is placed centrally
                    at the oral pole, which is somewhat enlarged and conical At the apex of the
                    cone, immediately around the mouth, is a circlet of <hi rend="italic">small
                    tentacles</hi>; at the base of the cone is a second circlet of <hi rend="italic"
                    >larger tentacles',</hi> the surface -of the oral cone is termed the <hi

                    Hydra,</hi> fig. 42) the smaller circle of tentacles is wanting; in others,
                    again, the tentacles are irregularly placed and not concentrated into one
                    circlet (fig. 38). We regard the former as the typical condition. In the
                    hydriform persons of the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusoe</hi> (figs. 26 and 27)
                    the vertical axis is much shortened, the hypostome is flat, and the whole body
                    cup-like or hemispherical.</p>
                <p>The tentacles of the hydriform person are sometimes hollow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hydra, Gaτveia nutans,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hydrocorallinoe),</hi> being mere
                    prolongations of the sac-like body; but usually, though the endodermal
                    cell-layer is continued into them, they are solid (2 in fig. 16). Very generally
                    the tentacles of the hydra-form are indefinite in number, but in those belonging
                    to the group of <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusoe</hi> a primary series indicating
                    four radii (perradial) can be distinguished, to which are added four
                    intermediate to these, marking four secondary radii (interradial), whilst eight
                    more placed between the eight of the perradial and interradial series are known
                    as adradial tentacles. The surface of the hydraform may be entirely naked, or
                    encased in a horny tube (perisarc) formed by the ectoderm: this may be confined
                    to the aboral portion of the hydranth and to the common stem which unites the
                    persons of a colony, or it may rise up and form a cup (or hydrotheca) around the
                    oral region of the hydranth (figs. 32 and 33).</p>
                <p>The bodies of all hydriform persons, as well as the tentacles, are excessively
                    contractile, and when hydrothecae are present can be withdrawn into them.</p>
                <p>The ectoderm or outer cell-layer furnishes the protective and contractile tissues
                    of the hydra-form. Very usually it is not more than one or two cells deep, and
                    is separated from the endoderm by a structureless lamella of firm consistence.
                    <hi rend="italic">In. Hydra</hi> large cells of the ectoderm (neuro-muscular
                    cells of Kleinenberg) bound the external surface (fig. 3) and give off
                    horizontal muscular processes which lie side by side on the structureless
                    lamella— forming thus a deep muscular coat, the fibrous elements of which are
                    not independent cells. In larger species some of the fibres may become separated
                    from the tegumentary or superficial cells, and acquire the character of
                    independent nucleated corpuscles <hi rend="italic">(Hydractinia,</hi> Van

                    solid tentacles are essentially tactile organs. Placed in and between the large
                    cells of the ectoderm <hi rend="italic">(Hydra, Cordylophora,</hi> Allman,
                    Kleinenberg, F. E. Schulze) are small nucleated cells which become converted
                    into vesicles containing a three-barbed (figs. 4 and 5) or simple filament
                    (nematocysts). These are frequently grouped on the surface in wart-like
                    processes or “batteries.” Nematocysts also are found in the endoderm; but it is
                    probable that their presence there is due to their having been swallowed.</p>
                <p>The endoderm is usually but one cell deep, and lines the entire cavity of the
                    body starting from the margin of the mouth. In the region of the body proper,
                    and in hollow tentacles, the cells are ciliated (fig. 4). In this region they
                    are concerned in the secretion of digestive fluids and in absorption, and
                    sometimes contain coloured granules (hepatic?). Allman found in <hi
                    rend="italic">Myriothela (Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1875) that the endoderm cells
                    project processes like the pseudopodia of <hi rend="italic">Protozoa,</hi> and
                    suggests that solid food particles are incepted by them. T. J. Parker has
                    published similar observation on <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi> (1880). In the
                    solid tentacles the endodermal cells are greatly modified, forming a kind of
                    skeletal tissue, each cell recalling by its vacuolation and firm cell-wall the
                    characters of vegetable parenchyma (fig. 6). In the stems of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siphoηophora</hi> endoderm cells give origin to muscular processes like those
                    of the ectoderm (Claus). This latter fact has a morphological significance which
                    cannot be too gravely estimated.</p>
                <p>Generative products are not developed by any hydriform persons (excepting the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucernaria?)</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> the sexual process being
                    carried on by a distinct set of buds developed on the sides of hydriform

                    representatives of such persons (sporosacs) (figs. 17 and 18). Even the
                    fresh-water <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi> (fig. 42) does not appear to be an
                    exception to this generalization. The single egg cell of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydra</hi> projects at the breeding season in an ectodermal covering, as a
                    wart, from the lower part of the body. A conical eminence or two nearer the
                    mouth contains the spermatozoa. Each ovarium and each spermarium represents an
                    aborted generative person. According to Kleinenberg the egg-cell and the
                    sperm-cells are both derived from the ectoderm. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lucernarioe</hi> develop internal generative organs (fig. 19) which correspond
                    closely with those of the medusiform persons of the group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scyphomedusoe</hi> (see below), with which they are classified. Both ova and
                    testis are endodermal in origin in <hi rend="italic">Lucernaria</hi> and in the
                    medusiform persons of the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusoe,</hi> whilst they

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Medusiform persons</hi> usually present themselves as

                    become detached or may remain connected with the primary person (fig. 57) to

                    below), or as metameric fission-products of hydra-forms. The typical medusa-form
                    is ,a hemispherical cup (the <hi rend="italic">nectocalyx,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">umbrella,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">disc),</hi> from the centre of
                    which rises up a cylindrical or conical process (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >manubrium,</hi> erroneously <hi rend="italic">ρolypite)</hi> at the summit of
                    which is the mouth (4, 5 in fig. 16). Four perradial (see above for use of this
                    term) tentacle-like lobes very commonly surround the mouth, or numerous small
                    tentacles (fig. 58), whilst the margin of the disc is beset with tentacles four
                    in number, or a multiple of four (sometimes six, or one only, or indefinite).
                    The aboral pole is dome-like, and is never attached except in those forms which
                    take their origin as buds on a hydriform colony when the connexion exists at
                    this point. The tentacles are, as in the hydriform persons, some solid, some
                    hollow; both occur in the same individual.</p>
                <p>The body is not so completely hollowed out as in the hydriform persons. The mouth
                    leads into a straight tube (the stomach) which occupies the axis of the
                    manubrium, and expands at its insertion into the disc. The disc, even when thick
                    and fleshy, is not fully excavated by the enteric cavity. In young forms the
                    cavity does occupy it right up to the margin, but gradually the lumen disappears
                    (fig. 29), leaving a series of canals and a continuous plate of endoderm (fig.
                    7) formed by the coalesced walls of the space (the endoderm-lamella of the
                    Hertwigs, see <hi rend="italic">Organismus der Medusen,</hi> 1878; the

                    >Wiener Denksch.,</hi> 1878). The peripheral portion of the lumen of the
                    original enteric cavity forms the ring-canal, which runs all round the margin of
                    the disc, and is continued into the hollow tentacles. The lumen is further
                    retained at intervals in the form of radiating canals connecting the axial
                    enteric cavity with the ringcanal. These may be perradial, interradial, and

                <p>The medusae are thicker and more fleshy to the touch than are the hydra-forms,
                    and are at the same time transparent. This is entirely due to the enormous
                    development of a structureless substance between ectoderm and endoderm,,
                    corresponding to the “Stutz-lamella” or structureless lamella of the
                    hydra-forms. (See figs. 49 and 51, representing sections of <hi rend="italic"

                    hyaline condition has led to the description of canals and spaces where none
                    exist—the supposed spaces being really occupied by this hyaline substance. F. E.
                    Schulze’s statements as to extra-enteric spaces in <hi rend="italic">Sarsia</hi>
                    are thus explained—and more decidedly the supposed circular and longitudinal
                    canals attributed by some authors to the scyphistoma phase of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discomedusoe.</hi> In the same manner (according to Claus) Allman’s
                    observations on <hi rend="italic">Siephanoscyphus</hi> are reconciled with those
                    of F. E. Schulze on <hi rend="italic">Spongicola—</hi> clearly the same form.
                    <hi rend="italic">Siephanoscyphus</hi> is devoid of either circular or
                    longitudinal canals, and though it has four remarkable ridges on the enteric

                <p>In a large number of medusa-forms the hyaline gelatinous substance is
                    structureless, but in many of the larger <hi rend="italic">Scy-</hi><hi

                <p>The wandering endodermal cells are nutrient in function, and represent so far
                    isolated elements of the enteric canal system.</p>
                <p>The medusiform person is fundamentally adapted to swimming movements. The
                    muscular fibres are mostly transversely striated, and are as a rule outgrowths
                    of super ficial ectoderm cells as in <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi> (fig. 9),
                    (though in some cases distinct cells); they are confined to a sheet spread on
                    the oral face only of the disc or swimming-bell (sometimes called sub-umbrella),
                    to the extensile manubrium and tentacles, and to an inwardly directed flap of
                    the margin of the disc known as the <hi rend="italic">velum ( Ve</hi> in 4 of
                    fig. 16), which is present in those medusae that are not flattened but conical
                    (bell-like). The muscular fibres on the oral face of the disc and on the velum
                    have a circular direction, interrupted in some cases by radial tracts. The
                    direction of the swimming movements is obvious from this arrangement.</p>
                <p>. The velum is not a constant element in the medusa’s disc; it serves to contract
                    the space by which water is expelled from beneath the bell in the act of
                    swimming.</p>
                <p>All fully-developed <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe</hi> possess the velum, but
                    only a few of the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusa? (Charybdcea),</hi> In the
                    former the endoderm plate (vascular lamella) is not continued into it; in the
                    latter vessels of the enteric system are present in it (fig. 21), and, being
                    probably morphologically distinct, it has been here termed the
                    “pseudo-velum.”</p>
                <p>Unlike the hydra-forms, the medusa-forms of <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi>
                    possess in addition to the tentacles highly-developed senseorgans and ganglionic
                    nerve-centres and nerves. The senseorgans appear to be either eye-spots, or else
                    otocysts, or to combine the functions of both. In addition to these are
                    olfactory tracts or pits connected with the preceding. The sense-organs are
                    placed along the margin of the disc (hence called marginal bodies), and are of
                    three kinds:— (1) ocelli—rounded pigment spots, rarely provided with a lens <hi

                    or in the radius of one on the oral surface <hi rend="italic">{Lizzia),</hi>
                    entirely ectodermal in origin; (2) vesiculi or otocysts—formed (as discovered by
                    the Hertwigs, 1878) by an invagination of the ectoderm (fig. 11) containing
                    concretions and hair cells; either open or entirely closed, generally numerous,
                    and placed <hi rend="italic">between</hi> tentacles, sometimes at the bases of

                    tentaculocysts—which are reduced and modified tentacles; into them alone of the
                    three kinds of mar ginal bodies do the endoderm and, in the more complex, the
                    enteric canal system enter (figs. 12, 13, and 30). The endodermal sac forms the
                    axis of the tentaculocyst, its cells secrete crystalline concretions, and it
                    functions as an otocyst; pigment spots, which may have cornea, lens, and retina
                    well developed, are formed sometimes to the number of six <hi rend="italic"

                    existence of such fibres and ganglion cells in the region of the circular
                    muscular zone on the oral face of the disc of <hi rend="italic">Aurelia,</hi>
                    immediately beneath the flattened epithelium of the ectoderm. Professor Claus of

                    Quallen der Adria,” 187,8) similar nerve-cells and fibres in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chry-sαora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Charybdaea.</hi> Professor Schäfer failed
                    to ascertain satisfactorily the origin and termination of the fibres, which
                    appear, however, to originate in superficial ecto dermal cells
                    (“sense-epithelium”) in the neighbourhood of the tentaculocysts and in the cells
                    of those organs, and to terminate without any plexiform connexion with one
                    another in the muscular fibres. Eimer has described very abundant and
                    excessively fine fibres, often moniliform, which extend from epithelial cells in
                    the neighbourhood of tentaculocysts and form a network traversing the gelatinous
                    substance of the disc in every direction. This observation, though supported by
                    the fact that such fibres are indicated by the extended experimental
                    investigation of Eimer and of Romanes (Eimer, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi

                    not confirmed by other observers, and the fibres described are regarded as
                    skeletal tissue. If Eimer’s fibres do not exist, the muscular tissue of the
                    medusae must be regarded as acting to a large extent independently of
                    nerve-control; and this is borne out by Claus’s observation of the absence of
                    sense-organs and nerve-fibres from the swimming-bells of the <hi rend="italic"

                    superior portion by the insertion of the velum. The difference in the form of
                    the nervous system has led Eimer to propose the names <hi rend="italic"

                <p>A two-cell-layered sac-like form, with mouth and with or without tentacles, was
                    the common ancestor of <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa, Anthozoa,</hi> and Sponges.
                    The particular form which the proximate ancestor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrozoa</hi> took (1 in fig. 16) is most nearly exhibited at the present day
                    in <hi rend="italic">Lucernaria</hi> and in the scyphistoma larva (hydra-tuba)
                    of <hi rend="italic">Discomedusae.</hi> It was a hemispherical cup-like polyp
                    with tentacles in multiples of four, with four lobes to the wide enteric
                    chamber. This polyp, after passing a portion of its life fixed by the aboral
                    pole, loosened itself and swam fιeely by the contractions of the circular
                    muscular fibres of its hypostome (sub-umbrella), and developed its ovaria and
                    spermaria on the inner walls of the enteric chamber. This ancestor possessed,
                    like its descendants, a very marked power of multiplication, either by buds or
                    by detached fragments of its body. Accordingly it acquired definitely the
                    character of multiplying by bud-formation during the earlier period of its life;
                    each of the buds so formed completed in the course of time its growth into a
                    free swimming person. We must suppose that the peculiarities of the two phases
                    of development became more and more distinctly developed, the earlier budding
                    phase exhibiting a more elongated form and simple enteric cavity (hydra-form),
                    which subsequently <pb break="no"

                    (development of the individual) into the umbrella or disc-like form, with
                    coalesced enteric walls and radial and circular surviving spaces (medusa-form).
                    And now the ancestry took two distinct lines, which have given rise respectively
                    to the two great groups into which the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> are
                    divisible—the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusoe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydromedusoe.</hi> In the one set the hydriform persons of a colony, instead of
                    each becoming metamorphosed into a medusiform person, proceeded each to break up
                    into a series of transverse divisions; each division became a medusiform person,
                    and was liberated in its turn as a free swimming organism (figs. 26 and 27). We
                    must suppose that this process began historically by the outgrowth of new
                    tentacles around the point where the disc of a person fully transformed from the
                    hydriform to the medusiform phase was loosened in its attachment and about to
                    separate from the colony. The “hastening of events,” a well-known feature of
                    organic growth-sequences, would complete the development of the newly sprouting
                    person before the loosened medusa had got well away, and so on with a third,
                    fourth, and even with twenty such successive buds. The separation of the adult
                    form from its fixed larva by fission has been justly compared by Louis Agassiz
                    to the separation of the <hi rend="italic">Comatula</hi> from its pentacrinoid
                    larval stalk. If the stalk could only produce new <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comatuloe,</hi> the analogy would be complete. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lucernaria</hi> is in the same way comparable with the stalked crinoids, being
                    an adult form which retains the characters exhibited by the immature phases of
                    its congeners.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusoe</hi> do not, however, all exhibit a hydriform

                    but becomes at once a single medusa, the hydriform phase of the ontogeny being
                    altogether omitted. Certain peculiarities of the medusa’s structure, above all
                    the possession of gastral filaments (solid filaments like tentacles projecting
                    in four interradial groups near the genitalia into the enteric cavity), serve to

                <p>The second line of descent which has given rise to those <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrozoa</hi> known as <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe</hi> not only acquired at
                    the start a different mode of producing medusiform persons, but the medusiform
                    persons acquired characters differing from those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scyphomedusoe</hi> in important (but not fundamental) features. The larval
                    stage in this series developed the property of budding to a very great degree,
                    so as often to form fixed tree-like colonies of considerable size. Then the
                    transformation of the identical colonyforming persons into free-swimming persons
                    was finally and definitively abandoned, and only a late-appearing set of buds
                    proceeded to complete the typical changes and to become medusae. The
                    earlier-produced buds were thus arrested in development, and became specially
                    modified for the purposes of a fixed life as members of a colony. Thus they
                    acquired the elongate form and the sporadic position of the tentacles which we
                    see in some hydriform persons of the <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe</hi> group
                    (figs. 38 and 40), and were adapted to nutrition solely (hence the term
                    trophosome applied by Allman to such colonies). The characters of the mature
                    generative person, with its power of detachment and free locomotion, being
                    confined to the later buds borne on the sides of the hydriform persons or on
                    special portions of the colony, we find that the former became more and more
                    specialized as <hi rend="italic">sexual</hi> medusiform persons in proportion as
                    the latter became specialized as <hi rend="italic">asexual</hi> hydriform
                    persons, and thus it is that we have the remarkable phenomenon of hydriform
                    colonies, developed from the eggs of medusae, producing as it were crops of
                    medusae (figs. 34 and 37) which detach themselves and swim away to deposit their
                    eggs (alternation of generations). The <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe</hi> never
                    produce medusae by strobilation or transverse division of a hydriform person,
                    although in rare cases the cicatrix left by a detached medusa-bud has been
                    observed to sprout and produce a hydriform person. Neither medusiform nor
                    hydriform persons of the <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe</hi> series ever have
                    gastral filaments (unless they are represented by the “villi” of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphonophora</hi> described by Huxley, <hi rend="italic">Oceanic

                    about in some of the descendants of these forms. The condition which we have so
                    far noted is perpetuated at the present day in <hi rend="italic">Bougainvillia
                    (Budendrium), Campanularia,</hi> and a vast number of the so-called hydroid
                    polyps; others have undergone further adaptational changes. We have to notice at
                    least four important additional modifications independent of one another.</p>

                <p>(2.) The medusiform persons being early produced did not separate themselves from
                    the colony, but the whole colony became free (if it ever were fixed), the
                    medusiform persons carrying the hydriform persons away with them. Thus the
                    highly differentiated swimming and floating colonies of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siphonophora</hi> originated.</p>
                <p>(3.) The medusiform persons ceased to detach themselves from the fixed hydriform
                    persons or colonies, and developed the ova and sperm within themselves, whilst
                    still small in size and attached to the hydriform stock. Having once abandoned
                    the detached, free-swimming life, the medusae underwent in different genera a
                    varying amount of degeneration and atrophy, of which we have in existence all
                    possible degrees, leading from the fixed “phanerocodonic gonophors” (Allman,
                    bell-like genital buds) of many <hi rend="italic">Siphonophora</hi> through the
                    “adelocodonic gonophors” (genital buds with the bell no longer open but closed
                    by the union of the margins of the disc) of <hi rend="italic">Cordylophora</hi>
                    to the sporosacs of <hi rend="italic">Hydractinia,</hi> and even to the simple
                    genital warts of the little degenerate <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">viridis</hi> of fresh waters (see fig. 17, and explanation). By
                    this process a large num ber of <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusas</hi> (figs. 35,
                    38, 39, 40, and 42) have lost all evidence of the real characters of their
                    medusa-forms, just as others have suppressed the evidence of their hydra-forms
                    by direct development from the egg; and inasmuch as both these processes take
                    place in genera having the closest affinity with genera in which both hydra-form
                    and medusa-form are fully preserved, it is not possible to erect groups similar
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Haplomorpha</hi> of Carus or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monopsea</hi> of Allman for their reception. The difficulty of classification
                    is, however, rendered very great, fora double system becomes necessary, which
                    shall deal with the characters of hydriform and medusiform persons in parallel
                    equivalent series. The difficulty is considerably enhanced when we find that
                    identical medusa-forms may spring from unlike hydra-forms, and, conversely, that
                    closely allied hydra-forms may give rise to very different medusa-forms. The
                    character first noticed by Rapp as distinguishing the hydroid polyps from the
                    coral-polyps, namely, that of developing their genitalia as external bodies <hi
                    rend="italic">(Exoarii)</hi> instead of internally <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Endoarii),</hi> is seen by the considerations just adduced to be fallacious.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusae,</hi> it is true, often (not always) develop
                    their generative products from the ectoderm, and the genitalia frequently
                    project as ridges and discharge themselves directly to the exterior in this
                    division. The <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusas</hi> contrast in this respect with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusa?</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anthozoa,</hi>
                    which develop their genitalia from the endoderm, and are (to use Rapp’s terms)
                    <hi rend="italic">Endoarii</hi> whilst the former are <hi rend="italic"
                    >ExoarU.</hi> But the bodies mistaken for external generative organs by Rapp and
                    other early observers in many hydroids, and in <hi rend="italic">Hydra</hi>
                    itself, are aborted degenerate medusae.</p>
                <p>(4.) A further set of changes, which have affected the original hydriform
                    colonies and their medusa-buds so as to produce new complications of structure
                    among the <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusas,</hi> are summed up under the head of
                    “polymorphism.” The differentiation of hydriform and medusiform persons is a
                    case of dimorphism; a further distribution of functions, with corresponding
                    modification of form, gives us “polymorphism.” Polymorphism is unknown in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusa?,</hi> and it is chiefly confined to two groups
                    of <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusae</hi> (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrocorallinas</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Siphonophora).</hi> In the
                    hydriform colonies of <hi rend="italic">Hydractinia</hi> (one of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gymηoblastea-Aηthome-</hi><hi rend="italic">dusoe)</hi> the outer
                    hydriform persons of the colony (fig. 39) differ in form from the rest, and have
                    wart-like tentacles. In the same genus, and also in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calyptoblastea,</hi> the hydriform persons which are destined especially to
                    give origin to medusa-buds are devoid of tentacles and mouth, and are known as
                    blastostyles (Allman), (fig. 43). In <hi rend="italic">Hydro-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">corallinoe</hi> (fig. 53) elongated hydriform persons
                    (dactylozooids) with no mouth and sporadic tentacles are set in series around a
                    central short mouth-bearing person (gastrozooids) forming the “cyclo-systems” of
                    Mr Moseley (figs. 52 and 55). In the <hi rend="italic">Siphonophora,</hi> in
                    addition to nutritive (hydriform) persons and generative (medusiform) persons,
                    there may be rows of swimming-bells (medusae devoid of mouth and of genitalia),
                    covering-pieces (flattened medusae), and tentacle-bearers (hydriforan persons
                    with one long highly-developed tentacle), (see figs. 56 and 57).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hypothesis of the Individuation of Organs.—</hi> The building
                    up of complex individualities, such as a hydrozoon colony, a flowering plant, or
                    a segmented worm or arthropod—in any one of which a number of common units are
                    repeated, but with varied form and function in each part of the compound body—is
                    generally admitted to be explicable in two ways, and which of the two
                    explanations may be adopted in any one case must depend on the ultimate
                    inference from a wide series of observations. The first hypothesis, which
                    undoubtedly applies to the ordinary hydriform colonies of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrozoa,</hi> to the segments of <hi rend="italic">Tcenia,</hi> and to plants
                    formed by the repetition of phyllomes, is that an original unit like those which
                    constitute the composite organism has freely budded, and repeated its own
                    structure in the well-marked units which remain conjoined to form an aborescent
                    or linear aggregate. This is “eumerogenesis,” and such aggregates may be termed
                    eumeristic. By a division of labour and consequent modification of form among
                    the units of a eumeristic aggregate, such an aggregate may (in the course of
                    phylogeny) acquire varied shape and definite grouping of its constituent units,
                    and a high specialization as an individual. The high degree of individuation
                    which may be thus attained is due to the more or less complete synthesis of a
                    eumeristic colony. The more highly individuated Chaetopods and Arthropods are
                    synthesized linear colonies. The cyclo-systems of the <hi rend="italic">Hydro·
                    corallinae</hi> are undoubted examples of synthesized colonies. The second
                    hypothesis is one which is applicable to cases which, in the absence of special
                    evidence to the contrary, might be regarded as highly synthesized colonies.
                    According to this second hypothesis, such highly individuated composite
                    organisms have not (in their phylogeny) passed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0570-0555"/> through a eumeristic phase in which the units
                    were well developed and alike, but the tendency to bud-formation (whether
                    lateral, linear, or radial) has all along acted concurrently with a powerful
                    synthetic tendency, so that new units have from the first made but a gradual and
                    disguised appearance. This is “dysmerogenesis,” and such aggregates as exhibit
                    it may be called dysmeristic. In dysmeristic forms the individuality of the
                    primary unit dominates from the first, and the merogenesis (segmentation or
                    bud-formation) can only show itself by partially here and more completely there
                    compelling (as it were) the organs or regions of the body of the primary unit to
                    assume the form of new units. The arms of star-fishes are, when we consider them
                    as derived from the antimera of a Holothurian, explained as examples of
                    dysmerogenesis. So, too, the series of segments constituting a leech, and
                    probably also the segments of a vertebrate. Eumerogenesis and dysmerogenesis are
                    only variations of one process, merogenesis, and no sharp line can be drawn
                    between them. Individuation may appear at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> period in
                    the phylogeny of a eumeristic aggregate and synthesize its units. On the other
                    hand, individuation is more or less completely dominant <hi rend="italic"
                    >throughout</hi> the history of a dysmeristic aggregate, and is gradually broken
                    down as a more and more complete analysis of the primary unit into new units is
                    effected. It will be observed, however, that in dysmerogenesis, the <hi
                    rend="italic">form</hi> which individuation tends to preserve is that of the
                    primary unit (notably the case in leeches as compared with the ameristic
                    flukes), whereas when we have eumerogenesis followed by synthesis the resulting
                    form-individuality is something absolutely new. Thus, using the terms
                    eumeroraorph and dysmeromorph, we have—(1) synthesized eumeromorph simulates
                    normal dysmeromorph; (2) analysized dysmeromorph simulates normal
                    eumeromorph.</p>
                <p>Whether the fixed hydriform colonies of the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa,</hi> with
                    their more or less complete medusiform buds, and further, the floating colonies
                    of <hi rend="italic">Siphonophora,</hi> with their polymorphous units, are to be
                    regarded as synthesized eumeromorphs or as dysmeromorphs, more or less analysed,
                    is perhaps still open to discussion. The former view (that adopted here) is that
                    held by Allman <hi rend="italic">(Monograph of the Tubulariaη Hydroids,</hi>
                    1874), by Leuckart (1851), by Gegenbaur <hi rend="italic">(Grundriss,</hi>
                    1874), by Claus <hi rend="italic">(Grundzüge der Zoologie,</hi> 1876), and by
                    the Hertwigs <hi rend="italic">(Organismus der Medusen,</hi> 1878). On the other
                    hand, Huxley <hi rend="italic">(Oceanic Hydrozoa,</hi> 1856), formerly Gegenbaur
                    <hi rend="italic">(Zur Lehre der Generationswechsel,</hi> 1854), and, more
                    recently, Ed. Van Beneden (“De la distinction originelle du testicule et de

                    rend="italic">Boy. Belg.,</hi> 1874) have held that the medusiform person is a
                    generative wart which has gradually assumed the characters of a bud, and that
                    the various phases presented by it in different genera are so many more or less
                    successful strivings after complete assumption of the hydra-form (from which the
                    medusa-form is thus secondarily derived). Similarly the variously modified units
                    of the siphonophorous colony have been regarded as the organs of a parent unit
                    which have each more or less completely acquired the form of that parent unit,
                    or, in other words, the colonies in question have been held to be dysmeromorphs.

                    of structure of the medusae of the Scypho-medusan and Hydromedusan groups, and,
                    further, the mode of development of the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusoe</hi>
                    from the scyphistoma and the relations of the generative products to the enteric
                    cavity, combine to render the view that the polymorphous and dimorphous colonies
                    of <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> are synthesized eumeromorphs more probable,
                    in the judgment of the present writer, than that which would explain them as
                    dysmeromorphs.</p>
                <p>The term “merogenesis,” and its subordinate terms, “eumerogenesis,
                    dysmerogenesis,” &amp;c., are applicable to units of the first order, namely,

                    celldivision is an example of eumerogenesis; free-formation of nuclei, as in the
                    fertilized ovum of Arthropods, is dysmerogenesis. A syncytium is usually a
                    synthesized eumeromorph, but may be a dysmeromorph.</p>

                <p>The following is a brief summary of the chief characters of the larger divisions
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa :—</hi></p>
                <p>Sub-class I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Scyphomedusae.</hi> —These are <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrozoa</hi> which in the adult condition always have four or
                    eight interradial groups of gastral filaments (“pha-cellae” of Haeckel) (figs.
                    16 (6), 23,and 26). Thegeni-talia (ovaria and spermaria) are developed from
                    endoderm, and are always interradial (in the four radii formed after the first
                    four). The hydra-form is not a “hydroid,” but a short polyp with broad
                    hypostome—the “scyphistoma,’’which gives rise to medusa-forms by transverse
                    fission (strobilation), or itself develops genitalia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lucernariae).</hi> Combined visual and auditory organs in the form of modified
                    tentacles (tentaculocysts) to the number of four, eight, or more occur on the
                    edge of the disc (except in <hi rend="italic">Lucernariae,</hi> where they are
                    represented by the “colleto-cystophors”). The medusa-form in some cases develops
                    from the egg without the intermediate scyphistoma-stage <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pelagia,</hi><hi rend="italic">CharybdoeaT).</hi> The edge of its disc is
                    provided with lappets, which cover the sensorial tentaculocysts (hence <hi
                    rend="italic">Steganophthalmia</hi> of Forbes), and is not provided with a velum
                    (hence <hi rend="italic">“Acraspeda</hi>” of Gegenbaur), excepting the
                    rudimentary velum of <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> (fig. 31) and the
                    well-developed vascular velum (pseudo-velum) of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charybdoea</hi> (fig. 21). There is no continuous marginal nerve-ring (except
                    in <hi rend="italic">Charybdoea),</hi> but several separate marginal nerve
                    centres (hence <hi rend="italic">Toponeura</hi> of Eimer). The <pb break="no"

                    point to distinctions which are not valid. In 1853 Kolliker used the <hi

                    for the <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusae</hi> alone, an illegitimate limitation
                    of the term which was followed by Louis Agassiz in 1860. Nicholson has used the
                    term in the reverse sense for a heterogeneous assemblage of those medusae not
                    classified by Huxley as <hi rend="italic">Lucernaridoe,</hi> nor as yet
                    recognized as derived from hydroid trophosomes. This use of the term adds to the
                    existing confusion, and renders its abandonment necessary. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">Discomedusae</hi> was used for the <hi rend="italic"

                    to them alone, which is objectionable, since it belongs as justly to the <hi

                    complementary term <hi rend="italic">Gymnophthalmia</hi> is inaccurate.
                    Similarly the terms <hi rend="italic">Acraspeda</hi> and its complement <hi
                    rend="italic">Graspcdota</hi> are inacceptable. Eimer has proposed to use the

                    for the two divisions—but <hi rend="italic">Charybdoea</hi> appears to break
                    down this division as so many others. The old term <hi rend="italic"

                    has sometimes been described in them is a product of erroneous observation. A
                    very few genera and species of this order are known. They may be justly called
                    the coenotype of the medusae (James Clark), and their relationship to the free

                    have eight tentaculocysts, four perradial, four interradial, and sometimes

                    central region of the enteric cavity, which is produced into a corresponding

                    mistaken for independent persons. The central enteric chamber is continued
                    through the disc by a complicated often reticulate system of radiating canals,
                    which excavate the endoderm lamella.</p>

                    >Chrysaora,</hi> up to the compl e-tion of the scyphistoma), a
                    single-cell-layered blastula develops which forms a diblastula by invagination
                    (fig. 25, A, B, C). The orifice of invagination closes up, and the ciliated
                    “planula” (as this stage used to be termed in all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coelentera),</hi> after swimming around for a time, fixes itself, probably by
                    the blastoporal pole. The true mouth then forms by inruption at the opposite
                    pole. Two tentacles now grow out near the mouth opposite to one another (fig.
                    25, D), and are followed by two more (fig. 26), these indicating the four
                    primary radii of the body which pass through the angles of the foursided mouth,
                    and are termed <hi rend="italic">perradial.</hi> Meanwhile the aboral pole
                    narrows and forms a distinct stalk, which in <hi rend="italic">Chrysaora</hi>
                    secretes a horny perisarc (fig. 25, <pb break="no"

                    or secondary radii, now appear between the first four, and are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">interradial.</hi> At the same time four longitudinal ridges grow
                    forward on the wall of the enteric cavity (fig. 26). These interradial ridges
                    have sometimes been erroneously described as containing each a longitudinal
                    canal connected with a circular canal at the base of the tentacles. They are in
                    reality solid, as is the margin of the hypostome from which the tentacles
                    spring. It is in connexion with these four ridges that the gastral filaments
                    will subsequently appear, as also the genital organs either along their middle
                    line or adradially to them. The ridges correspond to the mesenteries of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthozoa.</hi> Eight additional tentacles placed one on each side
                    of the perradial tentacles (or of the interradial, according as we may choose to
                    regard the matter) next appear, and are distinguished as <hi rend="italic"
                    >αdradial.</hi> All the tentacles reaching an equal size, we obtain the
                    appearance seen in fig. 26, when the young scyphistoma is looked at from above.
                    Looked at from the side, with its wide hypostome and short vertical axis, the
                    scyphistoma differs widely from an ordinary hydra-form, and approaches the
                    medusa-form, to which its four longitudinal gastral ridges further assimilate
                    it. The little creature is now about an eighth of an inch in height; in other
                    genera, but not in <hi rend="italic">Chrysaora,</hi> it may now multiply by the
                    production of a few buds from its fixed basal disc. After nourishing itself for
                    a period, and increasing to four or five times the size just noted, the vertical
                    axis elongates and a series of transverse constrictions appear on the surface,
                    marking off the body of the scyphistoma into a series of discs (figs. 26 and
                    27), each of which by the development of tentacles and completion of the
                    constriction will become a separate medusa (in its young state called “ephyra
                    ”). The tentacles of the <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> and the structure of the
                    margin of its hypostome are very different from those of the scyphistoma. They
                    are exhibited in their earliest condition (when the Λwe‰-medusa is first
                    liberated from its attachment and is an ephyra) in fig. 26, E, F. The margin of
                    the hypostome is drawn out into eight arms (which are not to be confused with
                    tentacles); the end of each arm is bifid, carrying a pair of lappets—the
                    marginal lappets which persist in the adult (see figs. 30 and 31). Between the
                    lappets is placed a short and peculiar tentacle, the tentaculocyst or
                    sense-organ. The eight arms of the disc and their tentaculocysts are perradial
                    and interradial. As the organism grows, a set of eight adradial tentacles appear
                    in the notches between the eight arms, but never attain any relatively large
                    size in <hi rend="italic">Aurelia.</hi> The asteroid arm-bearing character of
                    the margin of the disc is soon obliterated by the relative growth of the
                    intermediate adradial areas, which become quite filled up, so that in the adult
                    the tentaculocyst is carried in a notch instead of on a prominence, and is
                    concealed by the two lappets (figs. 28 and 30). The margin of the disc between
                    adjacent pairs of lappets gives rise to a fold which grows inwards (toward the
                    mouth) during an early stage (fig. 31), and numerous small tentacles (the
                    fringe) appear along the margin of the disc, which soon equal in size the first
                    adradial tentacle. The ingrowing fold is the velum or “pseudo-velum,” and never
                    increases in size, so that in the adult it is not observ able. The tentacles
                    also remain very small and fine in <hi rend="italic">Aurelia,</hi> forming a
                    continuous fringe along the edge of the disc, interrupted only by the eight
                    notches for the tentaculocysts (fig. 29),</p>
                <p>The sixteen tentacles of the scyphistoma are necessarily attached to the most
                    anterior of the pile of medusae; they atrophy, but to what extent they may be
                    metamorphosed to form the parts of the ephyra or young medusa has not been
                    determined. The scyphistoma, having given rise to its pile of ephyrae, may (in
                    some genera, <hi rend="italic">AureliaX)</hi> redevelop its own kind of
                    tentacles below the constriction marking off the last ephyra. Hence scyphistoma
                    tentacles appear sometimes at the top and sometimes at the bottom <pb break="no"

                    the mode of development of the ephyrae.</p>
                <p>Whilst changes are going on in the configuration of the margin of the disc of an
                    ephyra on its way to the perfect form of the adult <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aurelia,</hi> the enteric cavity has also undergone most important changes.
                    Foremost in importance is the development of a single gastral filament on each
                    of the four gastral ridges which necessarily are present in the transverse slice
                    (so to call it) of a scyphistoma, which becomes an ephyra (fig. 26). These
                    rapidly increase in number as the ephyra grows. Further, the enteric cavity at
                    first follows the outline of the ephyra, sending a process into each arm, but
                    then by adhesion of its walls is converted into a four-lobed central chamber, a
                    marginal canal, and an endoderm lamella. A system of canals, the arrangement of
                    which is seen in figs. 29 and 31, subsequently opens out again certain lines and
                    tracts of the conjoined endoderm walls.</p>
                <p>In the adult <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> we find the mouth surrounded by four
                    large arm-like ρerradial processes (figs. 25 and 29) (not tentacles), and
                    leading through a short manubrium into a flattened four-lobed chamber, the lobes
                    being interradial, and having on their oral floor numerous gastral filaments
                    (rich in thread cells) (6 in fig. 16). Each pouch or lobe gives off a canal,
                    which runs towards the circular canal at the margin of the disc, but breaks up
                    into three or four secondary canals on its way. Between the pouches come off
                    eight other “radiating” canals (adradial), which do not branch, but go straight
                    to the circular canal.</p>
                <p>The oral floor of the concavity of each lobe of the enteric cavity is occupied by
                    a horse-shoe-shaped frill (fig. 29, <hi rend="italic">ov),</hi> either testis or
                    ovary (the sexes being in separate individuals). The open arms of the horse-shoe
                    are turned towards the centre of the disc, and the folds of the genital frill
                    are so deep as to show themselves on the outer ectodermal wall of the disc.
                    Here, however, there is a very remarkable arrangement, which has rarely, if
                    ever, been correctly described and figured in our common <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aurelia.</hi> The gelatinous substance of the disc is hollowed out on that part
                    of the oral face corresponding to the position of the genital frills, so as to
                    form four separate extensive pits or chambers. Each of these sub-genital pits
                    has in <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> a small round opening on the oral face of
                    the disc (fig. 28, GP), but is otherwise entirely closed, having no
                    communication with the genital tissues, from which it is separated by a delicate
                    layer of ectoderm (6 in fig. 16). The pits probably serve to admit water for
                    respiratory purposes into close proximity with the genital tissues.</p>
                <p>The whole enteric surface, including canals, is ciliated, whilst the ectoderm is
                    not ciliated, but provided with groups of nematocysts.</p>
                <p>The tentaculocyst in the adult <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> is relatively an
                    extremely minute body, completely hidden by the two large marginal lappets (fig.
                    30, T). Above it (that is, on the aboral surface, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aurelia</hi> swims) is a deep pit (A), Schafer’s fovea nervosa superior, sunk
                    in a sort of bridge which connects the two lappets and overhangs the
                    tentaculocyst. A similar pit (the fovea inferior) exists on the oral surface.
                    These have been recognized by Claus, Eimer, and the Hertwigs as olfactory
                    organs. The tentaculocyst is seen in section in fig. 30 (right-hand figure),
                    which exhibits its central cavity continuous with the enteric cavity, its
                    ectodermal pigment spot (eye), and its endodermal mass of concretions (auditory
                    organ).</p>
                <p>The chief muscular mass of <hi rend="italic">Aurelia,</hi> except that of the
                    oral arms, is a circular zone on the oral face of the disc. The muscular fibres
                    are not distinct cells, but transversely-striated processes of the epidermic
                    cells (epidermo-muscular cells) (fig. 9). In the “arms” of other medusae, and
                    presumably of <hi rend="italic">Aurelia,</hi> the muscular fibre is formed by
                    independent nucleated cells (fig. 9).</p>
                <p>The nerve-epithelium from the olfactory pits of <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> is
                    drawn in fig. 14. Starting from this and from the cells of the tentaculocysts
                    are nerve-fibres, which spread themselves on the surface of the circular
                    muscular zone in the neighbourhood of the tentaculocysts, and these are
                    connected each and separately with large isolated nerve-ganglion cells (fig.
                    15). The nerve-fibre is continued beyond the cell, and in some instances has
                    been traced into a broadened expansion lying on a muscular fibre (Schäfer). The
                    nerveganglion cells lie very superficially immediately below the flat epithelium
                    of the body surface and between it and its muscular processes.</p>
                <p>Tbe ova and spermatozoa of <hi rend="italic">Aurelia</hi> develop in the genital
                    frills from endoderm cells in separate individuals. They pass to the exterior

                    perradial gastrocanal pouches. The lamelliform genital glands hang freely in
                    these pouches. At the edge of the umbrella are four interradial lappet-like
                    prolongations of the gelatinous substance of the disc, which support each a long
                    tentacle (fig. 20). The nerve-ring is complete, like that of the <hi

                    but always ocelli at the base of the tentacles. The latter are usually four or
                    six, corresponding to the same number of simple radial enteric canals, but may
                    be more numerous or reduced to one or to two; rarely they are branched <hi

                    divided into eight adradial groups by the perradial longitudinal muscles.</p>
                <p>This is a very well defined group, since the <hi rend="italic">Gymηοblastea</hi>
                    of Allman, based on the characters of the hydriform persons—also known as <hi

                    persons are given in the cuts (figs. 34 to 42). The greatest range in the amount
                    of degeneration of the medusiform persons is seen even in genera of the same
                    family— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Turris</hi> and <hi

                    correspond on the whole to the medusa-forms of this order.</p>

                    which forms a cup-like protection (hydrotheca) to the tentacle-crown, and which
                    also encloses the group of medusa-buds in peculiar horny cases (gonangia). The

                    radial canals of the disc (not in the manubrium), and stand out as groups of
                    wart-like processes on the sub-umbrellar surface (fig. 43). Their mode of
                    discharge is uncertain.</p>

                    The calyptoblastic hydroid <hi rend="italic">Leptoscyphus,</hi> which, according
                    to Allman, gives rise to a 2λ'zziα-like medusa <hi rend="italic">(Antho∙</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rnedusae),</hi> is the only recorded exception to this
                    correspondence. The <hi rend="italic">Aequoridae</hi> and other medusae of
                    similar structure have not been traced into connexion with any hydriform
                    trophosome, but we are not justified therefore in concluding that they develop
                    directly from the egg without hydriform phase. The chief point distinguishing
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lcptomedusae</hi> as a lot from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthomedusae</hi> is the development of the generative bodies in the radial
                    canals. This position is similar to that occupied by the same organs in <hi
                    rend="italic">Trachomedusae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scyphomedusas.</hi>
                    Allman, however, considers the genital glands of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lcptomedusae,</hi> not as mere glands like those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aurelia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Charybdoea,</hi> but as a series of buds—a
                    generation of aborted medusae or sporosacs. In consequence he terms the medusa
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Lcptomedusae</hi> a blastocheme (or bud-producer), as
                    distinguished from a gonocheme (or genital-producer). In support of this
                    view,</p>
                <p>Allman <hi rend="italic">(Monograph,</hi> 1874) adduces the various remarkable
                    cases of production of buds by medusae which have been recorded (fig. 44, 45,
                    46), and, further, the very striking similarity between the structure of a lobe
                    of the genital gland of <hi rend="italic">Obelia</hi> and a sporosae such as we
                    find in <hi rend="italic">Hydractinia.</hi> It seems necessary to accept
                    Allman’s view on this matter, unless we are prepared to abandon the homology of
                    sporosacs with medusae in the case of hydriform persons.</p>
                <p>The colonies of hydriform persons of the present group differ <hi rend="italic"

                    raised on a pedicel or stalk. The medusiform persons sometimes remain abortive

                <p>The two orders <hi rend="italic">Trachomedusae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narcomedusae</hi> are established by Haeckel in his new “system” for the

                    Allman as <hi rend="italic">Monopsea.</hi> These latter names have reference to
                    the fact that no hydriform phase is <hi rend="italic">known</hi> to occur in the
                    life-history of these organisms, a fact which is not peculiar to them, and, if
                    it should prove to be not universal amongst them, would by no means invalidate
                    their claim to a distinct position on the grounds afforded by the characters
                    above given. They are remarkable for a certain hardness and stiffness of the
                    gelatinous substance of the disc, or at any rate of the cellular axis of the
                    tentacles, on accout of which the orders are contrasted by Haeckel as <hi

                    high degree of development, both in coarser and histological differentiation. At
                    one time it was supposed, in accordance with Haeckel’s observations, that <hi

                    in cyclosystems of greater or less definiteness, or in distinct rows (fig. 55).
                    The position oι these two kinds of hydriform persons is marked by definite

                    >Velella)</hi> or hydriform persons and sterile medusiform persons are united,
                    under many special modifications of form, to constitute floating colonies of
                    very definite shape and constitution. In addition to these are developed
                    medusiform sexual persons which usually are sporosacs and only exceptionally
                    attain full development so as to be liberated from the colony as free-swimming
                    medusae <hi rend="italic">{Velella,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"

                    medusiform persons, where sufficiently developed, exhibit the velum
                    characteristic of <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe-,</hi> the larger mouth-bearing
                    nydriform persons, which are sometimes the only representatives of their kind,
                    are remarkable for differentiation into four regions,— a proboscis, a stomach, a
                    basal ring, and a short stalk on which the <hi rend="italic">single</hi>
                    tentacle of great length is situated (fig. 56, <hi rend="italic">f).</hi> In the
                    suborder <hi rend="italic">Physophoridoe</hi> (fig. 57, C) the persons are
                    united by a short or long and spiral stem, terminated at one end by a flask-like
                    air-sac (pneumatocyst); below the air-sac a biserial or multiserial range of
                    swimming-bells (nectocalyces = medusae with suppression of manubrium, tentacles,
                    and sense-organs) are placed. Covering pieces (hydrophyllia, reduced medusae)
                    and dactylozooids are affixed to the succeeding region of the stem, and
                    alternate in definite order with the mouth-bearing hydriform persons (polyps or
                    nutritive persons) and generative medusiform persons. In the sub-order <hi
                    rend="italic">Physalidoe</hi> the stem is converted into an air-sac, enormously
                    enlarged, and the nectocalyces and hydrophyllia are absent. In the sub-order <hi
                    rend="italic">Calycophoridoe</hi> the air-sac is not developed, the nectocalyces
                    are in a biserial group, or reduced to two or to one. Dactylozooids are wanting.
                    The modified persons (appendages, Huxley) arise from the stem in groups, and can
                    be withdrawn into the cavity of a swimming-bell (fig. 57, B).</p>
                <p>Each group consists of a nutritive person, with long tentacle, of generative
                    medusoids, and usually also an umbrellashaped or funnel-like covering piece. The
                    latter separate in some <hi rend="italic">Dijjhyidoe,</hi> and lead an
                    independent life as <hi rend="italic">Eudoxioe.</hi></p>
                <p>In the suborder <hi rend="italic">Discoidoe</hi> the stem is converted into a
                    flattened disc with a system of canalicular cavities. Above this lies the air
                    sac, a flattened reservoir of cartilaginous consistence. The hydriform persons
                    depend from the disc, centrally a large nutritive person surrounded by smaller
                    similar persons carrying at their bases the generative medusoids -, near the
                    edge of the disc are dactylozooids. The medusoids develop into complete
                    medusiform persons, and develop the genital products after liberation from the
                    colony, when they are known as <hi rend="italic">Chrysomitra.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Siphοnοphοraaλcme,</hi> amongst the colonies formed by <hi
                    rend="italic">Ηydrο~οa,</hi> exhibit a high degree of division of labour and
                    consequent individuation. The mode of origin of such colonies has been discussed
                    above. The locomotive habit, as contrasted with the sessile habit of other
                    colonies, is no doubt correlated with the sharply defined individuality which
                    they attain (compare <hi rend="italic">Cristatclla</hi> among <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pοlyzοa). Velella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Physalia</hi> are occasionally
                    seen on the southern and western shores of England, but as a rule the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphonophora</hi> are met with only in the open ocean and in the
                    Mediterranean. By some authorities the <hi rend="italic">Siphonophora</hi> are
                    assigned a distinct position among the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa,</hi> side by
                    side with the <hi rend="italic">Hydromedusoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scyphomcdusoe</hi>; their interpretation as floating colonies of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydromedusoe,</hi> an interpretation necessitated by the structure
                    of their medusiform persons, forbids their separation from that group.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fossil Hydrozoa.</hi> —The researches of Moseley have
                    necessitated a redistribution of the group of <hi rend="italic">Anthozoa</hi>

                    assigned to the <hi rend="italic">Hydrozoa,</hi> but the grounds for placing
                    them in this position are very slight, owing to the imperfect nature of the
                    remains. A discussion of the small amount of structure which they present would
                    be out of place here.</p>

                    render the relations of the two forms clear. <hi rend="italic">Ctenaria</hi> has
                    the margin of its disc narrowed so as to give the organism a spherical form. The
                    approximated margins bound an orifice leading to the sub-umbrella space. This
                    orifice corresponds to the so-called mouth of a <hi rend="italic">Cydippe.</hi>
                    Further, <hi rend="italic">Ctenaria</hi> has two, and only two, long-fringed
                    tentacles, like those of <hi rend="italic">Cydippe,</hi> and each springing from
                    a pocket as in that genus, and on the surface of its spheroidal umbrella eight
                    rows of differentiated ectodermal cells, which though not ciliated correspond
                    closely in position with the eight ctenophoral ambulacra of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cydippe.</hi> The disposition of the enteric canalsystem of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ctenaria</hi> is, as shown in the cut, also transitional in the direction of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cydippe.</hi> Apart from the existence of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ctenaria,</hi> the homologies suggested by Haeckel between <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydromedusae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ctenophora</hi> are such as to commend
