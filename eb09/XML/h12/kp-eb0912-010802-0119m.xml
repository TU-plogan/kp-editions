                    Of the date of Homer probably no record, real or pretended, ever existed.
                    Herodotus (ii. 53) maintains that Hesiod and Homer lived not more than 400 years
                    before his own time, consequently not much before 850 B.c From the controversial
                    tone in which he expresses himself it is evident that others had made Homer more
                    ancient; and accordingly the dates given by later authorities, though very
                    various, generally fall within the 10th and 11th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> It is needless to go into the questions raised by these statements,
                    none of which has any claim to the character of external evidence.<note

                <p>The extant lives of Homer (edited in Westermann’s <hi rend="italic">Vitarum
                    Scriptores Graeci</hi><hi rend="italic">minores)</hi> are eight in number,
                    including the piece called the <hi rend="italic">Contest of Hesiod and
                    Homer.</hi> The longest is written in the Ionic dialect, and bears the name of
                    Herodotus, but is certainly spurious. According to Jυh. Schmidt (in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertationes</hi><hi rend="italic">philological Halenses,</hi>
                    vol. ii. pp. 97-219), it belongs to the time which was fruitful beyond all
                    others in literary forgeries, viz., the 2d century of our era. The other lives
                    are probably not more ancient. They contain a strange medley, ranging from the
                    simplest outgrowth of popular fancy to the frigid inventions of the age which
                    would not confess itself ignorant of the name of Hecuba’s mother. Thus the story
                    that Homer was the son of the Meles (the river on which Smyrna is situated) and
                    the nymph Critheis is evidently a local legend. Another story of a primitive
                    cast describes the manner of Homer’s death in the island of los. Seeing some
                    young fishermen on the beach with their nets, he asked them—</p>
                <p>“Fishermen sprung of Arcadia, have we aught ?”</p>
                <p>To which they answered in a riddle—</p>
                <p>“What we caught we left behind, What we caught not we bear with us.”</p>
                <p>Homer could not explain this, and then he remembered an oracle which had told him
                    to beware of the young men’s riddle. He wrote an epitaph for himself, and died
                    on the third day after. This story comes from a lost work of Aristotle. On the
                    other hand, when we are told in the Herodoteanlife that Critheis was a daughter
                    of Melanopus, one of the colonists who came to Cyme from Magnesia, that being
                    found to be with child she was sent with the fresh <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n120/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0120-0109"/> colony that founded Smyrna, that she there
                    brought forth Homer on the banks ot the Meles, whence he was called
                    Melesigenes,—in this form of the story it is easy to recognize the hand of the
                    critic. There is an evident desire to get rid of the primitive supernatural
                    element, and also to reconcile the claims of two cities, Cyme and Smyrna, to the
                    envied distinction of giving birth to Homer. There are other incidents in the
                    Herodotean life which seem devised merely to fit certain of the minor characters
                    in the Homeric poems. Phemius, we are told, was a schoolmaster of Smyrna, who
                    was kind to the young Melesigenes, and was accordingly immortalized as the
                    singer in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey;</hi> the original of Mentor was a man
                    of Ithaca, who entertained Homer and tended him in illness; and so on.</p>
                <p>The chief value of these “Lives,” and especially of the Herodotean life, lies in
                    the curious short poems which they have preserved. These poems are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epigrams</hi> which used to be printed at the end of Homer, but
                    are banished by the somewhat inconvenient purism of modern editors, One of them
                    <hi rend="italic">{Epigr.</hi> iv.) is put in the mouth of a native of “Aeolian
                    Smyrna,” whose poetical aid has been spurned by the people of Cyme, and who is
                    accordingly departing to some other city. <hi rend="italic">Epigr.</hi> vi. is a
                    prayer to Poseidon for safe arrival at Erythrae; <hi rend="italic">Epigr.</hi>
                    vii. describes the rocky soil of that place. There is also an Epigram addressed
                    to the people of Neonteichos <hi rend="italic">{Epigr.</hi> i.), and another
                    which brings in the pine woods of Mount Ida and the iron-mines of that district
                    <hi rend="italic">{Epigr.</hi> x,). Besides these pieces, the interest of which
                    is topographical, there is an interesting little poem addressed to potters,
                    beginning—</p>
                <p>‘ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> If you give me hire I will sing, 0 potters,”</p>
                <p>and another called Eιp∈σ∙ιωv∙&gt;7, which, according to the author of the life,
                    was sung by the children in Samos when they went round begging at the festival
                    of Apollo; also certain verses addressed to sailors (viit, ix.), to a goat-herd
                    (xi,), &amp;c. All these short poems have a common character. They are “rhymes”
                    such as every country possesses in greater or less number, treasured by the
                    people as a kind of proverbs. Some of them may be fragments of longer poems, but
                    they are certainly not the work of any one poet. The circumstance that they are
                    ascribed to Homer merely shows that his name had gained such a hold on the
                    imagination of the Ionian and Aeolian Greeks as to draw to itself all ancient
                    and popular verse.</p>
                <p>Such being the true character of the <hi rend="italic">Epigrams,</hi> it follows
                    that, so far from being “occasional verses,” suggested by moments in Homer’s
                    life, they are really the original documents, to which the narrative was
                    afterwards adjusted. Even the leading incident of the Herodotean life—the birth
                    of Homer at Smyrna—may have been originally derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epigr.</hi> iv. The epithet “Aeolian” indicates high antiquity; for Smyrna
                    (according to Herodotus) was lost by the Aeolians about 688 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Similarly, the claim of Cyme was doubtless supported (not quite so
                    logically) by the mention of that place in <hi rend="italic">Epigr.</hi> iv. and
                    i.</p>
                <p>The same line of argument may be extended to the <hi rend="italic">Hymns,</hi>
                    and even to some of the lost works of the “Cyclic” poets; with the result of
                    making it probable that most of the traditions about Homer rest ultimately on
                    poems commonly ascribed to him. Thus—</p>
                <p>1. The hymn to the Delian Apollo ends with an address of the poet to his
                    audience. When any stranger comes and asks who is the sweetest singer, they are
                    to answer with one voice, the “blind man that dwells in rocky Chios; his songs
                    deserve the prize for all time to come.” Thucydides, who quotes this passage to
                    show the ancient character of the Delian festival, seems to have no doubt of the
                    Homeric authorship of the hymn. Hence we may most naturally account for the
                    belief that Homer was a Chian. That it was a general belief is shown by a
                    passage (interesting as the earliest express quotation from Homer) in which
                    Simonides calls him simply the “man of Chios” (fr. 85):—</p>
                <p>Ey δ∈ τδ <hi rend="italic">κiKKιστov Xlos ttιπtv αvi</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >àvSpûv.</hi></p>
                <p>It was also supported by the Chian family or gens of Homeridae, of whom more will
                    be said hereafter.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Margites—</hi> a humorous poem which kept its ground as
                    the reputed work of Homer down to the time of Aristotle—began with the words,
                    “There came to Colophon an old man, a divine singer, servant of the Muses and
                    Apollo.” Hence doubtless the claim of Colophon to be the native city of Homer—a
                    claim supported in the early times of Homeric learning by the Colophonian poet
                    and grammarian Antimachus.</p>
                <p>3. The poem called the <hi rend="italic">Cypria</hi> was said to have been given
                    by Homer to Stasinus of Cyprus as a daughter’s dowry. The connexion with Cyprus
                    appears further in the predominance given in the poem to Aphrodite. From the
                    argument preserved by Proclus it is evident that Aphrodite held the same place
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Cypria</hi> which Athene has in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi></p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Little Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phocais,</hi> according to the Herodotean life, were composed by Homer when he
                    lived at Phocaea with a certain Thestorides, who carried them off to Chios and
                    there gained fame by reciting them as his own. The name Thestorides occurs in
                    <hi rend="italic">Epigr.</hi> v.</p>
                <p>These indications make it probable that the stories connecting Homer with
                    different cities and islands do not rest upon any better foundation than
                    supposed allusions in poems, none of which, to all appearance, can make good the
                    claim to Homeric authorship. And this result is confirmed by the want of
                    positive authority in favour of any one version. The number of opinions is
                    proverbial, and most of them are supported by relatively ancient testimony.</p>
                <p>It is plain that the contention for Homer began at a time when his real history
                    had been lost. And since the inevitable legend found no clue in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> it was driven to
                    seek for one in poems of secondary value.</p>
                <p>A singular exception is formed by Miletus, one of the greatest of Ionian cities,
                    for which no legend claims even a visit from Homer. Yet Arctinus of Miletus is
                    said to have been a “disciple of Homer,” and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aethiopis</hi> was a continuation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Another
                    equally exceptional fact is that no poem of Arctinus is ever ascribed to Homer.
                    Are we to suppose that the authorship of the poems of Arctinus never fell into
                    doubt? If so, it is a confirmation, from the negative side, of the theory
                    advanced above, viz., that the stories of Homer’s connexion with different
                    places are suggested for the most part by the poems which came to be assigned to
                    him in popular belief.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Recitation of the Poems.—</hi> The recitation of epic poetry
                    was called in historical times “rhapsody” (ραψωδία). The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >ραψωδός</hi> is post-Homeric, but occurs in Pindar, who gives two different
                    explanations of it—“singer of stitched verse” <hi rend="italic">{ραπτών</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iπεωv aocδoi),</hi> and “singer with the wand” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{paβδo&lt;s).</hi> Of these the first is etymologically correct (except that it
                    should rather be “stitcher of verse ”); the second agrees with the fact, for
                    which there is early evidence, that the reciter was accustomed to hold a wand in
                    his hand—perhaps, like the sceptre in the Homeric assembly, as a'symbol of the
                    right to a hearing. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>The first notice of rhapsody meets us at Sicyon, in the reign of Clisthenes
                    (600-560 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> who, as Herodotus tells us (v. 67),
                    “put down the rhapsodists on account of the poems of Homer, because they are all
                    about Argos and the Argives.” This description applies very well to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> in which Argos and Argives occur on almost every page.
                    It may have suited the <hi rend="italic">Thebaid</hi> still better, but there is
                    no <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Compare the branch of myrtle at an Athenian

                    case the incident shows that the poems of the Ionic Homer had gained in the 6th

                    Peloponnesus, the ascendency, the national importance, and the almost canonical

                <p>At Athens there was a law that the Homeric poems should be recited <hi
                    rend="italic">{paψωδcισθaι)</hi> on every occasion of the Panathenaea. This law
                    is appealed to as an especial glory of Athens by the orator Lycurgus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Leocr.,</hi> 102). Perhaps therefore the custom of public
                    recitation was exceptional, and unfortunately we do not know when or by whom it
                    was introduced. The Platonic dialogue <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi>
                    attributes it to Hipparchus, son of Pisistratus. This, however, is part of the
                    historical myth, in the Platonic style, of which the dialogue mainly consists.
                    The choice of a member of the tyrant family as the type of an enlightened despot
                    was evidently made, not on grounds of evidence, but merely as a sign of reaction
                    against popular sentiment. Moreover, the author of the dialogue makes (perhaps
                    wilfully) all the historical mistakes which Thucydides notices in a well-known
                    passage (vi. 54-59). In one point, however, his testimony is valuable. He tells
                    us that the law required the rhapsodists to recite “taking each other up in
                    order (t£ ύττολ^ως ∈φe⅞i}ς), as they still do.” This recurs in a different form
                    in ths statement of Diogenes Laertius (i. 2, 57) that Solon made a law that the
                    poems should be recited “with prompting” (so we must understand <hi
                    rend="italic">υποβολής).</hi> The question as between Solon and Hipparchus
                    cannot be settled; but it is at least clear that a due order of recitation was
                    secured by the presence of a person charged to give the rhapsodists their cue
                    <hi rend="italic">(iποβαλλeιv).</hi> It was necessary, of course, to divide the
                    poem to be recited into parts, and to compel each contending rhapsodist to take
                    the part assigned to him. Otherwise they would choose favourite or show
                    passages.</p>
                <p>The practice af pcete or rnapsodists (we cannot always teil which) contending for
                    the prize at the great religious festivals is of considerable antiquity, though
                    apparently post-Homeric. It is brought vividly before us in the Hymn to Apollo
                    (see the passage mentioned above), and in two Hymns to Aphrodite (v. and ix.).
                    The latter of these may evidently be taken to belong to Salamis in Cyprus and
                    the festival of the Cyprian Aphrodite, in the same way that the hymn to Apollo
                    belongs to Delos and the Delian gathering. The germ of such contests may,
                    however, be found in the story of Thamyris, the Thracian singer, who boasted
                    that he could conquer even the Muses in song <hi rend="italic">(II.</hi> ii.
                    594#.).</p>
                <p>Much has been made in this part of the subject of a family or clan (γ⅛oς) of
                    Homeridae in the island of Chios. On the one hand, it seemed to follow from the
                    existence of such a family that Homer is a mere “eponymus,” or mythical
                    ancestor; on the other hand, it became easy to imagine the Homeric poems handed
                    down orally in a family whose hereditary occupation it was to recite them,
                    possibly to add new episodes from time to time, or to combine their materials in
                    new ways, as their poetical gifts permitted. But, although there is no reason to
                    doubt the existence of a family of “Homeridae,” it is far from certain.that they
                    had anything to do with Homeric poetry. The word occurs first in Pindar <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hem.</hi> 2, 2), who applies it to the rhapsodists <hi
                    rend="italic">{'Oμηρlδαι</hi> pα7rτωv ∈τreωv doιδoi). On this a scholiast says
                    that “Homeridae” denoted originally the descendants of Homer, who sang his poems
                    in succession, but afterwards the rhapsodists who did not claim descent from
                    him. He adds that there was a famous rhapsodist, Cynaethus of Chios, who was
                    said to be the author of the Hymn to Apollo, and to have first recited Homer at
                    Syracuse about the 69th Olympiad. Nothing here connects the Homeridae with
                    Chios. Our knowledge of Chian Homeridae comes chiefly from the lexicon of
                    Harpocration, where we are told that Acusilaus and Hellanicus said that they
                    were so called from the poet, but that Seleucus pronounced this to be an error.
                    Strabo, also, says that the Chians put forward the Homeridae as an argument in
                    support of their claim to Homer. These Homeridae, then, belonged to Chios, but
                    there is no indication of their being rhapsodists. On the contrary, Plato uses
                    the word to include interpreters and admirers—in short, the whole “spiritual
                    kindred ”—of Homer <hi rend="italic">{Pep.,</hi> 599 E; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaεdr.,</hi> 252 B; <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi> 530 D). And although we hear
                    of “descendants of Creophylus” as in possession of the Homeric poems, there is
                    no similar story about descendants of Homer himself. Such is the evidence on
                    which so many inferences are based.</p>
                <p>The result of the notices now collected is-to show that the early history of epic
                    recitation consists of (1) passages in the Homeric hymns showing that poets
                    contended for the prize at the great festivals, (2) the passing mention in
                    Herodotus of rhapsodists at Sicyon, and (3) a law at Athens, of unknown
                    date,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the assertions
                    of the Platonic <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi> and of Diogenes Laertius are
                    contradictory. The orators Lycurgus and Isocrates give no date. The question is
                    complicated by the stories about Pisistratus.</p></note> regulating the
                    recitation at the Panathenaea. Let us now compare these data with the account
                    given in the Homeric poems. The word “rhapsode” does not yet exist; we hear only
                    of the “singer” (άοιδόν), who does not carry a wand or laurelbranch, but the
                    lyre <hi rend="italic">{φορμιγξ),</hi> with which he accompanies his “song.” In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> even the epic “singer” is not met with, but
                    Achilles himself sings the stories of heroes (κλ∈α <hi rend="italic"
                    >avδpwv}</hi> in his tent, and Patroclus is waiting apparently to take up the
                    song in his turn <hi rend="italic">{II.</hi> ix. 191). Again we do not hear of
                    poetical contests (except in the story of Thamyris already mentioned) or of
                    recitation of epic poetry at festivals. The <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> gives
                    us pictures of two great houses, in Ithaca and in Phaeacia; and each has its
                    singer. The song is on a subject taken from the Trojan war, at some point chosen
                    by the singer himself, or by his hearers. Thus Phemius pleases the suitors by
                    singing of the calamitous return of the Greeks; Demodocus sings of a quarrel
                    between Ulysses and Achilles, and then, on being asked to change the theme, of
                    the wooden horse and the capture of Troy.</p>
                <p>It may be granted that the author of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> can
                    hardly have been just such a singer as he himself describes. The songs of
                    Phemius and Demodocus are too short, and have too much the character of
                    improvisations. Nor is it necessary to suppose that epic poetry, at the time to
                    which the picture in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> belongs, was confined to
                    the one type represented. Yet in several respects the conditions under which the
                    singer finds himself in the house of a chief like Odysseus or Alcinous are more
                    in harmony with the character of Homeric poetry than those of the later
                    rhapsodic contests. The subdivision of a poem like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> among different and necessarily
                    unequal performers must have been injurious to the effect. The highly theatrical
                    manner of recitation which was fostered by the spirit of competition, and by
                    the· example of the stage, cannot have done justice to the even movement of the
                    epic style. It is not certain indeed that the practice of reciting a long poem
                    by the agency of several competitors was ancient, or that it prevailed elsewhere
                    than at Athens; but as rhapsodists were numerous, and popular favour throughout
                    Greece became more and more confined to one or two great works, it must have
                    become almost a <pb break="no"

                <p>The difference made by substituting the wand or branch of laurel for the lyre of
                    the Homeric singer is a slighter one, though not without significance. The
                    recitation of the Hesiodic poems was from the first unaccompanied by the
                    lyre,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So Pausanias (ix.

                    >i.e.,</hi> they were confessedly <hi rend="italic">said, not sung;</hi> and it
                    was natural that the example should be extended to Homer. For it is difficult to
                    believe that the Homeric poems were ever “sung” in the strict sense of the word.
                    We can only suppose that the lyre in the hands of the epic poet or reciter was
                    in reality a piece of convention, a “survival” from the stage in which narrative
                    poetry had a lyrical character. Probably the poets of the Homeric school—that
                    which dealt with war and adventure—were the genuine descendants of minstrels
                    whose “lays” or “ballads” were the amusement of the feasts in an earlier heroic
                    age; whereas the Hesiodic compositions were non-lyrical from the first, and were
                    only in verse because that was the universal form of literature.</p>
                <p>It seems, then, that if we imagine Homer as a singer in a royal house of the
                    Homeric age, but with more freedom regarding the limits of his subject, and a
                    more tranquil audience than is allowed him in the rapid movement of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> we shall probably not be far from the truth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Time and Place of Homer.—</hi> The oldest direct references to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> are in
                    Herodotus, who quotes from both poems (ii. 53). The quotation from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is of interest because it is made in order to show that
                    Homer supported the story of the travels of Paris to Egypt and Sidon (whereas
                    the Cyclic poem called the <hi rend="italic">Cypria</hi> ignored them), and also
                    because the part of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> from which it comes is
                    cited as the “Aristeia of Diomede.” This was therefore a recognized part of the
                    poem.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The difficulty

                    aside the modern division into books, and looking to the narrative, we see that
                    the Aristeia of Diomede extends from the beginning of Book v. to ver. 311 in
                    Book vi. See the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Philology,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    214.</p></note></p>
                <p>The earliest mention of the name of Homer is found in a fragment of the
                    philosopher Xenophanes (of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> or
                    possibly earlier), who complains of the false notions implanted through the
                    teaching of Homer (&lt;⅛ άρχί}? <hi rend="superscript"> κα</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="italic">"Όμηρον</hi><hi rend="italic">επει μεμaθηκασι</hi> τrdvτeς). The
                    passage shows, not merely that Homer was well known at Colophon in the time of
                    Xenophanes, but also that the great advance in moral and religious ideas which
                    forced Plato to banish Homer from his republic had made itself felt in the days
                    of the early Ionic philosophers.</p>
                <p>Failing external testimony, the time and place of the Homeric poems can only be
                    determined (if at all) by internal evidence. This is of two main kinds :—(1)
                    evidence of history, consisting in a comparison of the political and social
                    condition, the geography, the institutions, the manners, arts, and ideas of
                    Homer with those of other times; (2) evidence of language, consisting in a
                    comparison with later dialects, in respect of grammar and vocabulary. To these
                    may be added, as occasionally of value, (3) evidence of the direct influence of
                    Homer upon the subsequent course of literature and art.</p>
                <p>(1) The political condition of Greece in the earliest times known to history is
                    separated from the Greece of Homer by an interval which can hardly be
                    overestimated. The great national names are different: instead of Achaeans,
                    Argives,</p>
                <p>Danai, we find Hellenes, Dorians, Ionians, Aeolians—names either unknown to
                    Homer, or mentioned in terms more significant than silence. Mycenae is no longer
                    the centre of empire; new empires, polities, and civilizations have grown
                    up,—Sparta with its military discipline, Delphi with its religious supremacy,
                    Miletus with its commerce and numberless colonies, Aeolis and Ionia, Sicily and
                    Magna Graecia.</p>
                <p>While the political centre of Homeric Greece is Mycenae, the real centre is
                    evidently Boeotia. The Catalogue of the Ships begins with Boeotia; the list of
                    Boeotian towns is much the longest; and they sail, not from the bay of Argos,
                    but from the Boeotian harbour of Aulis. This position is not due to its chiefs,
                    who are all of inferior rank. The importance of Boeotia for civilization is
                    further shown by the ancient worship of the Muses on Mount Helicon, and the fact
                    that the oldest poet whose birthplace is known was the Boeotian Hesiod. Next to
                    Boeotia and the neighbouring countries, Phocis, Locris, Athens, it appears that
                    the Peloponnesus, Crete, and Thessaly are the most important seats of Greek
                    population.</p>
                <p>In the Peloponnesus the face of things was completely altered by the Dorian
                    conquest, no trace of which is found in Homer. The only Dorians known in Homer
                    are those that the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xix. 177) places in Crete. It
                    seems difficult to connect them with the Dorians of history.</p>
                <p>The eastern shores of the Aegean, which the earliest historical records represent
                    to us as the seat of a brilliant civilization, giving way before the advance of
                    the great military empires (Lydia and afterwards Persia), are almost a blank in
                    Homer’s map. The line of settlements can be traced in the Catalogue from Crete
                    to Rhodes, and embraces the neighbouring islands of Cos and Calymnos. The
                    colonization of Rhodes by Tlepolemus is related <hi rend="italic">{fl.</hi> ii.
                    661 ff.), and seems to mark the furthest point reached in the Homeric age.
                    Between Rhodes and the Troad the only name is Miletus, and that is still in the
                    hands of “barbarous speaking” Carians. Even the Cyclades—Naxos, Paros, Melos—are
                    unknown to the Homeric world. The disposition of the Greeks to look to the west
                    for the centres of religious feeling appears in the mention of Dodona and the
                    Dodonaean Zeus, put in the mouth of the Thessalian Achilles.</p>
                <p>To the north we find the Thracians, known from the stories of Thamyris the singer
                    (ZZ. ii. 595), and Lycurgus, the enemy of the young god Dionysus <hi
                    rend="italic">(II.</hi> vi. 130). Here the Trojan empire begins. It does not
                    appear, however, that the Trojans are thought of as people of a different
                    language. As this is expressly said of the Carians, and of the Trojan allies who
                    were “summoned from afar,” the contrary rather is implied regarding Troy
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The mixed type of government described by Homer— consisting of a king guided by a
                    council of elders, and bringing all important resolutions before the assembly of
                    the fighting men—does not seem to have been universal in Indo-European
                    communities, but to have grown up in many different parts of the world under the
                    stress of similar conditions. The king is the commander in war, and the office
                    probably owed its existence to military necessities. It is not surrounded with
                    any special sacredness. There were ruling families, laying claim to divine
                    descent, from whom the king was naturally chosen, but his own fitness is the
                    essence of his title. The aged Laertes is set aside; the young Telemachus does
                    not succeed as a matter of course. Nor are any very definite rights attached to
                    the office. Each tribe in the army before Troy was commanded by its own king (or
                    kings); but Agamemnon was supreme, because he was “more a king” <hi
                    rend="italic">(βασιλεvτεpος)</hi> than any other. The assembly is summoned on
                    all critical occasions, and its approval is the ultimate sanction. A king

                    warlike skill and prowess. Even the division of the spoil is not made in the <hi

                    The taking of Briseis from Achilles was an arbitrary act, and against all rule
                    and custom. The council is more difficult to understand. The “elders” (γepovτeς)
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> are the same as the subordinate “kings”;
                    they are summoned by Agamemnon to his tent, and form a small council of nine or
                    ten persons. In Troy we hear of elders of the people <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fηpoyepovτ^)</hi> who are with Priam, and are men past the military age. So in
                    Ithaca there are elders who have not gone to Troy with the army. It would seem
                    therefore that the meeting in Agamemnon’s tent was only a copy or adaptation of
                    the true constitutional “council of elders,” which indeed was essentially
                    unfitted for the purposes of military service.</p>
                <p>Priesthood in Homer is found in the case of particular temples, where an officer
                    is naturally wanted to take charge of the sacred inclosure and the sacrifices
                    offered within it. It is perhaps an accident that we do not hear of priests in
                    Ithaca. Agamemnon performs sacrifice himself, not because a priestly character
                    was attached to the kingly office, but simply because he was “master in his own
                    house.”</p>
                <p>The conception of “law” is foreign to Homer. The later words for it <hi
                    rend="italic">(v0po&lt;s,</hi><hi rend="italic">ρήτρα.)</hi> are unknown, and
                    the terms which he uses <hi rend="italic">(8iκη</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >θeμις)</hi> mean merely “custom.” Judicial functions are in the hands of the
                    elders, who “have to do with suits” (δtκαστr0λoι), and “uphold judgments”
                    (0∈∕uσ∙τας eipυaτaι). On such matters as the compensation in cases of homicide,
                    it is evident that there were no rules, but merely a feeling, created by use and
                    wont, that the relatives of the slain man should be willing to accept payment.
                    The sense of anger which follows a violation of custom has the name of “Nemesis
                    ”—righteous displeasure.</p>
                <p>As there is no law in Homer, so there is no morality. That is to say, there are
                    no general principles of action, and no words which indicate that acts have been
                    classified as good or bad, right or wrong. Moral <hi rend="italic">feeling,</hi>
                    indeed, existed, and was denoted by “Aidos”; but the numerous meanings of this
                    word—shame, veneration, pity—show how rudimentary the idea was. And when we look
                    to practice we find that cruel and even treacherous deeds are spoken of without
                    the least sense that they deserve censure. The heroes of Homer are hardly more
                    moral agents than the giants and enchanters of a fairy tale.<note

                    ii.</p></note></p>
                <p>The religious ideas of Homer differ in some important points from those of later
                    Greece. The Apollo of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> has the character of a
                    local deity—“ruler of Chryse and goodly Cilla and Tenedos.” He may be compared
                    with the Clarian and the Lycian god, but he is unlike the Apollo of Dorian
                    times, the “deliverer” and giver of oracles. Again, the worship of Dionysus, and
                    of Demeter and Persephone, is mainly or whoily post-Homeric. The greatest
                    difference, however, lies in the absence of hero-worship from the Homeric order
                    of things. Castor and Polydeuces, for instance, are simply brothers of Helen who
                    died before the expedition to Troy (ZZ. iii. 243).</p>
                <p>The military tactics of Homer belong to the age when the chariot was the
                    principal engine of warfare. Cavalry is unknown, and the battles are mainly
                    decided by the prowess of the chiefs. The use of the trumpet is also later. It
                    has been supposed indeed that the art of riding was known in Homer’s own time,
                    because it occurs in comparisons. But the riding which he describes (ZZ. xv.
                    679) is a mere exhibition of skill, such as we may see in a modern circus. And
                    though he mentions the trumpet (ZZ. xviii. 219), there is nothing to show that
                    it was used, as in historical times, to give the signal for the charge. The
                    chief industries of Homeric times are those of the carpenter (τeκτωv), the
                    worker in leather (σκυτοτόμος), the smith or worker in metal (χαλκ∈υ'ς),—whose
                    implements are the hammer and pincers,—and the potter (κ∈pαμ∈υ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> z</hi> ς); also spinning and weaving, which were carried on
                    by the women. The fine arts are represented by sculpture in relief, carving in
                    wood and ivory, embroidery. Statuary is later; it appears to have come into
                    existence in the 7th century, about the time when casting in metal was invented
                    by Rhoecus of Samos. In general, as has been well shown by Mr A. S. Murray,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Contemporary Review,</hi> vol. xxiii. p. 218 ff.</p></note> Homeric art does
                    not rise above the stage of <hi rend="italic">decoration,</hi> applied to
                    objects in common use; while in point of style it is characterized by a richness
                    and variety of ornament which is in the strongest contrast to the simplicity of
                    the best periods. It is the work, in short, not of artists but of skilled
                    workmen; the ideal artist is “Daedalus,” a name which implies mechanical skill
                    and intricate workmanship, not beauty of design. Mr Murray further shows
                    (following Professor Brunn of Munich) that the Greek art of the Homeric period
                    is identical in origin with contemporary Assyrian work. The sculptures on the
                    shield of Achilles, in particular, are quite Assyrian in type; and the same may
                    be said of the work which has the best claim to equal antiquity with the Homeric
                    poems—the lions sculptured in flat relief over the gate of Mycenae.</p>
                <p>One art of the highest importance remains. The question whether writing was known
                    in the time of Homer was raised in antiquity, and has been debated with especial
                    eagerness ever since the appearance of Wolf’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prolegomena.</hi> In this case we have to consider not merely the indications
                    of the poems, but also the external evidence which we possess regarding the use
                    of writing in Greece. This latter kind of evidence is much more considerable now
                    than it was in Wolf’s time. It will be found in a very convenient form in A.

                <p>The oldest known stage of the Greek alphabet appears to be represented by
                    inscriptions of the islands of Thera, Melos, and Crete, which are referred to
                    the 40th Olympiad (620 B.C.). The oldest specimen of a distinctively Ionian
                    alphabet is the famous inscription of the mercenaries of Psammetichus, in Upper
                    Egypt, as to which the only doubt is whether the Psammetichus in question is the
                    first or the second, and consequently whether the inscription is to be dated 01.
                    40 or 01. 47. Considering that the divergence of two alphabets (like the
                    difference of two dialects) requires both time and familiar use, we may gather
                    from these facts that writing was well known in Greece early in the 7th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The fact that the Phoenician Van (J) was retained in the

                    after Homer’s time, if indeed it was still pronounced then. It seems probable
                    therefore that the introduction of the alphabet is not later than the
                    composition of the Homeric poems.</p></note></p>
                <p>The rise of prose composition in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.</hi>
                    has been thought to mark the time when memory was practically superseded by
                    writing as a means of preserving literature,—the earlier use of letters being
                    confined to short documents, such as lists of names, treaties, laws, &amp;c.
                    This conclusion, however, is by no means necessary. It may be that down to
                    comparatively late times poetry was not commonly read, but was recited from
                    memory. But the question is—From what time are we to suppose that the
                    preservation of long poems was generally secured by the existence of written
                    conies? Now, without counting the Homeric <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n124/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0124-0113"/> poems—which doubtless had exceptional advantages
                    in their fame and popularity—we find a body of literature dating from the 8th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to which the theory of oral transmission
                    is wholly inapplicable. In the Trojan cycle alone we know of the two epics of
                    Arctinus, the <hi rend="italic">Little Iliad</hi> of Lesches, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cypria,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Nostoi.</hi> The Theban cycle
                    is represented by the <hi rend="italic">Thebaid</hi> (which Callinus, who was of
                    the 7th century, ascribed to Homer) and the <hi rend="italic">Epigoni.</hi>
                    Other ancient epics—ancient enough to have passed under the name of Homer—are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Talcing of (Echalia,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phocdis.</hi> Again, there are the numerous works attributed to Hesiod and
                    other poets of the didactic and the quasi-historical schools,—Eumelus of
                    Corinth, Cinaethon of Sparta, Agias of Troezen, and many more. The preservation
                    of this vast mass is not explained by any of the various considerations which
                    have been brought to bear on the Homeric poems—national interest, families of
                    rhapsodists, public recitation, &amp;c. It can only be attributed to writing,
                    which must therefore have been in use for two centuries or more before there was
                    any considerable prose literature. Nor is this in itself improbable. On the
                    contrary, when we see how gradual and tentative progress is, and how great is
                    the influence of an established literary form, we must feel it to be probable
                    that the art of writing had been applied to the existing kinds of literature
                    long before it led to the creation of a new type.</p>
                <p>The further question, whether the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> were originally written, is much more difficult.
                    External evidence does not reach back so ‘far, and the internal evidence is
                    curiously indecisive. The only passage which can be interpreted as a reference
                    to writing occurs in the story of Bellerophon, told by Glaucus in the sixth book
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Proetus, king of Corinth, sent Bellerophon
                    to his father-in-law the king of Lycia, and gave him “baneful tokens, scratching
                    on a folded tablet many spirit-destroying things, and bade him show this to his
                    father-in-law, that he might perish.” The king of Lycia asked duly (on the tenth
                    day from the guest’s coming) for a token (r∕τ∈∈ <hi rend="italic">σηpα
                    I8iσθαi),</hi> and then knew what Proetus wished to be done.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word &lt;rημα means the

                    friendly recommendation, as it purported to be) “was a message of
                    death.”</p></note> In this account there is nothing to show exactly how the
                    message of Proetus was expressed. The use of writing for the purpose of the
                    token between “guest-friends” <hi rend="italic">(tessera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hospitalis)</hi> is certainly very ancient. Mommsen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hom.</hi><hi rend="italic">Forsch.,</hi> i. p. 338. <hi rend="italic">f.)</hi>
                    aptly compares the use in treaties, which are the oldest species of public
                    documents. But we may suppose that tokens of some kind—like the marks which the
                    Greek chiefs make on the lots <hi rend="italic">(II.</hi> vii. 175∕ ’.)— were in
                    use before writing was known. In any system of signs there were doubtless means
                    of recommending a friend, or giving warning of the presence of an enemy. There
                    is no difficulty, therefore, in understanding the message of Proetus without
                    alphabetical writing. But, on the other hand, there is no reason for so
                    understanding it.</p>
                <p>If the language of Homer is so ambiguous where the use of writing would naturally
                    be mentioned, we cannot expect to find more decisive references elsewhere.
                    Arguments have been founded upon the descriptions of the blind singers in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> with their songs inspired directly by the Muse;
                    upon the appeals of the poet to the Muses, especially in such a place as the
                    opening of the Catalogue; upon the Catalogue itself, which is a kind of
                    historical document put into verse to help the memory; upon the shipowner in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> who has “a good memory for his cargo,” &amp;c.
                    It may be answered, however, in the first place, that much of this is
                    traditional, handed down from the time when all poetry was unwritten, and in the
                    second place that the form of poetry is determined by the manner in which it is
                    used,—the recitation or performance, if we may give a wide meaning to that
                    term,—not by the manner in which it is composed or preserved. And the
                    “performance” of epic poetry still depended upon the power of memory long after
                    written copies were in existence. In short, it is one thing to recognize that a
                    literature is essentially oral in its form, characteristic of an age which was
                    one of hearing rather than of reading, and quite another to hold that the same
                    literature was preserved entirely by oral transmission. And finally, if writing
                    was used in Homeric times, the absence of all mention of it may be connected
                    with the peculiar silence—imposed doubtless by the tradition of his art—which
                    the poet observes regarding himself and his circumstances.</p>
                <p>The result of these various considerations seems to be that the age which we may
                    call the Homeric—the age which is brought before us in vivid outlines in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey—</hi> lies beyond the
                    earliest point to which history enables us to penetrate. And so far as we can
                    draw any conclusion as to the author (or authors) of the two poems, it is that
                    the whole debate between the cities of Aeolis and Ionia was wide of the mark.
                    The author of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> at least, was evidently a
                    European Greek who lived before the colonization of Asia Minor; and the claims
                    of the Asiatic cities mean no more than that in the days of their prosperity
                    these were the chief seats of the fame of Homer.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this point, see Mr Gladstone’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Homeric Synchronism,</hi> ch. iff.</p></note></p>
                <p>This is perhaps the place to consider whether the poems are to be regarded as
                    possessing in any degree the character of historical record. The question is one
                    which in the absence of satisfactory criteria will generally be decided by taste
                    and predilection. A few suggestions, however, may be made.</p>
                <p>1. The events of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> take place in a real locality,
                    the general features of which are kept steadily in view. There is no doubt about
                    Sigeum and Rhoeteum, or the rivers Scamander and Simois, or the islands Imbros,
                    Lemnos, and Tenedos. It is at least remarkable that a legend of the national
                    interest of the “tale of Troy” should be so definitely localized, and that in a
                    district which was never famous as a seat of Greek population.</p>
                <p>2. The discoveries of Schliemann prove that the Homeric Troy (which can hardly be
                    other than Hissarlik∙, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Troy)</hi> was an ancient seat
                    of pre-Hellenic population. This circumstance perhaps adds something to the
                    probability that the legend was founded on fact.</p>
                <p>3. The story of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is singularly free from the
                    exaggerated and marvellous character which belongs to most legends. The apple of
                    discord, the arrows of Philoctetes, the invulnerability of Achilles, and similar
                    fancies, are the additions of later poets. This sobriety, however, belongs not
                    to the whole <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> but to the events and characters of
                    the war. Such figures as Bellerophon, Niobe, the Amazons, which are thought of
                    as traditions from an earlier generation, show the marvellous element at
                    work.</p>
                <p>4. Certain persons and events in the story have a distinctly mythical stamp.
                    Helen is a figure of this kind. There was another story according to which she
                    was carried off by Theseus, and recovered by her brothers the Dioscuri. There
                    are even traces of a third version, in which the Messenian twins, Idas and
                    Lynceus, appear.</p>
                <p>5. The analogy of the French epic, the <hi rend="italic">Chanson de Roland,</hi>
                    favours the belief that there was some nucleus of fact. The defeat of Roncevaux
                    was really suffered by a part of Charlemagne’s army. But the Saracen army is
                    purely mythical, the true enemy having been the Gascons. Thus the element of
                    fact is found in the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> where the battle was fought,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the great emperor. If similarly we leave,
                    as historical, the plain of Troy, and the name Agamemnon, we shall perhaps not
                    be far wrong.</p>
                <p>(2) The dialect of Homer is properly to be called Old Ionic.: that is to say, it
                    is the dialect of which the New Ionic of Herodotus and the Attic are varieties,
                    but it is in a much earlier stage of development. The proof of this proposition
                    is to be obtained chiefly by comparing the grammatical formation and the syntax
                    of Homer with those of Attic. The comparison of the vocabulary is in the nature
                    of things less conclusive on the question of date. It would be impossible to
                    give the evidence in full without writing a Homeric grammar, but a few specimens
                    may be of interest.</p>

                <p>1. The first aorist in Greek being a “weak” tense, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    formed by a suffix (-&lt;τα), whereas the second aorist is a “strong” tense,
                    distinguished by the form of the root-syllable, we expect to find a constant
                    tendency to diminish the number of second aorists in use. No new second aorists,
                    we may be sure, were formed any more than new “strong” tenses, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">came</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sang,</hi> can be formed in
                    English. Now in Homer there are upwards of 80 second aorists (not reckoning
                    aorists of “Verbs in <hi rend="italic">μι,”</hi> such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >eστr</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">v, εβηv),</hi> Whereas in
                    all Attic prose not more than 30 are found. In this point therefore the Homeric
                    language is manifestly older. In Attic poets, it is true, the number of such
                    aorists is much larger than in prose. But here again we find that they bear
                    witness to Homer. Of the poetical aorists in Attic the larger part are also
                    Homeric. Others are not really Attic at all, but borrowed from earlier Aeolic
                    and Doric poetry. It is plain, in short, that the later poetical vocabulary was
                    separated from that of prose mainly by the forms which the influence of Homer
                    had saved from being forgotten.</p>
                <p>2. While the whole class of “strong” aorists diminished, certain smaller groups
                    in the class disappeared altogether. Thus we find in Homer—</p>
                <p>(a.) The second aorist middle without the “thematic” « or o: as <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛βλη-τo, was struck; eφθι-τo, perished</hi>; Sλ-T6, <hi rend="italic"
                    >leaped.</hi><hi rend="italic">{b.)</hi> The aorist formed by reduplication: as
                    δeδαev, <hi rend="italic">taught·,</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eKaβe'&lt;τθaι, to seize.</hi> These constitute a distinct formation, generally
                    with a “causative” meaning; the solitary Attic specimen is <hi rend="italic"
                    >tfyayov.</hi></p>
                <p>3. Another “exception,” which is really a survival from a former rule, is seen in
                    the short syllable of the plural of olδα <hi rend="italic">(tσμev,</hi> in Homer
                    <hi rend="italic">tZ-μev, tστc,</hi> &amp;c. ). Other examples occur in Homer,
                    both in the indicative and in the participle, as <hi rend="italic">aρηρωs,</hi>
                    fem. <hi rend="italic">apaρυ7a</hi>; so <hi rend="italic">μeμaκυ7a, lδv7a,</hi>
                    &amp;c. ). But this variation of the stem in different parts of a single tense
                    is exactly one of the complexities from which language is ever striving to free
                    itself; and accordingly in Attic it has all but disappeared.</p>
                <p>4. It had long been known that the subjunctive in Homer often takes a short vowel
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in the plural, <hi rend="italic">-oμer,</hi>-eτc
                    instead of <hi rend="italic">-ωμer, ∙∙ητe,</hi> and in the Mid. <hi
                    rend="italic">-oμaι,</hi> &amp;c., instead of <hi rend="italic">-ωμaι,</hi>
                    &amp;c. ). This was generally said to be done by “poetic licence,” or <hi
                    rend="italic">rnetri gratia.</hi> In fact, however, the Homeι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ic subjunctive is almost quite “regular,” though the
                    rule which it obeys is a different one from the Attic. It may be summed up by
                    saying that the subjunctive takes <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >∙η</hi> when the indicative has <hi rend="italic">o</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and not otherwise. Thus Homer has <hi rend="italic">f-μer, we go,
                    i-o-μe</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">∕, let us go.</hi> The
                    later <hi rend="italic">i-ω-μev</hi> was at first a solecism, an attempt to
                    conjugate a “verb in <hi rend="italic">μι”</hi> like the “verbs in <hi
                    rend="italic">ω.”</hi> It will be evident that under this rule the perfect and
                    first aorist subjunctive should always take a short vowel; and this accordingly
                    is the case, with very few exceptions.</p>
                <p>5. The article (∙δ, ⅞, <hi rend="italic">τ6)</hi> in Homer is chiefly used as an
                    independent pronoun <hi rend="italic">(he, she, it),</hi> a use which in Attic
                    appears only in a few combinations (such as &lt;5 <hi rend="italic">μev ....
                    δ</hi> δe, <hi rend="italic">the one . ... the other).</hi> This difference is
                    parallel to the relation between the Latin <hi rend="italic">ille</hi> and the
                    article of the Romance languages.</p>
                <p>6. The prepositions offer several points of comparison. What the grammarians
                    called “tmesis,” the separation of the preposition from the verb with which it
                    is compounded, is peculiar to Homer. The true account of the matter is that in
                    Homer the place of the preposition is not rigidly fixed, as it was afterwards.
                    Again ‘ ‘ with” is in Homer <hi rend="italic">σiv</hi> (with the dative), in
                    Attic prose <hi rend="italic">μera</hi> with the genitive. Here Attic poetry is
                    intermediate; the use of σ⅛ is retained as a piece of poetical tradition.</p>
                <p>7. In addition to the particle <hi rend="italic">hv,</hi> Homer has another, <hi
                    rend="italic">κev,</hi> hardly distinguishable in meaning. The Homeric uses of
                    <hi rend="italic">&amp;v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">κev</hi> are different in
                    several respects from the Attic, the general result being that the Homeric
                    syntax is more elastic. Thus <hi rend="italic">&amp;v</hi> and κ√are used in
                    Homer with the future, and with the subjunctive in simple sentences <hi
                    rend="italic">(oυκ &amp;v τoι</hi><hi rend="italic">χραίό-μρ,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">shall not avail thee).</hi> Again in clauses introduced by the
                    relative, or by <hi rend="italic">el, if,</hi> the subjunctive is found both
                    with and without <hi rend="italic">&amp;v</hi> or <hi rend="italic">κev</hi>;
                    whereas in Attic (except in a few poetical instances) <hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;v</hi> is always found (8s <hi rend="italic">&amp;v,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >èàv).</hi> And yet the Hömeric syntax is perfectly definite and precise. Homer
                    uses no constructions loosely or without corresponding differences of meaning.
                    His rules are equally strict with those of the later language, but they are not
                    the same rules. And they differ chiefly in this, that the less common
                    combinations of the earlier period were disused altogether in the later.</p>
                <p>8. In the vocabulary the most striking difference is that many words appear from
                    the metre to have contained a sound which they afterwards lost, viz., that which
                    is written in some Greek alphabets by the “digamma”/. Thus the words ⅛cαξ,
                    ⅛&lt;rτυ, <hi rend="italic">epyov, eπos,</hi> and many others must have been
                    written at one time <hi rend="italic">Fdraξ,</hi> ∕α&lt;ττυ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >fe'ργor, feπos.</hi> This letter, however, died out earlier in Ionic than in
                    most dialects, and there is no proof that the Homeric poems were ever written
                    with it.</p>
                <p>The points that have been mentioned, to which many others might be added, make it
                    clear that the Homeric and Attic dialects are separated by differences which
                    affect the whole structure of the language, and require a considerable time for
                    their development. At the same time there is hardly one of these differences
                    which cannot be accounted for by the natural growth of the language. It has been
                    thought indeed that the Homeric dialect was a mixed one, containing Aeolic and
                    even Doric forms, but the proof of this is scanty and doubtful. There are
                    doubtless many Homeric forms which were unknown to the later Ionic and Attic,
                    and which are found in Aeolic or other dialects. In general, however, these are
                    <hi rend="italic">older</hi> forms, which must have existed in Ionic at one
                    time, and may very well have belonged to the Ionic of Homer’s time. So too the
                    digamma is called “Aeolic” by grammarians, and is found on Aeolic and Doric
                    inscriptions. But the letter was one of the original alphabet, and was retained
                    universally as a numeral. It can only have fallen into disuse by degrees, as the
                    sound which it denoted ceased to be pronounced. The fact that there are so many
                    traces of it in Homer is a strong proof of the antiquity of the poems, but no
                    proof of admixture with Aeolic.</p>
                <p>There is one sense, however, in which an admixture of dialects may be recognized.
                    It is clear that the variety of forms in Homer is too great for any actual
                    spoken dialect. To take a single instance: it is impossible that the genitives
                    in -oto and in <hi rend="italic">-oυ</hi> should both have been in everyday use
                    together. The form in -oιo must have been poetical or literary, like our <hi
                    rend="italic">-eth</hi> of the third person singular, or like <hi rend="italic"
                    >ye</hi> for <hi rend="italic">you, whoso</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >whoever,</hi> and the like. The origin of such double forms is not far to seek.
                    The effect of dialect on style was always recognized in Greece, and the dialect
                    which had once been adopted by a particular kind of poetry was ever afterwards
                    adhered to. The Epic of Homer was doubtless formed originally from a spoken
                    variety of Ionic, but became literary and conventional with time. It is Homer’s
                    own testimony that all the Greeks spoke one language <hi rend="italic">(II.</hi>
                    iv. 437),—that is to say, that they understood one another, in spite of the
                    inevitable local differences. In these circumstances experience shows that some
                    one dialect gains a literary supremacy to which the whole nation yields. So
                    Tuscan became the type of Italian, and Anglian of English. But as soon as the
                    dialect is adopted, it begins to diverge from the colloquial form. Just as
                    modern poetical Italian uses many older grammatical forms peculiar to itself, so
                    the language of poetry, even in Homeric times, had formed a deposit (so to
                    speak) of archaic grammar. There were doubtless poets before Homer, as well as
                    brave men before Agamemnon; and indeed the formation of a conventional dialect
                    such as the Homeric must have been the work of several generations.</p>
                <p>The use of Ionic (instead of Aeolic) by the Boeotian poet Hesiod, in a kind of
                    poetry which was not of the Homeric type, tends to confirm the conclusion that
                    the literary ascendency of Ionic was anterior to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> It follows that the choice of
                    Ionic as the language of the Homeric poems is no argument for the Ionian birth
                    of their author (or authors).</p>
                <p>The argument for the antiquity of Homer founded upon the traces of Homeric
                    influence in later poetry cannot be profitably discussed without going into
                    details which would be out of place here. When a phrase or idea is found in
                    Homer, and again in a later author, we have to inquire whether it may not belong
                    to the common stock from which the poet of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> himself drew, and then whether it proves anything
                    as to the antiquity of the poems <hi rend="italic">in their present form.</hi>
                    Hence it is seldom that such considerations yield a satisfactory proof.<note

                    from the early epic poems called “cyclic.” The fragments of these poems, indeed,
                    are so scanty that we cannot compare them with Homer in respect of style or
                    language, but enough is known of their subjects to indicate that they presuppose

                    heroes, as elementary substances and forces (Agamemnon as the upper air,
                    &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>The next writers on Homer of the “grammatical” type were Stesimbrotus of Thasos
                    (contemporary with Cimon) and Antimachus of Colophon, himself an epic poet of
                    mark. The <hi rend="italic">Thebαid</hi> of Antimachus, however, was not
                    popular, and seems to have been a great storehouse of mythological learning
                    rather than a poem of the Homeric school.</p>
                <p>Other names of the pre-Socratic and Socratic times are mentioned by Xenophon,
                    Plato, and Aristotle. These were the “ancient Homerics” (οί <hi rend="italic"
                    >αρχαίοι Ομηρικοί),</hi> who busied themselves much with the hidden meanings of
                    Homer; of whom Aristotle says, with his profound insight, that they see the
                    small likenesses and overlook the great ones <hi rend="italic">(Metαph.,</hi>
                    xii.).</p>
                <p>The text of Homer must have attracted some attention when Antimachus came to be
                    known as the “correcter” (δzop0ωττjs) of a distinct edition (eκδo&lt;ns).
                    Aristotle is said himself to have made a recension for the use of Alexander the
                    Great. His remarks on Homer (in the <hi rend="italic">Poetics</hi> and
                    elsewhere) show that he had made a careful study of the structure and leading
                    ideas of the poems, but do not throw much light on the text.</p>
                <p>The real work of criticism became possible only when great collections of
                    manuscripts began to be made by the princes of the generation after Alexander,
                    and when men of learning were employed to sift and arrange these treasures. In
                    this way tire great Alexandrian school of Homeric criticism began with
                    Zenodotus, the first chief of the Museum, and was continued by Aristophanes and
                    Aristarchus. In Aristarchus ancient philology culminated, as philosophy had done
                    in Socrates. All earlier learning either passed into his w ritings, or was lost;
                    all subsequent research turned upon his critical and grammatical work.</p>
                <p>The means of forming a judgment of the criticism of Aristarchus are scanty. The
                    literary form which preserved the works of the great historians was
                    unfortunately wanting, or was not sufficiently valued, in the case of the
                    grammarians. Abridgments and newer treatises soon drove out the writings of
                    Aristarchus and other founders of the science. Moreover, a recension could not
                    be reproduced without new errors soon creeping in. Thus we find that Didymus,
                    writing in the time of Cicero, does not quote the readings of Aristarchus as we
                    should quote a <hi rend="italic">textus receptus.</hi> Indeed, the object of his
                    work seems to have been to determine what those readings were. Enough, however,
                    remains to show that Aristarchus had a clear notion of the chief problems of
                    philology (except perhaps those concerning etymology). He saw, for example, that
                    it was not enough to find a meaning for the archaic λvords (the <hi
                    rend="italic">yKωσσaι,</hi> as they were called), but that common words (such as
                    <hi rend="italic">π6vos, φ6βos)</hi> had their Homeric uses, which were to be
                    gathered by due induction. In the same spirit he looked upon the ideas and
                    beliefs of Homer as a consistent whole, which might be determined from the
                    evidence of the poems. He noticed especially the difference between the stories
                    known to Homer and those given by later poets, and made many comparisons between
                    Homeric and later manners, arts, and institutions. Again, he was sensible of the
                    paramount value of manuscript authority, and appears to have introduced no
                    readings from mere conjecture. The frequent mention in the Scholia of “better”
                    and “inferior” texts may indicate a classification made by him. His use of the
                    “obelus” to distinguish spurious verses, which made so large a part of his fame
                    in antiquity, has rather told against him with modern scholars.<note

                    to the existence of numerous interpolations. On this matter, however, we are
                    left to mere conjecture. The quotations from Homer in pre-Alexandrian authors
                    are so inaccurate as to throw little or no light on the text which they used. It
                    is at least clear that our manuscripts are much more trustworthy than the
                    recollection of these ancient writers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    written in the 10th century, contains (1) the best text of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> (2) the critical marks of Aristarchus, and (3) Scholia, consisting
                    mainly of extracts from four grammatical works, viz., Didymus (contemporary of
                    Cicero) on the recension of Aristarchus, Aristonicus (fl. 24 <hi

                    A.D.) on the punctuation, of the <hi rend="italic">Hiad.</hi></p>
                <p>These extracts present themselves in two distinct forms. One series of scholia is
                    written in the usual way, on a margin reserved for the purpose. The other
                    consists of brief scholia, written in very small characters (but of the same
                    period) on the narrow space left vacant round the text. Occasionally a scholium
                    of this kind gives the substance of one of the longer extracts; but as a rule
                    they are distinct. It λvould seem, therefore, that after the manuscript was
                    finished the “marginal scholia” were discovered to be extremely defective, and a
                    new series of extracts was added in a form which interfered as little as
                    possible with the appearance of the book.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    exegetical, a collection of which was published by Villoison from a second
                    Venetian MS. in his edition of 1788, and has been again edited by W. Dindorf
                    (Oxford, 1877). The most important collection of this group is contained in the

                    was founded in great measure upon the fresh and abundant materials which it
                    furnished. Not that the “Wolfian theory” of the Homeric poems is directly
                    supported by anything in the Scholia; the immediate object of the <hi

                    elucidate the new and remarkable conditions under which the text of Homer had to
                    be settled, viz., the discovery of an <hi rend="italic">apparatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">criticus</hi> of the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    questions regarding the original structure and early history of the poems were
                    raised (forced upon him, it may be said) by the critical problem; but they were
                    really originated by facts and ideas of a wholly different order.</p>
                <p>The 18th century, in which the spirit of classical correctness had the most
                    absolute dominion, did not come to an end before a powerful reaction set in,
                    which affected not only literature but also speculation and politics. In this
                    movement the leading ideas were concentrated in the word Nature. The natural
                    condition of society, natural law, natural religion, the morality of feeling,
                    the poetry of nature, gained a singular hold, first on the English philosophers
                    from Hume onwards, and then (through Rousseau chiefly) on the general drift of
                    thought and action in Europe. In literature the effect of these ideas was to set
                    up a false opposition between nature and art. As political writers imagined a
                    patriarchal innocence prior to codes of law, so men of letters sought in popular
                    unwritten poetry the freshness and simplicity which were wanting in the
                    prevailing styles. The blind minstrel was the counterpart of the noble savage.
                    The supposed discovery of the poems of Ossian fell in with this train of
                    sentiment, and created an enthusiasm for the study of early popular poetry.
                    Homer was soon drawn into the circle of inquiry. Blackwell (Professor of Greek
                    at Aberdeen) had insisted, in a book published in 1735, on the “naturalness” of
                    Homer; and Wood <hi rend="italic">(Essay on the Original Genius of Homer,</hi>
                    London, 1769) was the first who maintained that Homer composed without the help
                    of writing, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0127-0116"/> and supported his thesis by ancient authority,
                    and also by the parallel of Ossian. Both these books were translated into
                    German, and their ideas passed into the popular philosophy of the day.
                    Everything in short was ripe for the reception of a book that brought together,
                    with masterly ease and vigour, the old and the new Homeric learning, and drew
                    from it the historical proof that Homer was no single poet, writing according to
                    art and rule, but a name which stood for a golden age of the true spontaneous
                    poetry of genius and nature.</p>
                <p>The part of the <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> which deals with the original
                    form of the Homeric poems occupies pp. xl,-clx. (in the first edition). Wolf
                    shows how the question of the date of writing meets us on the threshold of the
                    textual criticism of Homer, and accordingly enters into a full discussion, first
                    of the external evidence, then of the indications furnished by the poems. Having
                    satisfied himself that writing was unknown to Homer, he is led to consider the
                    real mode of transmission, and finds this in the Rhapsodists, of whom the
                    Homeridae were an hereditary school. And then comes the conclusion to which all
                    this has been tending: “the die is cast”—the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> cannot have been composed in the form in which we
                    know them without the aid of writing. They must therefore have been, as Bentley
                    had said, “a sequel of songs and rhapsodies,” “loose songs not collected
                    together in the form of an epic poem till about 500 years after.” This
                    conclusion he then supports by the character attributed to the “Cyclic” poems
                    (whose want of unity showed that the structure of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> must be the work of a later
                    time), by one or two indications of imperfect connexion, and by the doubts of
                    ancient critics as to the genuineness of certain parts. These, however, are
                    matters of conjecture. “Historia loquitur.” The voice of antiquity is unanimous
                    in declaring that “Pisistratus first committed the poems of Homer to writing,
                    and reduced them to the order in which we now read them.</p>
                <p>The appeal of Wolf to the “voice of all antiquity” is by no means borne out by
                    the different statements on the subject. According to Heraclides Ponticus (pupil
                    of Plato), the poetry of Homer was first brought to the Peloponnesus by
                    Lycurgus, who obtained it from the descendants of Creophylus <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Polit.</hi>, fr. 2). Plutarch in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Lycurgus</hi>
                    (c. 4) repeats this story, with the addition that there was already a faint
                    report of the poems in Greece, and that certain detached fragments were in the
                    possession of a few persons <hi rend="italic">(fκiκτηvτo Si</hi><hi

                    Again, the Platonic dialogue <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi> (which though not
                    genuine is probably earlier than the Alexandrian times) asserts that Hipparchus,
                    son of Pisistratus, first brought the poems to Athens, and obliged the
                    rhapsodists at the Panathenaea to follow the order of the text, “as they still
                    do,” instead of reciting portions chosen at will. The earliest authority for
                    attributing any work of the kind to Pisistratus is the well known passage of
                    Cicero <hi rend="italic">{De Oral.,</hi> 3, 34: “Quis doctior eisdem temporibus
                    illis, aut cujus eloquentia litteris instructior fuisse traditur quam
                    Pisistrati? qui primus Homeri libros, confusos antea, sic disposuisse dicitur ut
                    nunc habemus”). To the same effect Pausanias (vii. p. 594) says that the change
                    of the name Donoessa to Gonoessa (in <hi rend="italic">II.</hi> ii. 573) was
                    thought to have been made by ’ ' Pisistratus or one of his companions, when he
                    collected the poems, which were then in a fragmentary condition <hi

                    >μvημoveυ6μeva 1jθpoιζe).</hi> Finally, Diogenes Laertius (i. 57) says that
                    Solon made a law that the poems should be recited with the help of a prompter
                    (∈ξ vπoj8oλi∕s), so that each rhapsodist should begin where the last leit off;
                    and he argues from this that Solon did more than Pisistratus to make Homer
                    known. The argument is directed against a certain Dieuchidas of Megara, who
                    appears to have maintained that the verses about Athens in the Catalogue <hi
                    rend="italic">{Il.</hi> ii. 546-556) were interpolated by Pisistratus. The
                    passage is unfortunately corrupt, but it is at least clear that in the time of
                    Solon, according to Diogenes, there were complete copies of the poems, such as
                    could be used to control the recitations. Hence the account of Diogenes is quite
                    irreconcilable with the notices on which Wolf relied.</p>
                <p>It is needless to examine the attempts which have, been made to harmonize these
                    accounts. Such attempts usually start with the tacit assumption that each of the
                    persons concerned—Lycurgus, Solon, Pisistratus, Hipparchus—must have done <hi
                    rend="italic">something</hi> for the text of Homer, or for the regulation of the
                    rhapsodists. But we have first to consider whether any of the accounts come to
                    us on such evidence that we are bound to consider them as containing a nucleus
                    of truth.</p>
                <p>In the first place, the statement that Lycurgus obtained the poems from
                    descendants of Creophylus must be admitted to be purely mythical. But if we
                    reject it, have we any better reason for believing the parallel assertion in the
                    Platonic <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus l</hi> It is true that Hipparchus is
                    undoubtedly a real person. On the other hand it is evident that the
                    Pisistratidae soon became the subject of many fables. Thucydides notices as a
                    popular mistake the belief that Hipparchus was the eldest son of Pisistratus,
                    and that consequently he was the reigning “tyrant” when he was killed by
                    Aristogiton. The Platonic <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi> follows this
                    erroneous version, and may therefore be regarded as representing (at best) mere
                    local tradition. We may reasonably go further, ami see in this part of the
                    dialogue a piece of historical romance, designed to put the “tyrant” family in a
                    favourable light, as patrons of literature and learning.</p>
                <p>Again, the account of the <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi> is contradicted by
                    Diogenes Laertius, who says that Solon provided for the due recitation of the
                    Homeric poems. The only good authorities as to this point are the orators
                    Lycurgus and Isocrates, who mention the law prescribing the recitation, but do
                    not say when or by whom it was enacted. The inference seems a fair one, that the
                    author of the law was really unknown.</p>
                <p>With regard to the statements which attribute some work in connexion with Homer
                    to Pisistratus, it was noticed by Wolf that Cicero, Pausanias, and the others
                    who mention the matter do so <hi rend="italic">nearly in the same words,</hi>
                    and therefore appear to have drawn from a common source. This source was in all
                    probability an epigram quoted in two of the short lives of Homer, and there said
                    to have been inscribed on the statue of Pisistratus at Athens. In it Pisistratus
                    is made to say of himself that he “collected Homer, who was formerly sung in
                    fragments (0s <hi rend="italic">ri&gt;v</hi><hi rend="italic">"Ομηρον</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i)θpoισa</hi><hi rend="italic">σποράδην</hi><hi rend="italic">τb
                    πρlv aeιδoμevov'),</hi> for the golden poet was a citizen of ours, since we
                    Athenians founded Smyrna.” The other statements repeat these words with various
                    minor additions, chiefly intended to explain how the poems had been reduced to
                    this fragmentary condition, and how Pisistratus set to work to restore them.
                    Thus all the authority for the work of Pisistratus “reduces itself to the
                    testimony of a single anonymous inscription” (Nutzhorn, p. 40). Now, what is the
                    value of that testimony? It is impossible of course to believe that a statue of
                    Pisistratus was set up at Athens in the time of the free republic·. The epigram
                    is almost certainly a mere literary exercise. And what exactly does it say? Only
                    that Homer was <hi rend="italic">recited in fragments</hi> by the rhapsodists,
                    and that these partial recitations were made into a continuous whole by
                    Pisistratus; which does not necessarily mean more than that Pisistratus did what
                    other authorities ascribe to Solon and Hipparchus, viz., regulated the
                    recitation.</p>
                <p>Against the theory which sees in Pisistratus the author of the first complete
                    text of Homer we have to set the absolute silence of Herodotus, Thucydides, the
                    orators, and the Alexandrian grammarians. And it can hardly be thought that
                    their silence is accidental. Herodotus and Thucydides seem to tell us all that
                    they know of Pisistratus. The orators Lycurgus and Isocrates make a great deal
                    of the recitation of Homer at the Panathenaea, but know nothing of the poems
                    having been collected and arranged at Athens, a fact which would have redounded
                    still more to the honour of the city. Finally, the Scholia of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ven. A</hi> contain no reference or allusion to the story of
                    Pisistratus. As these Scholia are derived in substance from the wτitings of
                    Aristarchus, it seems impossible to believe that the story was known to him. The
                    circumstance that it is referred to in the later <hi rend="italic">Scholia
                    Victoriana,</hi> and in Eustathius, gives additional weight to this
                    argument.</p>
                <p>The result of these considerations seems to be that nothing rests on good
                    evidence beyond the fact that Homer was recited by law at the Panathenaic
                    festival. The rest of the story is probably the result of gradual expansion and
                    accretion. It was inevitable that later writers should speculate about the
                    authorship of such a law, and that it should be attributed with more or less
                    confidence to Solon or Pisistratus or Hipparchus. . The choice would be
                    determined in great measure by political feeling. It is probably not an accident
                    that Dieuchidas, who attributed so much to Pisistratus, was a Megarian. The
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Hipparchus</hi> is evidently influenced by the
                    anti-democratical tendencies in which he only followed Plato. In the times to
                    which the story of Pisistratus can be traced, the 1st century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the substitution of the “tyrant” for the legislator
                    λvas extremely natural. It was equally natural that the importance of his work
                    as regards the text of Homer should be exaggerated. The splendid patronage of
                    letters by the successors of Alexander, and especially the great institutions
                    which had been founded at Alexandria and Pergamus, had made an impression on the
                    imagination of learned men which was reflected in the current notions of the
                    ancient despots. It may even be suspected that anecdotes in praise of
                    Pisistratus and Hipparchus were a delicate form of flattery addressed to the
                    reigning Ptolemy. Under these influences the older stories of Lycurgus bringing
                    Homer to the Peloponnesus, and Solon providing for the recitation at Athens,
                    were thrown into the shade.</p>
                <p>In the later Byzantine times it was believed that Pisistratus was aided by
                    seventy grammarians, of whom Zenodotus and Aristarchus were the chief. The great
                    Alexandrian grammarians had become figures in a new mythology. It is true that
                    Tzetzes, one of the writers from whom we have this story, gives a better
                    version, according to which Pisistratus employed four men, viz., Onomacritus.
                    Zopyrus of Heraclea, Orpheus of Croton, and one whose name is corrupt (written
                    <hi rend="italic">eπLκiyκυKos).</hi> Many scholars (among them Ritschl) accept
                    this account as probable. Yet it rests upon no better evidence than the
                    other.</p>
                <p>The effect of the <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> was so overwhelming that,
                    although <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0128-0117"/> a few protests were made at the time, the true
                    Homeric controversy did not begin till after the death of Wolf (1824). His
                    speculations were thoroughly in harmony with the ideas and sentiment of the
                    time, and his historical arguments, especially his long array of testimonies to
                    the work of Pisistratus, were hardly challenged.</p>
                <p>The first considerable antagonist of the Wolfian school was G. W. Nitzsch, whose
                    writings cover the space 1828-1862, and deal with every side of the controversy.
                    In the earlier part of his <hi rend="italic">Meletemata</hi> (1830) he took up
                    the question of written or unwritten literature, on which Wolf’s whole argument
                    turned, and showed that the art of writing must be anterior to Pisistratus. In
                    the later part of the same series of discussions (1837), and in his chief work
                    <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Sagenpoesie der Griechen,</hi>
                    1852), he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems, and their relation to
                    the other epics of the Trojan cycle. These epics had meanwhile been made the
                    subject of a work which for exhaustive learning and delicacy of artistic
                    perception has few rivals in the history of philology, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epic Cycle</hi> of F. G. Weicker. The confusion which previous scholars had
                    made between the ancient post-Homeric poets (Arctinus, Lesches, &amp;c.) and the
                    learned mythological writers (such as the “scriptor cyclicus” of Horace) was
                    first cleared up by Weicker. Wolf had argued that if the cyclic writers had
                    known the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> which
                    we possess, they would have imitated the unity of structure which distinguishes
                    these two poems. The result of Weicker’s labours was to show that the Homeric
                    poems had influenced both the form and the substance of epic poetry.</p>
                <p>In this way there arose a conservative school who admitted more or less freely
                    the absorption of pre-existing lays in the formation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> and also the existence of
                    considerable interpolations, but assigned the main work of formation to
                    prehistoric times, and to the genius of a great poet. Whether the two epics were
                    by the same author remained an open question; the tendency of this group of
                    scholars was decidedly towards separation. Regarding the use of writing too they
                    were not unanimous. K. 0. Miiller, for instance, maintained the view of Wolf on
                    this point, while he strenuously combated the inference which Wolf drew from
                    it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> bore on the title page the words “Volumen
                    I.”; but no second volume ever appeared, nor was any attempt made by Wolf
                    himself to carry his theory further. The first important steps in that direction
                    were taken by Gottfried Hermann, chiefly in two dissertations, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">interpolationibus Homeri</hi> (Leips., 1832), and <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">iteratis Homeri</hi> (Leips., 1840),
                    called forth by the writings of Nitzsch. As the word “interpolation” implies,
                    Heimann did not maintain the hypothesis of a congeries of independent “lays.”
                    Feeling the difficulty of supposing that all the ancient minstrels sang of the
                    “wrath of Achilles” or the “return of Ulysses” (leaving out even the capture of
                    Troy itself), he was led to assume that two poems of no great compass dealing
                    with these two themes became so famous at an early period as to throw other
                    parts of the Trojan into the background, and were then enlarged by successive
                    generations of rhapsodists. Some parts of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi>
                    moreover, seemed to him to be older than the poem on the wrath of Achilles; and
                    thus in addition to the “Homeric” and “post-Homeric” matter he distinguished a
                    “ρre-Homeric” element.</p>
                <p>The conjectures of Hermann, in which the Wolfian theory found a modifie I and
                    tentative application, were presently thrown into the shade by the more
                    trenchant method of La&lt;∙hmann, who (in two papers read to the Berlin Academy
                    in 1837 and 1841) sought to show that the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> was made
                    up of sixteen independent “lays,” with various enlargements and interpolations,
                    all finally reduced to order by Pisistratus. The first book, for instance,
                    consists of a lay on the anger of Achilles (1-347), and two continuations, the
                    return of Chryseis (430-492) and the scenes in Olympus (348-429, 493-611). The
                    second book forms a second lay, but several passages, among them the speech of
                    Ulysses (278-332), are interpolated. In the third book the scenes in which Helen
                    and Priam take part (including the making of the truce) are pronounced to be
                    interpolations; and so on. Regarding the evidence on which these sweeping
                    results are founded, opinions will vary. The degree of smoothness or consistency
                    rvhich is to be expected on the hypothesis of a single author will be determined
                    by taste rather than argument. The dissection of the first book, for instance,
                    turns partly on a chronological inaccuracy which might well escape the poet as
                    well as his hearers. In examining such points we are apt to forget that the
                    contradictions by which a story is shown to be untrue are quite different from
                    those by which a confessedly untrue story would be shown to be the work of
                    different authors.</p>

                <p>Such is the “action” (τrp⅜∖ς) which in Aristotle’s opinion showed the superiority
                    of Horner to all later epic poets. But the proof that his scheme was the work of
                    a great poet does not depend merely upon the artistic unity which excited the
                    wonder of Aristotle. A number of separate “lays” might conceivably be arranged
                    and connected by a man of poetical taste in a manner that would satisfy all
                    requirements. In such a case, however, the connecting passages would be slight
                    and weak. Now, in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> these passages are the finest
                    and most characteristic. The element of connexion and unity is the story of the
                    “wrath of Achilles”; and we have only to look at the books which give the story
                    of the wrath to see how essential they are. Even if the ninth book is rejected
                    (as Grote proposed), there remain the speeches of the first, sixteenth, and
                    nineteenth books. These speeches form the cardinal points in the action of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad—</hi> the framework into which everything else is set;
                    and they have also the best title to the name of Homer.</p>
                <p>The further question, however, remains,—What shorter narrative piece fulfilling
                    the conditions of an independent <pb break="no"

                    the existing <hi rend="italic">Iliad!</hi> It must be admitted that when tried
                    by this test his “lays” generally fail. The “quarrel of the chiefs,” the “muster
                    of the army,” the “duel of Paris and Menelaus,” &amp;c., are excellent
                    beginnings, but have no satisfying conclusion. And the reason is not far to
                    seek. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is not a history, nor is it a series of
                    incidents in the history, of the siege. It turns entirely upon a single
                    incident, occupying a few days only. The several episodes of the poem are not so
                    many distinct stories, each with an interest of its own. They are only parts of
                    a single main event. Consequently the type of epic poem which would be produced
                    by an aggregation of shorter lays is not the type which we have in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Rather the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is itself a
                    single lay which has grown with the growth of poetical art to the dimensions of
                    an epic.</p>
                <p>But the original nucleus and parts of the incidents may be the work of a single
                    great poet, and yet other episodes may be of different authorship, wrought into
                    the structure of the poem in later times. Various theories have been based on
                    this supposition. Grote in particular held that the original poem, which he
                    called the Achilleis, did not include books ii.-vii., ix., x., xxiii., xxiv.
                    Such a view may be defended somewhat as follows.</p>
                <p>Of the books which relate the events during the absence of Achilles from the
                    Greek ranks (ii,-xv.), the last five are directly related to the main action.
                    They describe the successive steps by which the Greeks are driven back, first
                    from the plain to the rampart, then to their ships. Moreover three of the chief
                    heroes, Agamemnon, Diomede, and Ulysses are wounded, and this circumstance, as
                    Lachmann himself admitted, is steadily kept in mind throughout. It is otherwise
                    with the earlier books (especially ii.-vii.). The chief incidents in that part
                    of the poem—the panic rush to the ships, the duels of Paris and Menelaus, and of
                    Hector and Ajax, the Aristeia of Diomede—stand in no relation to the mainspring
                    of the poem, the promise made by Zeus to Thetis. It is true that in the
                    thirteenth and fourteenth books the purpose of Zeus is thwarted for a time by
                    other gods; but in books ii.-vii. it is not so much thwarted as ignored.
                    Further, the events follow without sufficient connexion. The truce of the third
                    book is broken by Pandarus, and Agamemnon passes along the Greek ranks with
                    words of encouragement, but without a hint of the treachery just committed. The
                    Aristeia of Diomede ends in the middle of the sixth book; he is uppermost in all
                    thoughts down to ver. 311, but from this point, in the meetings of Hector with
                    Helen and Andromache, and again in the seventh book when Hector challenges the
                    Greek chiefs, his prowess is forgotten. Once more, some of the incidents seem to
                    belong properly to the beginning of the war. The joy of Menelaus on seeing
                    Paris, Priam’s ignorance of the Greek leaders, the speeches of Agamemnon in his
                    review of the ranks (in book iv.), the building of the wall—all these are in
                    place after the Greek landing, but hardly in the ninth year of the siege.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, it may be said, the second book opens with a direct reference
                    to the events of the first, and the mention of Achilles in the speech of
                    Thersites (ii. 239/1) is sufficient to keep the main course of events in view.
                    The Catalogue is connected with its place in the poem by the lines about
                    Achilles (686-694). When Diomede is at the height of his Aristeia Helenus says
                    (ZZ. vi. 99), “We did not so fear even Achilles.” And when in the third book
                    Priam asks Helen about the Greek captains, or when in the seventh book nine
                    champions come forward to contend with Hector, the want of the greatest hero of
                    all is sufficiently felt. If these passages do not belong to the period of the
                    wrath of Achilles, how are we to account for his conspicuous absence?</p>
                <p>Further, the want of smoothness and unity which is visible in this part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> may be due to other causes than difference of date
                    or authorship. A national poet such as the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> cannot always choose or arrange his matter at his own will. He is
                    bound by the traditions of his art, and by the feelings and expectations of his
                    hearers. The poet who brought the exploits of Diomede into the7‰&lt;7 doubtless
                    had his reasons fordoing so, which were equally strong whether he was the poet
                    of the Achilleis or a later Homer id or rhapsodist. And if some of the incidents
                    (those of the third book in particular) seem to belong to the beginning of the
                    war, it must be considered that poetically, and to the hearers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> the war opens in the third book, and the incidents are
                    of the kind that is required in such a place. The truce makes a pause which
                    heightens the interest of the impending battle; the duel and the scene on the
                    walls are effective in bringing some of the leading characters on the stage, and
                    in making us acquainted with the previous history. The story of Paris and Helen
                    especially, and the general position of affairs in Troy, is put before us in a
                    singularly vivid manner. The book in short forms so good a <hi rend="italic"
                    >prologue</hi> to the action of the war that we can hardly be wrong in
                    attributing it to the genius which devised the rest of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad.</hi></p>
                <p>The case against the remaining books is of a different kind. The ninth and tenth
                    seem like two independent pictures of the night before the great battle of
                    xi.-xvii. Either is enough to fill the space in Homer’s canvas; and the
                    suspicion arises (as when two Platonic dialogues bear the same name) that if
                    either had been genuine, the other would not have come into existence. If one of
                    the two is to be rejected it must be the tenth, which is certainly the less
                    Homeric. It relates a picturesque adventure, conceived in a vein more
                    approaching that of comedy than any other part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad.</hi> Moreover, the language in several places exhibits traces of
                    post-Homeric date. The ninth book, on the other hand, was rejected by Grote,
                    chiefly on the grounds that the embassy to Achilles ought to have put an end to
                    the quarrel, and that it is ignored in later passages, especially in the
                    speeches of Achilles (xi. 609: xvi. 72,85). His argument, however, rests on an
                    assumption which we are apt to bring with us to the reading of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> but which is not borne out by its language, viz., that
                    there was some definite atonement demanded by Achilles, or due to him according
                    to the custom and sentiment of the time. But in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>
                    the whole stress is laid on the anger of Achilles, which can only be satisfied
                    by the defeat and extreme peril of the Greeks.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this point see a paper by Professor
                    Packard in the <hi rend="italic">Trans, of the American Philological

                    nothing else. Accordingly, in the ninth book, when they are still protected by
                    the rampart (see 348 ∕.), he rejects gifts and fair words alike; in the
                    sixteenth he is moved by the tears and entreaties of Patroclus, and the sight of
                    the Greek ships on fire; in the nineteenth his anger is quenched in grief. But
                    he makes no conditions, either in rejecting the offers of the embassy or in
                    returning to the Greek army. And this conduct is the result, not only of his
                    fierce and inexorable character, but also (as the silence of Homer shows) of the
                    want of any general rules or principles, any code of morality or of honour,
                    which would have required him to act in a different way.</p>
                <p>Finally, Grote objected to the two last books that they prolong the action of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> beyond the exigencies of a coherent scheme. Of the
                    two, the twenty-third could more easily be spared. In language, and perhaps in
                    style and manner, it is akin to the tenth; while the twenty-fourth is in the
                    pathetic vein of the ninth, and like it serves to bring out new aspects of the
                    character of Achilles.</p>

                <p>A recent writer (Dr E. Kammer) has given some strong reasons for doubting the
                    genuineness of the passage in book <hi rend="italic">xx.</hi> describing the
                    duel between Achilles and Aeneas (79.-352). The incident is certainly very much
                    out of keeping with the vehement action of that part of the poem, and especially
                    with the moment when Achilles returns to the field, eager to meet Hector and
                    avenge the death of his friend. The interpolation (if it is one) is probably due
                    to local interests. It contains the well-known prophecy that the descendants of
                    Aeneas are to rule over the Trojans,—pointing to the existence of an Aenead
                    dynasty in the Troad. So, too, the legend of Anchises in the Hymn to Aphrodite
                    is evidently local; and Aeneas becomes more prominent in the later epics,
                    especially the <hi rend="italic">Cypria</hi> and the <hi rend="italic

                    >Odyssey,</hi> as in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> the events related fall
                    within a short space of time. The difficulty of adapting the long wanderings of
                    Ulysses to a plan of this type is got over by the device—first met with in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey—</hi> of making the hero tell the story of his own
                    adventures. In this way the action is made to begin almost immediately before
                    the actual return of Ulysses. Up to the time when he reaches Ithaca it moves on
                    three distinct scenes: we follow the fortunes of Ulysses, of Telemachus on his
                    voyage in the Peloponnesus, and of Penelope with the suitors. The art with which
                    these threads are woven together was recognized by Wolf himself, who admitted
                    the difficulty of applying his theory to the <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi>

                    which have been made to dissect the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> the most
                    moderate and attractive is that of Professor A. Kirchoff of Berlin.<note

                <p>According to Kirchoff, the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> as we have it is the
                    result of additions made to an original nucleus. There was first of all a
                    “Return of Odysseus,” relating chiefly the adventures with the Cyclops, Calypso,
                    and the Phaeaciàns; then a continuation, the scene of which lay in Ithaca,
                    embracing the bulk of books xiii.-xxiii. The poem so formed was enlarged at some
                    time between 01. 30 and Ol. 50 by the stories of books x.-xii. (Circe, the
                    Sirens, Scylla, &amp;c.), and the adventures of Telemachus. Lastly, a few
                    passages were interpolated in the time of Pisistratus.</p>
                <p>The proof that the scenes in Ithaca are by a later hand than the ancient “Return”
                    is found chiefly in a contradiction discussed by Kirchoff in his sixth
                    dissertation (pp. 135 ff., ed. 1869). Sometimes Ulysses is represented as aged
                    and worn by toil, so that Penelope, for instance, cannot recognize him;
                    sometimes he is really in the prime of heroic vigour, and his appearing as a
                    beggarly old man is the work of Athene’s wand. The first of these
                    representations is evidently natural, considering the twenty eventful years that
                    have passed; but the second, Kirchoff holds, is the Ulysses of Calypso’s island
                    and the Phaeacian court. He concludes that the aged Ulysses belongs to the
                    “continuation” (the change wrought by Athene’s wand being a device to reconcile
                    the two views), and hence that the continuation is the work of a different
                    author.</p>
                <p>Ingenious as this is, there is really very slender ground for Kirchoff’s thesis.
                    The passages in the second half of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> which
                    describe the appearance of Ulysses do not give <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    well-marked representations of him. Sometimes Athene disguiseshim as a decrepit
                    beggar, sometimes she bestows on him supernatural beauty and vigour. It must be
                    admitted that we are not told exactly how long in each case the effect of these
                    changes lasted. But neither answers to his natural appearance, or to the
                    appearance which he is imagined to present in the earlier books. In the palace
                    of Alcinous, for instance, it is noticed that he is vigorous but “marred by many
                    ills” <hi rend="italic">(κaκohn συvlpρηκτaι πoλeeσσι, Od.</hi> viii. 137) ∙, and
                    this agrees with the scenes of recognition in the latter part of the poem.</p>
                <p>The arguments by which Kirchoff seeks to prove that the stories of books x.-xii.
                    are much later than those of book ix. are not more convincing. He points out
                    some resemblances between these three books and the Argonautic fables, among
                    them the circumstance that a fountain Artacia occurs in both. In the Argonautic
                    story this fountain is placed in the neighbourhood of Cyzicus, and answers to an
                    actual fountain known in historical times. Kirchoff argues that the Artacia of
                    the Argonautic story must have been taken from the real Artacia, and the Artacia
                    of the Odyssey again from that of the Argonautic story. And as Cyzicus was
                    settled from Miletus, he infers that both sets of stories must be comparatively
                    late. It is more probable, surely, that the name Artacia occurred independently
                    (as most geographical names are found to occur) in more than one place. Or it
                    may be that the Artacia of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> suggested the name
                    to the colonists of Cyzicus, whence it was adopted into the later versions of
                    the Argonautic story. The further argument that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nostoi</hi> recognized a son of Calypso by Ulysses but no son °f Circe,
                    consequently that Circe was unknown to the poet of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nostoi,</hi> rests (in the first place) upon a conjectural alteration of a
                    passage in Eustathius, and moreover has all the weakness of an argument from
                    silence, in addition to the uncertainty arising from our very slight knowledge
                    of the author whose silence is in question. Finally, when Kirchoff finds traces
                    in books x.-xii. of their having been originally told by the poet himself
                    instead of being put in the mouth of his hero, we feel that inaccuracies of this
                    kind are apt to creep in whenever a fictitious story is thrown into the form of
                    an autobiography.</p>
                <p>Inquiries conducted with the refinement which characterizes those of Kirchoff are
                    always instructive, and his book contains very many just observations; but it is
                    impossible to admit his main conclusions. And perhaps we may infer that no
                    similar attempt can be more successful. It does not indeed follow that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> is free from interpolations. The Neκυlα of book xi.
                    may be later (..s Lauer maintained), or it may contain additions, which could
                    easily be inserted in a description of the kind. And the last book is probably
                    by a different hand, as the ancient critics believed. But the unity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> as a whole is apparently beyond the reach of the
                    existing weapons of criticism.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chorizontes.—</hi> ΛVhen we are satisfied that each of the
                    great Homeric poems is either wholly or mainly the work of a single poet, a
                    question remains which has been matter of controversy in ancient as well as
                    modern times—Are they the work of the same poet? Two ancient grammarians, Xeno
                    and Hellanicus, were known as the separators (oi χωρι£οντες); and Aristarchus
                    appears to have written a treatise against their heresy. In modern times some of
                    the greatest names have been on the side of the “Chorizontes.”</p>
                <p>If, as has been maintained in the preceding pages, the external evidence
                    regarding Homer is of no value, the problem now before us may be stated in this
                    form Given two poems of which nothing is known except that they are of the same
                    school of poetry, what is the probability that they are by the same author? We
                    may find a fair parallel by imagining two plays drawn at hazard from the works
                    of the great tragic writers. It is evident that the burden of proof would rest
                    with those who held them to be by the same hand.</p>
                <p>The arguments used in this discussion have been of very various calibre. The
                    ancient Chorizontes observed that the messenger of Zeus is Iris in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> but Hermes in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>; that
                    the wife of Hephaestus is one of the Charites in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> but Aphrodite in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>; that the
                    heroes in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> do not eat fish; that Crete has a
                    hundred cities according to the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and only ninety
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>; that τrpo7rαpoι0∈ is used in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> of place, in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>
                    of time, &amp;c. Modem scholars have added to the list, especially by making
                    careful comparisons of the two poems in respect of vocabulary and grammatical
                    forms. Nothing is more difficult than to assign the degree of weight to be given
                    to such facts. The difference of subject between the two poems is so great that
                    it leads to the most striking differences of detail, especially in the
                    vocabulary. For instance, the word <hi rend="italic">φόβος,</hi> which in Homer
                    means “flight in battle” (not “fear”), occurs thirty-nine times in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and only once in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>;
                    but then there are no battles in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> Again, the
                    verb pj)γvυ∕ιι, <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> to break,” occurs forty-eight
                    times in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and once in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey,—</hi> the reason being that it is constantly used of breaking the
                    armour of an enemy, the gate of a city, the hostile ranks, &amp;c. Once more,
                    the word σκότος, “darkness,” occurs fourteen times in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Had,</hi> once in tho <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> But in every one of the
                    fourteen places it is used of “darkness” coming over the sight of a fallen
                    warrior. On the other side, if words such as <hi rend="italic">άσάμινθος,</hi>
                    “a bath, ’ <hi rend="italic">χipvιψ,</hi> “a basin for the hands,” <hi
                    rend="italic">λdσχy,</hi> “a place to meet and talk,” &lt;fcc., are peculiar to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> we have only to remember that the scene in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is hardly ever laid <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n131/mode/1up"

                    examples will show that mere statistics of the occurrence of words prove little,
                    and that we must begin by looking to the subject and character of each poem.
                    When we do so, we at once find ourselves in the presence of differences of the
                    broadest kind. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is much more historical in tone
                    aud character. The scene of the poem is a real place, and the poet sings (as
                    Ulysses says of Demodocus) as though he had been present himself, or had heard
                    from one who had been. The supernatural element is confined to an interference
                    of the gods, which to the common eye hardly disturbs the natural current of
                    affairs. The <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> on the contrary, is full of the
                    magical and romantic—“speciosa miracula,” as Horace called them. Moreover, these
                    marvels —which in their original form are doubtless as old as anything in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> since in fact they are part of the vast stock of
                    popular tales <hi rend="italic">(Märchen)</hi> diffused all over the world—are
                    mixed up in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> with the heroes of the Trojan
                    war. This has been especially noticed in the case of the story of Polyphemus,
                    one that is found in many countries, and in versions which cannot all be derived
                    from Homer. W. Grimm has pointed out that the behaviour of Ulysses in that story
                    is senseless and foolhardy, utterly beneath the wise and much-enduring Ulysses
                    of the Trojan war. The reason is simple; he is not the same Ulysses, but a being
                    of the same world as Polyphemus himself—the world of giants aud ogres. The
                    question then is—How long must the name of Ulysses have been familiar in the
                    legend <hi rend="italic">(Sage)</hi> of Troy before it made its way into the
                    tales of giants and ogres <hi rend="italic">(Märchen),</hi> where the poet of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> found it?</p>
                <p>Again, the Trojan legend has itself received some extension between the time of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and that of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi>
                    The story of the Wooden Horse is not only unknown to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> but is of a kind which we can hardly imagine the poet of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> admitting. The part taken by Neoptolemus seems also to
                    be a later addition. The tendency to amplify and complete the story shows itself
                    still more in the Cyclic poets. Between the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and
                    these poets the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> often occupies an intermediate
                    position.</p>
                <p>This great and significant change in the treatment of the heroic legends is
                    accompanied by numerous minor differences (such as the ancients remarked) in
                    belief, in manners and institutions, and in language. These differences bear out
                    the inference th it the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> is of a later age. The
                    progress of reflexion is especially shown in the higher ideas entertained
                    regarding the gods. The turbulent Olympian court has almost disappeared. Zeus
                    has acquired the character of a supreme moral ruler; and although Athene and
                    Poseidon are adverse influences in the poem, the notion of a direct contest
                    between them is scrupulously avoided. The advance of morality is shown in the
                    more frequent use of terms such as “just” (δίκαιος), “piety” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(oσiη),</hi> “insolence” <hi rend="italic">(vβpLf),</hi> “god-fearing”
                    (0εoυδι∕ς), “pure” (αγνός); aid also in the plot of the story, which is
                    distinctly a contest between right and wrong. In matters bearing upon the arts
                    of life it is unsafe to press the silence of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi>
                    We may note, however, the difference between the house of Priam, surrounded by
                    distinct dwellings for his many sons and daughters, and the houses of Ulysses
                    and Alcinous, with many chambers under a single roof. The singer, too, who is so
                    prominent a figure in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> can hardly be thought
                    to be absent from the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> merely because the scene is
                    laid in a camp.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Style of Homer.—A.</hi> few <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> words
                    remain to be said on the style and general character of the Homeric poems, and
                    on the comparisons which may be made between Homer and analogous poetry in other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The cardinal qualities of the style of Homer have been pointed out once for all
                    by Mr Matthew Arnold. “The translator of Homer,” he says, “should above all be
                    penetrated by a sense of four qualities of his author—that he is eminently
                    rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his
                    thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his
                    words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought,
                    that is, in his matter and ideas; and finally, that he is eminently noble” <hi
                    rend="italic">(On Translating Homer,</hi> p. 9).</p>
                <p>The peculiar rapidity of Homer is due in great measure to his use of the
                    hexameter verse. It is characteristic of early literature that the evolution of
                    the thought—that is, the grammatical form of the sentence—is guided by the
                    structure of the verse; and the correspondence which consequently obtains
                    between the rhythm and the grammar—· the thought being given out in lengths, as
                    it were, and these again divided by tolerably uniform pauses—produces a swift
                    flowing movement, such as is rarely found when the periods have been constructed
                    without direct reference to the metre. That Homer possesses this rapidity
                    without falling into the corresponding faults—that is, without becoming either
                    “jerky” or monotonous—is perhaps the best proof of his unequalled poetical
                    skill. The plainness and directness, both of thought and of expression, which
                    characterize Homer were doubtless qualities of his age; but the author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (like Voltaire, to whom Mr Arnold happily compares
                    him) must have possessed the national gift in a surpassing degree. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> is in this respect perceptibly below the level of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi></p>
                <p>Rapidity or ease of movement, plainness of expression, and plainness of thought,
                    these are not the distinguishing qualities of the great epic poets—Virgil,
                    Dante, Milton. On the contrary, they belong rather to the humbler epico-lyrical
                    school for which Homer has been so often claimed. The proof that Homer does not
                    belong to that school— that his poetry is not in any true sense “ballad-poetry
                    ”— is furnished by the higher artistic structure of his poems (already
                    discussed), and as regards style by the fourth of the qualities distinguished by
                    Mr Arnold—the quality of <hi rend="italic">nobleness.</hi> It is his noble and
                    powerful style, sustained through every change of idea and subject, that finally
                    separates Homer from all forms of “ballad-poetry” and “popular epic.”<note

                <p>But while we are on our guard against a once common error, we may recognize the

                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> and the “ballad” literature which undoubtedly
                    preceded them in Greece. It may even be admitted that the swift-flowing
                    movement, and the simplicity of thought and style, which we admire in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> are an inheritance from the earlier “lays —the κλeα
                    avδρ&lt;tv such as Achilles and Patroclus sang to the lyre in their tent. Even
                    the metre—the hexameter verse—may be assigned to them. But between these lays
                    and Homer we must place the cultivation of epic poetry as an art.<note

                <p>A single example will illustrate this. In the scene on the walls of Troy, in the

                    Agamemnon, Ulysses, and Ajax in answer to Priam’s questions, she goes on unasked
                    to name Idomeneus. Lachmann, whose mind is full of the ballad manner, fastens
                    upon this as an irregularity. “The unskil-fui<pb break="no"

                    >(Histoire poétique</hi><hi rend="italic">de Charlemagne,</hi> p. 9), the
                    national songs have been arrested in a form which may be called intermediate
                    between contemporary poetry and the epic. The true epics are those of India,
                    Persia, Greece, Germany, Britain, and France. Most of these, however, fail to
                    afford any useful points of comparison, either from their utter unlikeness to
                    Homer, or because there is no evidence of the existence of anterior popular
                    songs. The most instructive, perhaps the only instructive, parallel is tobe
                    found in the French “chansons de geste,” of which the <hi rend="italic">Chanson
                    de Roland</hi> is the earliest and best example. These poems are traced back
                    with much probability to the 10th century. They are epic in character, and were
                    recited by professional <hi rend="italic">jongleurs</hi> (who may be compared to
                    the άοιδοί of Homer). But as early as the 7th century we come upon traces of
                    short lays (the so-called cantilènes) which were in the mouths of all, and were
                    sung in chorus. It has been held that the chansons de geste were formed by
                    joining together “bunches” of these earlier cantilènes, and this was the view
                    taken by M. Léon Gautier in the first edition of his great work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Épopées françaises,</hi> published in 1865. Tn the second
                    edition, of which the first volume appeared in 1878, he has abandoned this
                    theory. He still believes that the epics were generally composed under the
                    influence of earlier songs. “Our first epic poets,” he now says, “did not
                    actually and materially patch together pre-existent cantilènes. They were only
                    inspired by these popular songs; they only borrowed from them the traditional
                    and legendary elements. In short, they took nothing from them but the ideas, the
                    spirit, the life; they ‘ found ’ (ils ont trouvé) all the rest” (p. 80). But he
                    admits that “some of the old poems may have been borrowed from tradition,
                    without any intermediary” <hi rend="italic">(ibicl.)∙,</hi> and when it is
                    considered that the traces of the “cantilènes” are slight, and that the degree
                    in which they inspired the later poetry must be a matter of impression rather
                    than of proof, it does not surprise us to find other scholars (notably M. Paul
                    Meyer) attaching less importance to them, or even doubting their existence.<note

                    peculiar degradation of Homeric characters which appears in some poets
                    (especially Euripides) finds a parallel in the later chansons de geste.<note

                <p>The comparison of Homer with the great literary epics calls for more discursive
                    treatment than would be in place here. Some external differences have been
                    already indicated. Like the French epics, Homeric poetry is indigenous, and is
                    distinguished by this fact, and by the ease of movement and the simplicity which
                    result from it, from poets such as Virgil, Dante, and Milton. It is also
                    distinguished from them by the comparative absence of underlying motive or
                    sentiment. In Virgil’s poetry a sense of the greatness of Rome and Italy is the
                    leading motive of a passionate rhetoric, partly veiled by the “chosen delicacy”
                    of his language. Dante and Milton are still more faithful exponents of the
                    religion and politics of their time. Even the French epics are pervaded by the
                    sentiment of fear and hatred of the Saracens. But in Homer the interest is
                    purely dramatic. There is no strong antipathy of race or religion; the war turns
                    on no political event; the capture of Troy lies outside the range of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Even the heroes are not the chief national heroes of
                    Greece. The interest lies wholly (so far as we can see) in the picture of human
                    action and feeling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bibliography.—</hi> A complete bibliography of Homer would fill
                    volumes. The following list is intended to include those books only which are of
                    first-rate importance, or which would be found of use to a student at the
                    present time.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Homer,
                    published at Florence in 1488, by Demetrius Chalcondylas, and the Aldine
                    editions of 1504 and 1517, have still some value beyond that of curiosity. The
                    chief modern critical editions are those of Wolf (Halle, 1794-95; Leipsic,
                    1804-7), Spitzner (Gotha, 1832-36), Bekkeι ’ (Berlin, 1843; Bonn, 1858), and La

                    1873-76, both at Leipsic). The commentaries of Barnes, Clarke, and Ernesti are
                    practically superseded; but Heyne’s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (Leipsic,
                    1802), and Nitzsch’s commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (books
                    i.-xii., Hanover, 1826-40) are still useful. Nägelbach’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anmerkungen zur</hi><hi rend="italic">Ilias</hi> (A,B 1-483, Γ) is of great
                    value, especially the third edition (by Autenrieth, Nuremberg, 1864). The school
                    editions of Faesi, Ameis, and La Roche should be added to the corresponding
                    English books. The unique <hi rend="italic">Scholia Veneta</hi> on the <hi

                    were published by Buttmann (Berlin, 1821), and with greater approach to
                    completeness by W. Dindorf (Oxford, 1855). Although Wolf at once perceived the
                    value of the Venetian Scholia on the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> the first
