                    a large number of birds, some of which, perhaps, have no intimate affinity; but
                    here to be used, as before in this work <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol.
                    iii. p. 739), in a more restricted sense for what, in the opinion of a good many

                    rend="italic">Meliphagidoe</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> excluding therefrom the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hecta-</hi><hi rend="italic">riniidoe</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sun-birds</hi> (which see) as well as the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Promerops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zoster ops</hi> with whatever
                    allies they may possess. Even with this restriction, the extent of the Family
                    must be regarded as very indefinite, owing to the absence of materials
                    sufficient for arriving at a satisfactory conclusion, though the existence of
                    such a Family is probably indisputable. Making allowance then for the imperfect
                    light in which they must at present be viewed, what are here called <hi
                    rend="italic">Meliphagidoe</hi> include some of the most characteristic forms of
                    the ornithology of the great Australian Region—members of the. Family inhabiting
                    almost every part of it, and a single species only, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ptilotis</hi><hi rend="italic">limbata,</hi> being said to occur outside its
                    limits. They all possess, or are supposed to possess, a long protrusible tongue
                    with a brushlike tip, differing, it is believed, in structure from that found in
                    any other bird,— <hi rend="italic">Promerops</hi> perhaps excepted,— and capable
                    of being formed into a suctorial tube, by means of which honey is absorbed from
                    the nectary of flowers, though it would seem that insects attracted by the honey
                    furnish the chief nourishment of many species, while others undoubtedly feed to
                    a greater or less extent on fruits. The <hi rend="italic">Meliphagidoe,</hi> as
                    now considered, are for the most part small birds, never exceeding the size of a
                    Mistletoe Thrush; and they have been divided into more than 20 genera,
                    containing above 200 species, of which only a few can here be particularized.
                    Most of these species have a very confined range, being found perhaps only on a
                    single island or group of islands in the Region, but there are a few which are
                    more widely distributed—such as <hi rend="italic">Glycyphila rιιfifrons,</hi>
                    the White-throated<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    may be remarked that the young of this species has the throat yellow.</p></note>
                    Honey-eater, found over the greater part of Australia and Tasmania. In plumage
                    they vary much. Most of the species of <hi rend="italic">Ptilotis</hi> are
                    characterized by a tuft of white, or in others of yellow, feathers springing
                    from behind the ear. In the greater number of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myzomela</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr W. A.

                    rend="italic">?</hi> the males are recognizable by a gorgeous display of crimson
                    or scarlet, which has caused one species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sanguinolenta,</hi> to be known as the Soldier-bird to Australian
                    colonists; but in others no brilliant colour appears, and those of several
                    genera have no special ornamentation, while some have a particularly plain
                    appearance. One of the most curious forms is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prosthemadera—</hi> the Tui or Parson-bird of New Zealand, so called from the
                    two tufts of white feathers which hang beneath its chin in great contrast to its
                    dark silky plumage, and suggest a likeness to the bands worn by ministers of
                    several religious denominations when officiating.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This bird, according to Mr Buller <hi
                    rend="italic">{Birds of New Zealand,</hi> p. 88), while uttering its wild notes,
                    indulges in much gesticulation, which adds to the suggested resemblance. It has
                    great power of mimicry, and is a favourite cage-bird both with the natives and
                    colonists. On one occasion, says this gentleman, he had addressed a large
                    meeting of Maories on a matter of considerable political importance, when
                    “immediately on the conclusion of my speech, and before the old chief to whom my
                    arguments were chiefly addressed had time to reply, a Tui, whose netted cage
                    hung to a rafter overhead, responded in a clear emphatic way, ‘ Tito! ’ (false).
                    The circumstance naturally caused much merriment among my audience, and quite
                    upset the gravity of the venerable old chief Nepia Taratoa. ’ Friend,’ said he,
                    laughing, ‘ your arguments are very good; but my <hi rend="italic">mokai is</hi>
                    a very wise bird, and he is not yet convinced! ’”</p></note> The Bell-bird of
                    the same island, <hi rend="italic">Anthorιιis melaηura—</hi> whose melody
                    excited the admiration of Cook the morning after he had anchored in Queen
                    Charlotte’s Sound—is another member of this Family, and unfortunately seems to
                    be fast becoming extinct. But it would be impossible here to enter much further
                    into detail, though the Wattle-birds, <hi rend="italic">Anthochoera,</hi> of
                    Australia have at least to be named. Mention, however, must be made of the
                    Friar-birds, <hi rend="italic">Tropidorhynchus,</hi> of which nearly a score of
                    species, five of them belonging to Australia, have been described. With their
                    stout bills, mostly surmounted by an excrescence, they seem to be the most
                    abnormal forms of the Family, and most of them are besides remarkable for the
                    baldness of some part at least of their head. They assemble in troops, sitting
                    on dead trees, with a loud call, and are very pugnacious, frequently driving
                    away Hawks and Crows. Mr Wallace <hi rend="italic">{Malay Archipelago,</hi> ii.
                    pp. 150- 153) discovered the curious fact that two species of this genus,— <hi
                    rend="italic">P. bourensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. subcornutus,—</hi>
                    respectively inhabiting the islands of Bouru and Ceram, were the object of
                    natural “mimicry” on the part of two species of Oriole of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Mimeta, Μ. bouroueηsis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    forsteni,</hi> inhabiting the same islands, so as to be on a superficial
                    examination identical in appearance,—the Honey-eater and the Oriole of each
                    island presenting exactly the same tints, —the black patch of bare skin round
                    the eyes of the former, for instance, being copied in the latter by a patch of
                    black feathers and even the protuberance on the beak of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tropidorhynchus</hi> being imitated by a similar enlargement of the beak of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mimeta.</hi> The very reasonable explanation which Mr Wallace
                    offers is that the pugnacity of the former has led the smaller Birds-of-prey to
                    respect it, and it is therefore an advantage for the latter, being weaker and
                    less courageous, to be mistaken for it. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
