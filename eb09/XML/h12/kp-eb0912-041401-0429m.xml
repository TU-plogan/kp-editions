                    coal-works in the neighbourhood, and died in June 1742; but his mother’s second
                    husband, Francis Fraim, proved kind to the boy,, and, in consequence of a slight
                    accident to the elbow-joint of his right arm, sent him to school while his
                    brothers worked in the pits. The most of his education he received in a school
                    at Jesmond, kept by Mr Ivison, a clergyman of the church of England. There is
                    reason to believe, on the evidence of two pay-bills, that for a short time in
                    1755 and 1756 Hutton worked in Old Long Benton colliery; at any rate, on
                    Ivison’s promotion to a living, Hutton succeeded to the Jesmond school, whence,
                    in consequence of increasing pupils, he removed to Stote’s Hall. While he taught
                    during the day at Stote’s H ill, he studied mathematics in the evening at a
                    school in Newcastle. In 1760 he married, and began the work of tuition on a
                    larger scale in Newcastle, where he had among his pupils John Scott, afterwards
                    Lord Eldon, chancellor of England. In 1764 he published his first work, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Schoolmaster's Guide, or a Complete System of Practical
                    Arithmetic,</hi> which in 1770 was followed by his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Mensuration both in Theory and Practice.</hi> In 17 72 appeared a tract on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Principles of Bridges,</hi> suggested by the destruction of
                    Newcastle bridge by a high flood on 17 th November 1771. On a vacancy occurring
                    in the professorship of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in
                    1773, Hutton became a candidate, and after a severe competitive contest was
                    appointed to the post. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1774, and at
                    their request drew up an account of the calculations to determine the mean
                    density and mass of the earth made by him from the measurements taken in 1774-76
                    at Schiehallion in Perthshire. This account appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1778, was afterwards reprinted in the
                    second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Tracts on Mathematical and Philosophical
                    Subjects,</hi> and procured for Hutton the degree of LL.D, from the university
                    of Edinburgh. He was elected foreign secretary to the Royal Society in 1779, but
                    his resignation in 1783 was brought about by the president Sir Joseph Banks,
                    whose behaviour to the mathematical section of the society was somewhat
                    high-handed (see Kippis’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on the late Contests in
                    the Royal Society,</hi> London, 1784). After his <hi rend="italic">Tables of the
                    Products and Powers of Numbers,</hi> 1781, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematical Tables,</hi> 1785, he issued, for the use of the Royal Military
                    Academy, in 1787 <hi rend="italic">Elements of Conic Sections,</hi> and in 1798
                    his <hi rend="italic">Course of Mathematics.</hi> The last, at the time it
                    appeared, was much superior in mode of treatment to any existing work on the
                    subject, and in succeeding editions the author incorporated many new discoveries
                    and methods. The two volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical and
                    Philosophical Dictionary,</hi> a most valuable contribution to scientific
                    biography, were published in 1795, and the four volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recreations in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy,</hi> mostly a translation
                    from the French, in 1803. One of the most laborious of his works was the
                    abridgment, in conjunction with Drs Shaw and Pearson, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions.</hi> This undertaking, the mathematical and
                    scientific parts of which fell to Hutton’s share, was completed in 1809, and
                    filled eighteen volumes quarto. Hutton’s long-continued connexion (it extended
                    over fifty-six years) with the mathematical periodicals of his time, whether as
                    contributor or editor, deserves a word of notice. His name first appears in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Diary</hi> (a poetical and mathematical almanac which
                    was begun in 1704, lasted on till 1871, and which “contributed more to the study
                    and improvement of mathematics than half the books professedly written on the
                    subject”) in the year 1764; ten years later he was appointed editor of the
                    almanac, a post which he retained till 1817. Previous to his editorship of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi> he had begun a small periodical, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellanea</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematica,</hi> which extended only to
                    thirteen numbers; subsequently to it, he published in five volumes <hi
                    rend="italic">The Diariaη Miscellany,</hi> which consisted of all the useful and
                    entertaining parts of the <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> down to 1773, with many
                    additional solutions and improvements. On the resignation, owing to failing
                    health, of his professorship in 1807, he was allowed a pension of £500 a year.
                    He died on 27th January 1823.</p>
                <p>All the biographical notices of Hutton are unanimous in describing him as one of
                    the most skilful of teachers, and the most amiable of men. His modesty and
                    simplicity were as remarkable as his intellectual gifts. To his friends and
                    pupils he exhibited a warmth of personal affection that attached both to him in
                    a very rare degree. It was also with him a sacred duty to seek out the poor and
                    unbefriended student of science, and promote and otherwise assist him to the
                    best of his power.</p>
