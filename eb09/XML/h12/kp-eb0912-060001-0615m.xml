                <p><label type="entry">HYSTERIA</label>, a term applied to a disordered condition of
                    the nervous system, the anatomical seat and nature of which are unknown to
                    medical science, but of which the symptoms consist in well-marked and very
                    varied disturbances of nerve function. By the ancients and by modern physicians
                    down to the time of Sydenham its symptoms were supposed to be due to
                    disturbances of the uterus (ύστερα, whence the name), but it is now universally
                    recognized that they are dependent on a variety of causes with which that organ
                    has no neces sary connexion. The causes of hysteria may be divided into the
                    predisposing, such as hereditary predisposition to nervous degeneration, sex,
                    age, occupation, and national idiosyncracy; and the immediate, such as mental
                    and physical exhaustion, fright, and other emotional influences, pregnancy, the
                    puerperal condition, diseases of the uterus and its appendages, and the
                    depressing influence of injury or general disease. Each and all of these causes
                    may act and react in any given case; in fact, it is nearly always impossible to
                    assign a particular cause in a particular instance. Perhaps, taken over all,
                    hereditary predisposition to nerve-instability may be asserted as the most
                    prolific cause. It is often noticed in families in which this instability exists
                    that hysteria presents itself to a greater or less extent in a considerable
                    number of its members as the sole indication of the diathesis. As regards age
                    the condition is apt to appear at the evolutional periods of life—puberty,
                    pregnancy, and the climacteric—without any further assignable cause except that
                    first spoken of. It is very frequent in girls between the ages of twelve and
                    fifteen, and in women on the cessation of the menstrual flow. It is much more
                    common in the female than the male,—in the proportion of 20 to 1,—which
                    circumstance points to the important influence of the uterus in causation, but
                    definitely places hysteria in the category of nervous diseases. It has been
                    asserted that certain races are more liable to the disease than others—that for
                    instance the Latins and the Slavs are more prone io it than other inhabitants of
                    Europe. This, however, is doubtful; in the more excitable races we find on the
                    whole a greater tendency to hysterical excitement, in those whose national
                    characteristic is calm and impassionateness a tendency to hysterical depression;
                    and it is probable that the greater prominence of the symptoms in the former may
                    have masked the more subtle yet not less important manifestations of the disease
                    presented in the latter. Occupation, or be it rather said want of occupation, is
                    a prolific cause. This is noticeable in all classes of society: in the higher
                    the idle luxurious woman concentrates herself upon herself, and the frivolity of
                    her existence helps to aggravate the evil which may be innate in her
                    constitution; in the lower classes the disease is not so prevalent except among
                    women who live a vicious and excited life. The experience of prison authorities
                    shows not only that women of the criminal classes are individually liable to the
                    hysterical paroxysm, but that it is very apt to assume an epidemic form amongst
                    them. There is no proof that any particular legitimate occupation tends toits
                    development. The depressing effects of almost any disease may be directly
                    productive of hysteria, more especially those accompanied by pain and loss of
                    sleep. There can be little doubt, however, that disease of the uterus and its
                    appendages has a greater tendency towards its production than disease of any
                    other system. At the same time, hysteria seems to follow more frequently on the
                    less severe than on the graver forms of uterine complaints.</p>
                <p>In point of duration hysteria may be transient or chronic. In the first phase it
                    consists of an explosion of emotionalism, generally the result of mental
                    excitement, to which the popular term “hysterics” is applied. Such attacks are
                    generally preceded and accompanied by a sensation of a lump in the throat (the
                    “globus hystericus ”), a flow of limpid urine, violent outbursts of alternate
                    laughter and weeping, and sometimes even convulsion. In the chronic condition we
                    find an extraordinary complexity of symptoms, both physical and mental. These
                    are continuous, constituting the “status hystericus,” and paroxysmal. The
                    physical symptoms are extremely diverse: there may be a pseudoparalysis, the
                    patient lying palsied wholly or partially, or there may be rigidity of one or
                    more limbs, in either case the symptom persisting for weeks or months or even
                    years; there may be flushing or pallor of the face, an increase or decrease of
                    temperature. Perversions of sensation are frequent symptoms; these consist in
                    complaint of pain, generally of a local character: a common instance is the
                    sensation of a nail being driven through the vertex of the head (“clavus
                    hystericus ”), or of increased sensibility of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n616/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0616-0601"/> particular parts. On the other hand loss of
                    sensation may be complained of, or, as occasionally happens, hyperaesthesia and
                    anaesthesia may be stated by an individual to exist in different parts of the
                    body. The region of the spine is a very frequent seat of hysterical pain. Pain,
                    more especially when referred to a joint, is apt to be accompanied by swelling.
                    Both the motor and the sensory symptoms are in every instance out of all
                    proportion to any assignable cause, and for the most part disappear suddenly,
                    leaving the patient in perfect health. It is to such cases that the wonderful
                    cures effected by quacks and charlatans may be referred. The mental symptoms
                    have not the same tendency to pass away suddenly. They may be spoken of as
                    interparoxysmal and paroxysmal. The chief characteristics of the former are
                    extreme emotionalism combined with a curious obstructiveness, a desire to be an
                    object of importance, and a constant craving for sympathy. This is sought to be
                    procured at an immense sacrifice of personal comfort, and to this may be
                    referred a very large proportion of the motor and sensory symptoms above spoken
                    of. The paroxysmal condition does not materially differ from the transient
                    hysteric attack, except that convulsion is more common and more violent. The
                    special senses of taste, sight, and hearing may be affected, sometimes
                    temporarily obliterated. Hysteria may pass into absolute insanity.</p>
                <p>Treatment consists in attention to the general health, and to such special
                    symptoms as may arise, notably those connected with the function of
                    menstruation. The submission of the patient to the best moral influences is of
                    no mean importance. But it may be admitted that the results are generally
                    unsatisfactory so far as medication is concerned, as the cure is usually
                    spontaneous or dependent on some sudden mental influence.</p>
