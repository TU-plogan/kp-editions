                <p><label type="entry">HYMENOPTERA</label><hi rend="italic">(the Piezata</hi> of
                    Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Hautflüger</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aderflüger</hi> in German), an order of <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> (so
                    named from their wings being joined, as hereafter described) containing the
                    insects commonly called bees, wasps,, ants, ichneumons, gall-flies, saw-flies,
                    and others less known which have received no English names. The main
                    characteristics of the order are these :—the possession of four wings, of which
                    the anterior are always larger than the posterior, always of the same texture,
                    and mostly with nervures arranged in regular patterns; a dense hard skin,
                    smooth, shining, or very hairy; a mouth always provided with mandibles adapted
                    for biting, though the other mouth parts may be so modified as to serve for
                    mastication, or for the sucking, or rather lapping, of liquids. The female is
                    provided with an anal instrument connected with oviposition, and sometimes
                    serving for defence, in which case it is in communication with a poison gland.
                    They undergo a regular transformation, and have larvae provided with legs on the
                    thorax and abdomen, or on the former part only, or (as is more often the case)
                    entirely footless.</p>
                <p>The wings have few nervures, and may be even entirely devoid of them; when
                    present they proceed from the base of the wing, or from the costa (the part
                    which bounds the wing in front) towards the apex, which they may or may not
                    reach. Connected with the lateral nervures are others (recurrent nervures) which
                    unite them together, and form in this way regular cellules. The first two
                    lateral nervures (those nearest the top) are the most important, and are called
                    the “marginal” and “submarginal” respectively. The cellules which they form by
                    means of the cross or recurrent nervures are called the “marginal” and
                    “submarginal cellules.” Not unfrequently there is, towards the apical third of
                    the costa, a thickened spot (considered by some to act as a counterpoise when
                    the insect is flying) termed the “stigma” or “pterostigma.” It is not always
                    present, however, and when present may be very small, or, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pachylosticα, Nexγ</hi> large and projecting. In a similar way the
                    hind wing may contain lateral and cross nervures, but they are fewer in number
                    and in importance, and may bè entirely absent, although present in the larger
                    pair. The arrangement of the nervures in the <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi>
                    undergoes, in the various families, great diversity; and, what is of great
                    importance in classification, their form, in the different families, and even
                    genera, is, within certain limits, remarkably constant. On this account great
                    attention has been paid to them; and each nervure and cellule has received a
                    distinct name. The use of the nervures and cellules does not lead to the
                    formation of artificial groups; for we find that the existence of a particular
                    arrangement of the nervures in a hymenopterous insect denotes the presence of
                    other characters. Each family indeed has its own form of wing, as will be seen
                    from the accompanying figures. The relative value, however, of the neuration in
                    classification is not always the same. It is of much greater importance, for
                    instance, with saw-flies than with bees. The wings are usually shorter than the
                    body, and may be so short as to be useless for flight; they may be even entirely
                    absent. Apterous species are found in almost all the families. In most cases it
                    is the females only which are thus deprived of the power of flight. But the
                    opposite of this may exist; as, for instance, with a curious species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididoe</hi> which lives in'the nest of bees as a parasite.
                    With ants, again, the neuters are always wingless; and the females lose their
                    wings when they commence the formation of a colony. It is worthy of remark, too,
                    that some <hi rend="italic">Chαlci∙</hi><pb break="no"

                    >Oxyura,</hi> which are normally winged, occasionally appear in an apterous or
                    semi-apterous condition. On the anterior margin of the hind wings are placed a
                    number of very minute hooks, which fit into a thickened rim on the posterior
                    margin of the front wings, so that the two become united, and strike the air as
                    one whole. The wings are usually transparent, and, in certain arrangements of
                    the light, are seen to be highly iridescent. Occasionally they are coloured in
                    patches, or are entirely black or blue; in the latter case, they are not
                    unfrequently of a thickish texture and have a metallic lustre, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Hylotoma.</hi> The smaller forms
                    <hi rend="italic">(Chalciclidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxyurd)</hi> have few
                    or no nervures. Some of these have the wings deeply fringed; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mymar</hi><hi rend="italic">anàFlabrinus</hi> have the wings as it
                    were cleft and stalked; that is to say, there is a long, thin stalk projecting
                    from the thorax for a certain distance; then it dilates into a number of deeply
                    fringed branches (see fig. 5).</p>
                <p>The head is seldom broader than the thorax. It is usually of a more or less
                    globular shape, but may be much flattened and long. The compound eyes are placed
                    along the sides, while the simple eyes, or ocelli, are arranged in a triangle on
                    the vertex. Certain ants and <hi rend="italic">Chalcididoe</hi> are blind.
                    Others have eyes, but want the ocelli. The mouth organs are, except with bees,
                    adapted solely for mastication or for prehension; while, in addition to
                    performing these functions, wasps use them for building up or digging out their
                    nests in the ground or wood. Some worker ants and other aculeates (especially
                    males) have the mandibles enormously developed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dlastophaga,</hi> an insect found in figs, has a curious mandible, remarkable,
                    not in itself, but by having attached to it an appendage whose use is supposed
                    to be to clean away the juice of the fig from the mouth. The maxilla and labium
                    are provided with jointed palpi.</p>
                <p>The number of joints in the maxillary palpi is usually five, but may be more or
                    less than that; the labial palpi are two-to four-jointed. It is with bees that
                    the mouth parts (and especially the ligula) have their greatest development and
                    specialization. With them the various parts (except the mandibles) are elongated
                    to form a sucking tube, by means of which they lap up the nectar of flowers.</p>
                <p>The form of the antennae is very variable. They may have three <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hylotoma)</hi> to sixty joints (ichneumons); may be very long and thin as in
                    ichneumons, or scarcely projecting beyond the head as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perga</hi>; of uniform thickness, or distinctly clavate as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cimbeχ∙,</hi> bare, or very hairy. Then they often differ very much in the
                    males. <hi rend="italic">Lophyrus (Tenthre-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dinidoe)oxLd</hi> many <hi rend="italic">Chalcididoe</hi> have them pectinated
                    in various degrees; they are deeply forked in <hi rend="italic">Schizoceτa</hi>;
                    and many others have them covered with long hair, although they are quite bare
                    in the other sex. In some families the number of joints varies very much, but
                    most <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> have the same number, namely, 13 in the
                    male and 12 in the female. These appendages serve as sense organs, especially
                    for the discovery of food, and, in the male, for finding the female. At any rate
                    an ichneumon (for instance) when searching for a larva in which to lay its eggs
                    (and this has especially been noticed with those which oviposit in concealed
                    larvae) keeps them in a state of continuous trembling motion, and males have
                    also been observed to do the same when searching for the females.</p>
                <p>The three divisions of the thorax—pro-, meso-, and metathorax—have pretty much
                    the same relative proportions in all the families. The prothorax is small. The
                    upper part is strongly articulated to the mesothorax, while the lower is freer;
                    and it is by means of this lower part that the head is united to the thorax. The
                    metathorax is very large, as might be expected, from its having to take such an
                    important part in flight. As for the scutellum it varies more than any other
                    portion of the thorax. Mostly it is flat, or at least only slightly raised above
                    the mesonotum; but in the smaller groups <hi rend="italic">(Oxyura,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididoe, Cynipidoe)</hi> its form is sometimes very curious.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Aegilips (Cynipidoe)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agriotypes</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ichneumonidoe)</hi> it is produced into a
                    sharp more or less curved spine; in <hi rend="italic">Eucoela</hi> it is
                    cup-shaped, that is to say, it is raised up, and has the centre hollow. It
                    undergoes, however, its greatest development with some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chalcididoe.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Chirocerus,</hi> for example, it is
                    lengthened so much that it reaches the middle of the abdomen. The metathorax is
                    never very large, nor does it exhibit any marked peculiarities.</p>
                <p>The legs show the same manifold diversity in form that we found to exist with the
                    other appendages. The basal parts—thecoxae and trochanters—are not usually of
                    any size, except in the lower tribes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididoe.</hi> In classification the trochanters are of value,
                    for we find with the <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> they are joined to the
                    femora by a single joint, whereas in all the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenoptera</hi> there are two joints. Hence the bees, wasps, &amp;c., form the
                    division <hi rend="italic">Moηotrocha;</hi> and the ichneumons, saw-flies,
                    &amp;c., are denominated <hi rend="italic">Ditrocha.</hi> Some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chalcididoe</hi> have the femora greatly thickened, and toothed on the under
                    side j<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The enormous
                    development of the hind femora in <hi rend="italic">Chαlcis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Leucaspis</hi> does not appear to give these insects extra leaping
                    power. Other <hi rend="italic">Chalcididoe</hi> which have not thickened femora
                    can leap considerable distances.</p></note> but as a rule it does not show any
                    striking peculiarity unless it be with some male insects. As might be expected
                    from their more intimate connexion with the habits of the insects, the tibiae
                    and tarsi vary according to the uses they are put to, apart from locomotion.
                    With bees (at least with the non-parasitie species) they are employed to carry
                    the pollen necessary for the nourishment of the young; for this purpose they are
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n588/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0588-0573"/> provided with hairs, or the apex of the tibiae
                    and base of the tarsi are flattened out to form a plate on which the pollen is
                    stored for its easier and more economical conveyance to the hive. They are
                    richly spined in the sand-wasps, and are thus useful to the animals in digging
                    out the nests which they form in the earth. At the base of the tibiae are placed
                    two spurs (calcaria), which, however, may be absent. Finally the tarsi are
                    provided with plate-like processes termed patellae, which may be very largely
                    developed, especially with males; and the front pair may terminate in large
                    jointed raptorial claws, as is the case with <hi rend="italic">Chelogynus
                    {f)xyura).</hi></p>
                <p>The abdomen may be united to the metathorax in two ways: it may be joined to it
                    by its entire width, or by a narrow pedicle only. In the former case the thorax
                    and abdomen form as it were one whole, so that the body has the appearance of
                    being composed of only two parts; whereas in the other section the three
                    divisions, head, thorax, and abdomen, are clearly separated, or specialized. It
                    is only the <hi rend="italic">Siricidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tenthredinidae</hi> which have the abdomen united by the whole width. Thus the
                    order becomes divided into two well-marked divisions, one represented by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tenthredinidae</hi> (having the abdomen sessile) and the other by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aculeata,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ichneumonidoe</hi> (having
                    it appendiculated). The abdomen shows little variation in structure or form in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidae</hi>; but does so to a large extent with
                    the others. Usually more or less globular and rounded, and not of any great
                    length compared to the head and thorax, it is often very much compressed and
                    sabre-like, as in <hi rend="italic">Ophion,</hi> or very long and thread-like as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Pelecinus∙,</hi> then it may be joined to the thorax in
                    such a way as to be semi-sessile, or by a very long, thin, threadlike pedicle
                    <hi rend="italic">{Peloρosus,</hi> many <hi rend="italic">Chalcididae,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae).</hi> Between these two extremes there are all
                    gradations, the form of the abdomen depending on the habits of the insect, upon
                    its manner of self-defence or of oviposition. As regards the number of the
                    segments, it varies. It is 8 with the <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidae</hi> and
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Siricidae,</hi> but in other groups it is less.
                    Through one or other of the basal segments being greatly developed, and the
                    terminal ones correspondingly reduced in size, some groups appear to have only 3
                    or 4 <hi rend="italic">{Chrysididae).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi>
                    have always the same number, namely, 7 in the males and 6 in the females. Some
                    bees <hi rend="italic">{Coelioxys)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chrysididae</hi>
                    have the abdomen armed with spines or teeth at the apex.</p>
                <p>The male and female organs are situated at the end of the abdomen. They are
                    rarely conspicuous externally with the males; but in some females they are of
                    great length, and may indeed exceed considerably the length of the body. However
                    different in the various groups of <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> the organs
                    connected with the laying of the eggs may be, they are fundamentally constructed
                    on the same plan in all of them, no matter how different they may appear or how
                    various the ways in which they may be used. A typical ovipositor in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> may be described as being composed of three
                    bristle-like organs,—one placed above, and the others below. This upper bristle
                    is channelled throughout, and has (when in use) the others pressed to it in such
                    a way that the three together form a narrow tube, through which the egg passes.
                    The two lower bristles are toothed at the lower end. These three parts are
                    enclosed between a couple of two-jointed valves, situated at their base, which
                    serve them as supports. Thus the ovipositor consists of five different parts. It
                    exists under two forms. In the bees and wasps <hi rend="italic">{Aculeata)</hi>
                    it takes the form of a sting, or weapon of defence; and it is connected with a
                    gland secreting a poison (the principal constituent being formic acid) which the
                    insect injects by means of the sting into any thing that attacks it. Besides
                    this defensive (or offensive) use to which it is put, it is employed by the
                    sand-wasps to benumb the larvae and other insects or spiders with which they
                    store their nests for the use of their young, in such a way that they remain to
                    all intents and purposes lifeless, yet still keeping fresh, until such time as
                    the wasp-larvae escape from the eggs and are ready to feed on them. In the rest
                    of the order—with ichneumons, saw-flies, &lt;kc.— it is not used as an
                    instrument of defence (some ichneumons, indeed, will attempt to pierce the hand
                    with it when caught, but they are never able to do any harm); it is simply an
                    instrument for laying the eggs, and is not connected with a poison gland, or at
                    any rate with a gland secreting a poison similar to that of a wasp. A poison
                    gland exists, for instance, with saw-flies, but its purpose and also the manner
                    of its use are different from what they are in the case of the aculeates. Its
                    function is to act on the plant in which the eggs are laid,—either to raise
                    galls in which the larvae will find food and shelter, or to prevent the hole
                    made by the ovipositor for the reception of the egg from closing in on the egg,
                    and thereby crushing it; for we find that eggs laid, for example, on leaves are
                    not closely pressed by the substance of the leaf, but have a more or less open
                    space surrounding them.</p>
                <p>From the observations of Kraepelin on the development of the ovipositor, it seems
                    clear that the grooved central bristle and the two basal sheaths arise in the
                    larva from papillae situated on the under side of the ninth abdominal segment,
                    while the two lateral (or rather lower) bristles have their origin in similar
                    papillae on the eighth. It would appear also highly probable that the parts are
                    true appendages of the abdominal segments, rather than modified portions of the
                    body walls.</p>
                <p>The ovipositor is either hidden (as is mostly the case) or may be exserted to a
                    greater or less extent. Its length varies with the habits of the species; that
                    is to say, the longer it is, the deeper, in wood, or in any other substance,
                    does the larva, on which the ichneumon is a parasite, live. Species with long
                    ovipositors occur in all the parasitic families, except the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oxyura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chrysididae.</hi> With the last-mentioned
                    family it is tubular. It is strangely modified with the saw-flies. With them it
                    forms a veritable sawing apparatus (hence the name of these insects), being
                    broad, plate-like, and toothed in various ways and degrees according to the
                    habits of the insects; according as the eggs are laid in leaves or in bark it is
                    slender and thin or broad and thick. In the pupa state <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenoptera</hi> with long ovipositors have them curled up on, and closely
                    pressed to, the back. It is a curious circumstance that this embryonic condition
                    of the ovipositor is retained in the perfect state by a few forms, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Leucaspis.</hi></p>
                <p>As remarked at the beginning of this article, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenoptera</hi> go throtigh a regular metamorphosis—appearing in four distinct
                    forms. The egg is generally longer than it is broad, and rounded at both ends.
                    The skin is always thin, never sculptured, and rarely coloured; the only
                    instance of colour in any of their eggs known to the writer being in those of
                    certain saw-flies which are more or less greenish, and this colour may have been
                    imbibed from the leaf. Many parasitic species <hi rend="italic">(Ophion,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cynips, Myrnar)</hi> have pedunculated eggs,—eggs provided with a
                    long pedicle or stalk, by means of which they are attached to the plant or
                    insect, as the case may be. A <hi rend="italic">Τryphon,</hi> for example,
                    attaches her stalked eggs to the larva’s skin; it hangs by the stalk; and when
                    the young tryphon-larva’s development in the egg is matured it leaves it by the
                    lower end, and then proceeds to bore its way into the inside of its victim. A
                    curious phenomenon has been observed to take place in hymenopterous eggs shortly
                    after being laid; it is that they swell up (perhaps by imbibing moisture,
                    although this cannot be the sole cause of the swelling) to double or more than
                    double the size they were when laid. Trie number of eggs laid by a female varies
                    of course with the species. Colonial species lay the greatest number; but with
                    them the eggs are not laid all at once, as is the case with solitary species.
                    Some social forms lay comparatively few eggs, while, on the other hand, many
                    saw-flies and ichneumons must lay some hundreds. Solitary bees and wasps do not
                    lay many; but it must be remembered that the storing of food and the building
                    and digging of the nest are workf of labour and time.</p>

                <p>The larvae are of two sorts. Those of species with a petiolated. abdomen are
                    white, footless grubs, incapable of any extended motion; nor is this necessary,
                    for they have not to seek their food, Which is provided for them by their
                    mothers,—either collected and stored up for them in nests made by the female, as
                    with bees and wasps, or by the eggs being placed in the bodies of other insects
                    on which they live as parasites, or in galls upheaved on plants. It is, however,
                    of interest to note that, While the larva after leaving the <hi rend="italic"
                    >egg</hi> shows no trace of legs, yet they were present when it was in the egg.
                    This shows clearly that the legs were lost through disuse. And this view is
                    confirmed by the fact that the larvae of the lowest division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi> those with a sessile abdomen, have jointed
                    thoracic legs, and often abdominal legs as well, while they, for the most part,
                    lead a free existence. In the lowest group of this division, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siriddae,</hi> as well as in those <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tenthredinidae</hi> most nearly allied to them, the larvae have only the
                    thoracic or true legs. They live either boring in wood, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sirex,</hi> or in stems of plants, as <hi rend="italic">Ceρhus,</hi> or in
                    leaves rolled together by silken threads, as <hi rend="italic">Lyda.</hi> Except
                    <hi rend="italic">Lyda, Cephus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Xyela,</hi> all the
                    saw-fly larvae have the usual thoracic and a variable number of false or
                    abdominal legs, which are in fact merely prolongations of the ventral surface of
                    the body, as with many phytophagous <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi>; nor have
                    they anything like the claspers of lepidopterous caterpillars. With their
                    similar habits and the presence of these ventral legs, saw-fly larvae have a
                    considerable resemblance to the caterpillars of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi> but they may be known from them in two ways,—by always having
                    more than five pairs of ventral legs (eight in <hi rend="italic">Cimbex,</hi>
                    seven in <hi rend="italic">Nematus,</hi> and six in some <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylotomides),</hi> and never having more than two ocelli—one on each side of
                    the head—instead of six on each side as in <hi rend="italic">Leρidoptera.</hi>
                    As with lepidopterous caterpillars, green is the prevailing colour of saw-fly
                    larvae. They agree with them, too, in their general habits: they live on the
                    leaves of various plants, devouring them in different ways, roll down leaves,
                    raise galls, and mine leaves. It is interesting to note further that, as with
                    lepidopterous caterpillars, larvae which are innoxious and eaten by birds are
                    either entirely green, or green with black, pink, or white stripes along the
                    sides and back, while noxious larvae—those with bad smells or secretions which
                    render them unpalatable to birds—have bright contrasting colours with irregular
                    markings, tubercles, &amp;c., and they feed exposed, so that they may be readily
                    seen and avoided. Some hymenopterous larvae before becoming pupae moult a
                    certain number of times. According to Packard, a <hi rend="italic">Bombus</hi>
                    casts off its skin ten times; <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidae</hi> do it five
                    times; but many (all parasitic, and most aculeates) do not moult until they
                    become pupae; nor do they empty the* contents of the stomach till then. The
                    period during which a hymenopteron remains in the larva state is seldom long; it
                    may be eight or nine days, or a month or two, but this depends on the season of
                    the year; for many larvae, which have not been able to reach maturity in the
                    autumn, remain in the same condition until the following spring, when they
                    pupate. In order that this period may be passed in quietness, a cocoon is
                    usually spun by the larva. For this purpose it is provided with a spinning
                    apparatus, and a gland for secreting the silk required for the construction of
                    the cocoon. With the <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> it is thin and almost
                    transparent; it is of a firmer consistency with ichneumons, and is often
                    coloured black, brown, or grey. <hi rend="italic">Microgaster</hi> and other <hi
                    rend="italic">Bra-</hi><hi rend="italic">conidoe</hi> spin their cocoons in
                    company, and often around the dead body of the larva which they have devoured.
                    They may be placed together without any regularity, or closely pressed in
                    regularly arranged rows like the cells in a hive. Some ichneumons suspend their
                    cocoons from twigs, &amp;c., by means of a silken thread. Generally the cocoon
                    is single, but certain saw-flies <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Cimbex)</hi> spin
                    double ones,—a thin inner one (which may be separated from the outer one by a
                    considerable space) placed inside an outer, harder, and more tenacious covering.
                    A cocoon, however, is not always spun. <hi rend="italic">Cynipidoe</hi> never
                    spin one, nor apparently do <hi rend="italic">Ghalcididae</hi> nor some ants,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g., Myrmica.</hi> The empty skin of the caterpillar which
                    they have devoured is utilized by some ichneumons instead of a cocoon; galls
                    serve the same purpose with others; while <hi rend="italic">Ernphytus</hi> and
                    other <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidae</hi> bore into pithy stems, where they
                    pass into pupae without any other protection. Finally, others make a cell in the
                    earth for the same purpose.</p>
                <p>The pupa resembles very closely the perfect insect, save that the wings are not
                    developed, although visible as pad-like structures along the sides. The legs and
                    antennae are laid along the front of the body, enclosed in thin pellicles. In
                    certain <hi rend="italic">Ghalcididae</hi><hi rend="italic">(Eulo-ρhus)</hi> the
                    pupa is of that form called “coarceate”; that is to say, the entire body is
                    enveloped in a case which conceals its form, and this case is hard and of some
                    thickness, instead of being a mere thin transparent skin. When the insect leaves
                    this pupal covering the latter retains its form intact. Most pupae are white.
                    Manysaw-fly pupae are green, with orange spots on the abdomen. A few <hi
                    rend="italic">Braconidoe</hi><hi rend="italic">(Apanteles)</hi> have
                    orange-coloured pupae.</p>
                <p>In the pupa state <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> remain but a short time,—as
                    a rule, not more than seven to ten days. They are not entirely quiescent in this
                    condition, but have considerable power of motion, especially if exposed to the
                    light, or disturbed in any way. As the insect gradually reaches maturity, the
                    pupa becomes more or less black,—at first on the back of the thorax, then on the
                    abdomen and limbs. When maturity is gained, the insect splits the pellicles
                    which so closely envelop its body; the limbs are freed; the wings spread out and
                    lose their flabby consistency; the nervures become hard and firm; the insect
                    moves about, ejects from the anus a coloured liquid, and enters on its new mode
                    of existence.</p>
                <p>Hymenopterous insects procreate by the union of the two sexes. This takes place
                    usually in the sunshine. Sometimes the connexion does not last more than a few
                    seconds, and is not preceded by any preliminary courting. On the other hand many
                    bees remain united for hours, and the genital parts of the male get torn and
                    ruptured, so that it dies immediately after. Some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ghalcididae</hi> have been observed coquetting together for more than an hour
                    before uniting. Generally copulation takes place on the ground; but a few forms
                    pair on the wing. The male <hi rend="italic">Anthophora,</hi> for instance,
                    carries the female with him into the air for the marriage flight. This is the
                    reason why the male <hi rend="italic">Anthophora</hi> is larger than the female,
                    instead of being smaller, as is usually the case.</p>
                <p>While, as has been said, <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> reproduce by the
                    union of the two sexes, yet parthenogenesis or virgin reproduction is of not
                    uncommon occurrence, and has been observed in all the families whose development
                    for more than one generation can be traced with sufficient facility and
                    accuracy. We meet with this phenomenon under (broadly speaking) two or three
                    phases. Many females, if they cannot get access to males, will readily lay eggs,
                    which are fertile and give issue to larvae; but these larvae, when they reach
                    maturity, yield invariably males. Any one can test this for himself with the too
                    common gooseberry grub, <hi rend="italic">Nematus ribesii.</hi> The same thing
                    occurs with wasps, ants, and bees. With saw-flies, again, there are some species
                    whose males are quite unknown, although the species have been caught and bred
                    from the larvae in hundreds, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Hriocampa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ovata.</hi> Others have males, but they are extremely rare, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., Nematus gaUicola.</hi> It has been shown, too, that the
                    species just mentioned and some others <hi rend="italic">(Phyl-lotoma
                    ηemorata,</hi><hi rend="italic">Poecilosoma</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pulveratum,</hi> &lt;fcc.) with males unknown readily lay fertile eggs. The
                    queen bee can lay eggs which will produce males or females, by opening or
                    closing the spermatic sac, and letting the eggs come in contact or not with the
                    spermatic fluid. In the former case females will be the result, in the latter
                    males. Worker bees, wasps, and ants deposit eggs which produce, however, only
                    males. A still more curious phenomenon in connexion with the reproduction of
                    some gall-insects <hi rend="italic">(Cynipidoe)</hi> requires to be mentioned.
                    In early spring will be found on oak leaves and flowers soft, juicy, greenish,
                    globular pea-shaped galls. Out of these come in summer the gallflies represented
                    by both sexes. In the autumn (also on oak leaves) are found those curious flat
                    brownish galls commonly called “oak spangles,” which by many are taken for
                    fungi, and have indeed been described as such. These “spangle galls” retain very
                    much the same form during the autumn and winter; then in March they swell up and
                    become juicy, and a larva makes its appearance; this soon becomes a pupa and
                    finally a fly, but only in one sex, the female. It was long supposed that these
                    two insects had no relationship with each other, that they belonged in fact to
                    two distinct genera, for not only did the galls differ, but the insects
                    themselves differed in the form of the body, the wings, àc. But it has recently
                    been shown by Dr Adler that the two are forms of the same species, that there is
                    an alternation of a spring bisexual form, with an autumnal unisexual one.</p>
                <p>A dimorphism of another kind exists among the social bees, wasps, and ants. An
                    ordinary colony of these insects consists of three sorts of individuals. There
                    is the large female which founded the colony; then there <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n590/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0590-0575"/> are the workers or neuters, undeveloped females
                    on whom the work of the colony depends; and, lastly, there are the males. It is
                    with ants that the workers are most profoundly modified. They are wingless, and
                    there may be in a colony several sorts, each kind performing different duties,
                    and having the body modified in accordance with the work it has to do. Those
                    which act as soldiers (when a special kind is set apart for this work), for
                    instance, have the mandibles enormously developed; another set may secrete honey
                    for the benefit of the others, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> must be regarded as one of the most
                    beneficial and useful to man of the insect orders. The produce of the hive
                    bee—wax and honey—has been employed by man since the earliest ages, and forms an
                    extensive article of commerce. The curious structures raised by <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynipidoe</hi> on the oaks of eastern Europe—galls—have long been
                    used in the manufacture of ink. But, whatever the bee may have done in
                    contributing to our luxuries, and the gall-fly in rendering easier the advance
                    of knowledge, these are small benefits compared to the indirect advantages we
                    derive from the labours of the parasitic species through the hιvoc they make
                    among the insects which devour the produce of our fields and gardens, and too
                    often destroy the labours of the farmer and gardener. When we remember that
                    there are vast numbers of insects which destroy plants; that many of these are
                    so minute and obscure in their mode of life as to escape ordinary observation,
                    save when the injury is done; and that others appear in enormous numbers, —it
                    becomes evident that an insect which causes the death of a single caterpillar
                    does good service, since that caterpillar would have (if left undisturbed)
                    given, in all probability, origin to an imago which might give birth to hundreds
                    of others. It is this which the ichneumons do,— they destroy the larvae of
                    plant-devouring insects. Another division of <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi>
                    does equally good service. It has been shown by modern researches that without
                    the aid of bees many flowers would never yield seed. Many plants cannot
                    fertilize themselves, so that if bees did not carry the pollen from one plant to
                    another, and thus effect fertilization, no seed would be produced. The red
                    clover, for instance, would never produce seed if it were not for the humble
                    bees fertilizing it in their visits in search of honey. It must, however, be
                    confessed that some <hi rend="italic">Hymenσptera</hi> do very considerable
                    damage to vegetation, especially saw-flies and ants. Of injurious saw-flies the
                    most destructive are <hi rend="italic">Eriocampa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >adumbrata,</hi> on fruit trees <hi rend="italic">; JVematus ribesii,</hi> which
                    is so destructive to the gooseberry and red currant; <hi rend="italic">Athalia
                    spinarum,</hi> at one time so destructive to the turnip (probably when it first
                    took to feeding on it); and <hi rend="italic">Cephus,</hi> in the stems of corn.
                    The damage done by ants in Europe is small; but in the tropics the leaf-cutting
                    ants do enormous damage by cutting down the leaves of trees (especially
                    cultivated ones), which they convey into their nests, where they are used
                    (according to Belt) to rear fungi upon which the ants feed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> are almost exclusively dwellers on land,
                    and are essentially sun-loving insects. Two or three only live an aquatic or
                    quasi-aquatic mode of life. Sir John Lubbock discovered two minute species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Oxyura (JPoly-ηema)</hi> which descend into the water for the
                    purpose of depositing their eggs in the eggs of aquatic insects. They use the
                    wings as oars to swim in the water, and can remain in it for two hours. An
                    ichneumon <hi rend="italic">(Agriotypes)</hi> has long been known to live as a
                    parasite in the bodies of caddisworms; and it has been observed to go down into
                    the water to find the worms, which are said, when infested by the ichneumons, to
                    anchor themselves by means of a silken thread.</p>
                <p>Many <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> give origin to sounds. The humming of
                    bees is one of the most familiar and delightful of country sounds. It is not yet
                    quite clearly understood how it is caused, but there is evidence enough to show
                    that the buzzing originates by the air impinging against the lips of the
                    metathoracic and abdominal stigmas; although it is possible, too, that the rapid
                    vibration of the wings (224 per second with the <hi rend="italic">Bombus
                    muscorum</hi> and 440 with the honey bee) may also have something to do with the
                    production of sound, for a bee can give out differently pitched notes according
                    to its mood, as it is pleased or angry. Besides the buzzing sounds, a few other
                    species chirp by means of the abdominal segments. <hi rend="italic">Mutilla</hi>
                    stridulates by drawing in and out the raised striated surface of the third under
                    the edge of the elongated second segment. The workers of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrmica</hi> stridulate in pretty much the same way.</p>
                <p>The internal anatomy of the <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> presents some
                    interesting features. Their organs of secretion are numerous. The poison is
                    secreted in two long ramose tubes; and from them it goes into a sac situated
                    near the base of the sting. Wax is made in some of the abdominal segments.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The wax is secreted on the
                    ventral surface of the hive bee, but on the dorsal surface with the stingless
                    bee of America <hi rend="italic">(JUelipοnα).</hi></p></note> The salivary
                    glands in the hive bee (worker) are very large and complicated. They are three
                    in number, two (an upper and a lower) placed in the head, and the other in the
                    front region of the thorax. Each gland is different, and has excretory ducts of
                    its own. In the queen bee these are not nearly so much developed as in the
                    worker, and they are even less in the drones. Many saw-fly larvae secrete fluids
                    for purposes of defence. Some species of <hi rend="italic">Tenthredo</hi>
                    secrete a blackish liquid, which they eject from the mouth; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perga</hi> throws out a gummy matter from the same orifice, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cimbex</hi> an acid liquid from lateral pores. Then there are the
                    silk-secreting glands which most larvae possess. The urinary vessels are always
                    present, and may be as many as 150. According to Von Siebold, the aculeates have
                    a long intestine and a stomach with many convolutions, while they are short in
                    the terebrant forms. The tracheae are well developed. Many dilatations are given
                    off from the main stems, a pair at the base of the abdomen being exceptionally
                    large. In connexion with the female organs of generation, it is worthy of remark
                    that sebaceous glands and a copulatory pouch are absent in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aculeata,</hi> although present in the other section. The ovaries are two in
                    number, and consist of a number (it may be as many as a hundred) of distinct
                    many-chambered tubes. Each tube in <hi rend="italic">Athalia,</hi> for instance,
                    contains 7 eggs, and, as there are 18 of such tubes in each ovary, there will be
                    thus 250 eggs in all. In <hi rend="italic">Platygaster</hi> the ovary is of a
                    very exceptional nature, inasmuch as the egg tube is a close sac, so that it is
                    burst when the egg is laid.</p>
                <p>The most noteworthy and exceptional features in the developmental history of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> are those shown by some very minute species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Oxyura,</hi> which live in the bodies of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diρtera (Cecidomyia),</hi> and in the eggs of beetles and dragon-flies. After
                    the eggs of <hi rend="italic">Platygaster</hi> have undergone segmentation, and
                    the embryo has been formed, there leaves the egg a larva of a very unusual form.
                    It is broad and rounded at the head, but contracted towards the tail, which
                    terminates in four spined, bristle-like appendages, so that the larva has a
                    considerable resemblance to a copepod. It is provided with a mouth and hook-like
                    mandibles, by the aid of which it anchors itself inside the body of its host
                    (the larva of a <hi rend="italic">Cecidomyia);</hi> there are a rudimentary
                    stomach and antennae, but no trace of nerves, tracheae, or organs of
                    circulation. Soon it changes its form: the tail with its bristles is thrown off;
                    it becomes shaped somewhat like a hen’s egg; the nervous, circulatory, and
                    reproductive organs become visible, while the alimentary organs show an advance
                    in structure. This second <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n591/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0591-0576"/> larva is succeeded by a third, which differs from
                    it in being longer and thinner, while the various organs have reached a further
                    stage of advancement in complexity of structure. The after course of its
                    development does not differ from that of other <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera.
                    Polynema</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hymar</hi> (eggparasites) go through
                    somewhat similar changes in their early embryonic life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification.—</hi> As regards the classification of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi> the order divides itself naturally into two
                    great divisions, as has been already indicated. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aculeata</hi> form a division distinguished alike by the form of the sting,
                    with its connected poison-bag, and by the trochanter being joined to the femur
                    by a single joint. The other division (that usually called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terebrantia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ditrocha)</hi> has a double joint to the
                    trochanter, and the ovipositor is never used as a weapon of offence.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ditrocha</hi> are again divided into two sections, well
                    distinguished by the form of the abdomen, by the larva, and by habits: the one
                    (the <hi rend="italic">Securifera)</hi> has the abdomen sessile, the larvae have
                    legs, and they are phytophagous; while the other (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sρiculifera)</hi> has the abdomen petiolated, the larvae are apodal, and they
                    are (except part of the <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae)</hi> animal feeders. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Securifera</hi> are further distinguished from all others by
                    the form of the ovipositor, which forms either a short “saw,” as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tenthredinidoe,</hi> or a stout exserted “borer,” as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siricidae</hi>; and they have another peculiarity in having at the
                    bottom of the anterior wing a cellule, termed the “lanceolate cellule” (see fig.
                    1, above), which is found in no other family, and is of great use in
                    classification. The <hi rend="italic">Securifera</hi> embraces the families <hi
                    rend="italic">Tenthredinidoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Siricidae</hi> (by some
                    <hi rend="italic">Cephus</hi> is made into a third family, while by others it is
                    placed among the <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidoe,</hi> owing to its agreeing
                    with the saw-flies in the form of the thorax and ovipositor, and by others with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Siricidae,</hi> because it has only one spine in the
                    anterior leg, while the saw-flies have two). The species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siricidae</hi> are few in number, and have a very wide distribution. They are
                    larger than any <hi rend="italic">Tenthredinidoe,</hi> and are indeed among the
                    giants of the order. All live in wood, especially in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coniferoe,</hi> and have occasionally done great damage to the forests in
                    Germany. As they are easily imported along with timber, they very often make
                    their appearance in out-of-the-way places and frighten ignorant people,
                    although, of course, they are perfectly harmless.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spiculifera</hi> contain the families <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynipidae, Chalcididoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Broc-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >totrypidae, Evanidoe, Braconidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichneumonidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae,</hi> or gall-flies, are small insects, rarely
                    exceeding two lines in length. The antennae are straight, inserted in the middle
                    of the face; the joints are variously shaped, and do not exceed 16 in number.
                    The thorax is large; the scutellum always forms a conspicuous object, and its
                    form is very varied. The abdomen is much compressed, especially with the males;
                    curled up over the apical segments is the long thin bristle-like ovipositor. A
                    few species are apterous. There is always a radial cellule in the anterior wing,
                    but few nervures and there is never a stigma. What distinguishes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynipidae</hi> more especially is their habit of raising galls on
                    plants to serve as food and lodgings for their young.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is a radical distinction between the
                    gall-making <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae</hi> and the gallmaking saw-flies. The
                    latter feed on the gall itself, so that in course of time it becomes reduced to
                    a mere bladder; and the gall is fully formed before the larva leaves the egg. On
                    the other hand, the development of <hi rend="italic">(!ynips</hi> and the growth
                    of the gall go on at the same time,—the reason of this being that it feeds only
                    on the juice of the gall, which hardens and dries very soon after it mokes its
                    appearance, so that necessarily the larva has to feed up rapidly. After the gall
                    has dried the larva occupies a cell of harder matter than the rest of the gall,
                    not much larger than its own bulk.</p></note> These galls have the most
                    diversified shapes, and are raised on all parts of a plant—the buds, leaves,
                    roots, flowers, and fruit all being used by the gall insects. A gall may serve
                    to shelter a solitary larva, or it may be so large as to contain many hundreds.
                    The oak is the principal tree used by the <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae</hi>; next
                    is the rose, upon which is found the well-known “bedeguar gall” of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhodites</hi><hi rend="italic">rosae,</hi> once used medicinally;
                    the maple, poppy, bramble, hawkweed, and some other plants have likewise their
                    galls. All <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae,</hi> however, are not gall-makers. One
                    group deposit their eggs in the galls raised by the true gall-makers, when they
                    are soft and young, and the larva of the cuckoo-fly lives on the gall at the
                    expense of the legitimate owner, which is killed by the more energetic intruder.
                    Another group contains pure animal feeders, parasites which live at the expense
                    of other insects (especially plant lice).</p>
                <p>Closely allied to the <hi rend="italic">Cynipidae</hi> is the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididoe,</hi> an immense tribe of very minute insects with
                    brilliant metallic green bodies. Their wings have few nervures, and they never
                    form closed cellules, but a stigma is always present. The antennae are always
                    elbowed; they have never more than 13 joints, and may have as few as 6. With the
                    males they are sometimes flabellate, or covered with tufts of hair. Generally
                    the ovipositor is short and concealed, but it may be exserted and much longer
                    than the entire body. In either case it issues from the lower side of the belly.
                    Apterous and semi-apterous species are not uncommon. In habits the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalcididoe</hi> are very diversified. They are parasites on
                    insects of all orders and in all stages. While no definite line can be drawn,
                    yet particular groups in the mass confine their attacks to certain families of
                    insects. Thus <hi rend="italic">Leucaspis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chalcis</hi> are attached to bees and other nestbuilding aculeates, the
                    long-tailed <hi rend="italic">Torymides</hi> to oak and other galls, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encrytides</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Homoptera (Coccus</hi>
                    especially). Species of <hi rend="italic">Isosoma</hi> appear to be herbivorous,
                    and one in America is destructive to corn, by raising gall-like structures at
                    the joints and thus causing the plant to wither. Giraud has likewise described
                    <hi rend="italic">Isosoma</hi> to be a vegetable feeder, at any rate during a
                    considerable portion of its life, as well as another species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aulogymnus</hi><hi rend="italic">aceris)</hi> which lives in galls on the
                    maple. Those curious forms, <hi rend="italic">Sycophaga</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Blastophaga,</hi> which live in figs, appear undoubtedly to feed
                    on their seeds.</p>
                <p>The species of <hi rend="italic">Proctotrypidae</hi> (called also <hi
                    rend="italic">Oxyura),</hi> unlike those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chalcididoe,</hi> are dull-coloured insects, usually entirely black, or at best
                    relieved by brown or red. They are distinguished from the last family by the
                    non-elbowed antennae, which are 8- to 13- jointed. The wings in the smaller
                    forms may be without nervures, while in the higher they are much more developed
                    than in the <hi rend="italic">Chalcididae.</hi> The edges of the wings are
                    deeply fringed with some species; and other species have dense patches of hair
                    on the thorax and abdomen. One group bears raptorial claws on the front tarsi;
                    and, in connexion with this structure, it is worthy of notice that the late A.
                    H. Haliday observed one species to kill and deposit in an empty straw a
                    caterpillar, apparently for the purpose of laying its eggs in it; so that in
                    habits it approximates to the fossorial <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi>
                    which some of them undoubtedly do in structure. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oxyura</hi> are parasites. Some are attached to gall insects, others to
                    aphides, while <hi rend="italic">Diptera</hi> and eggs of insects of all orders
                    afford nourishment to many.</p>
                <p>The insects usually called “ichneumons” belong to two families — the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichneumonidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Braconidae.</hi> Both are
                    readily distinguished from the families already mentioned by the wings being
                    well provided with nervures, which form regular cellules, by the greater number
                    of joints in the antennae, and generally by their much greater size. The only
                    radical distinctions between the groups are that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichneumonidae</hi> have two recurrent nervures, and a little joint in front of
                    the second antennal joint, whereas this is absent in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Braconidae,</hi> which have besides only one recurrent nervure. In habits there
                    is no broad distinction between them. They are parasites on insects of all
                    orders. The <hi rend="italic">Evanidoe</hi> are a small and somewhat
                    heterogeneous assemblage of insects, which do not agree very well in their
                    structure; but the typical species may be known by the abdomen being inserted in
                    the middle or above the middle of the metathorax. As far as is known the family
                    are parasitic on cockroaches, and appear to be not very numerous in species.</p>
                <p>In some respects the <hi rend="italic">Ghrysididae</hi> are intermediate between
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Terebrantia,</hi>
                    for they have the single-jointed trochanter of the former, while in the
                    structure of the ovipositor, in having the antennae 13-jointed in both sexes, as
                    well as in habit, they agree with the latter. They are exceedingly brilliant
                    insects; their bodies are metallic, with shining green, purple, or golden hues.
                    The abdomen hangs as it were from the thorax, and is somewhat concave on the
                    under side. It can be bent under the thorax, so that the insect can roll itself
                    up into a ball, which is its way of protecting itself when attacked—its hard
                    metallic coat of mail being impregnable against the mandibles of other insects.
                    These insects differ from other terebrant <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> in
                    the structure of the abdomen, for it has never more than four segments visible
                    in the female and five in the male, while the ichneumons have always more. The
                    terminal segments form a tube, which is used in oviposition. In habits the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ghrysididae</hi> do not differ from the ichneumons, being
                    parasites. They prey principally on bees and wasps, whose nests they enter when
                    the owners are absent, and should they be discovered their hard skin saves them
                    from serious injury. Indeed the only portions of their bodies which can be
                    mutilated are the wings. St Fargeau observed a bee do this to a chrysis; she bit
                    off the four wings, but did not thereby save her young, for as soon as the bee
                    left, the now wingless parasite crawled into the nest and laid her eggs
                    therein.</p>
                <p>As has been stated, the <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> are distinguished from
                    all other <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> by having a sting, a single-jointed
                    trochanter, and the antennae with 12 joints in the female and 13 in the male.
                    They differ, too, in habits from the <hi rend="italic">Terebrantia,</hi> for,
                    although many of them are parasites, their parasitism is unlike that of the
                    ichneumons. Parasitic <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> earn their bread
                    differently: they enter the nests of other aculeate species and lay their eggs
                    in the food stored up there for the benefit of the young of the builder, which
                    are starved or destroyed by the more vigorous larva of the parasite. In order to
                    carry out their ends with greater ease, some parasites mimic the forms of the
                    species upon which they prey. Thus <hi rend="italic">Apathus rupestris</hi> is
                    coloured exactly like <hi rend="italic">Bombus lapidarius,</hi> its host. On the
                    other hand the species of <hi rend="italic">Nrnnada,</hi> an extensive genus of
                    parasitic bees, do not resemble in the least the bees on which they prey; they
                    have instead gaudily coloured, hairless bodies. One of the most interesting
                    chapters in the history of the <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> is their nest
                    building. The nests are built in all sorts of places and of all kinds of
                    materials.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n592/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0592-0577"/>
                <p>Many, like <hi rend="italic">Andrena,</hi> dig in light soils a burrow,
                    consisting of a narrow passage going down some inches, and having at each side
                    of it at intervals cells in which the food is stored. Wood is used by others to
                    form somewhat similar cells, which may be lined with pieces of leaves or
                    flowers. The stems of brambles are utilized by a large number of species of bees
                    and fossorial <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera. Osmia</hi> uses empty shells for
                    its habitation. Then others build up nests. <hi rend="italic">Chalicodoma</hi>
                    and other bees, with many wasps, construct cells by cementing together bits of
                    mud and clay. Social wasps form their large nests of paper made of masticated
                    wood; humble bees and the hive bee do so by a secretion called wax. Some ants
                    build up from the ground, of leaves, &amp;c., nests shaped like a hay-stack,
                    which in size they may almost equal. An Indian species builds, at the ends of
                    branches of trees, large nests of dead and living leaves matted together with a
                    white web. Finally, the thorns of <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> are hollowed out
                    by others to serve as a residence.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Aculeata</hi> may be divided into five families—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Formiddae,</hi> or ants, <hi rend="italic">Mutillidae</hi>
                    (commonly called “solitary ants”), <hi rend="italic">Fossores</hi> (sand-ιvasps,
                    &amp;c.), <hi rend="italic">Diploptera,</hi> or true wasps, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthophila,</hi> or bees. The ants are, as a rule, social insects,
                    and their workers differ from those of wasps and bees in being always
                    wingless.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The wings,
                    however, may be distinguished in the pupae of the neuters, thus showing clearly
                    that they have been lost through disuse.</p></note> What morphologically more
                    especially distinguishes ants from other aculeates is the structure of the
                    abdomen, which at the base (on the peduncle or petiole) is provided either with
                    a flattened plate-like projection or with two nodes. · In the former case, there
                    is, as in <hi rend="italic">Formica,</hi> only a rudimentary sting, while in the
                    latter there is an efficient one, as in <hi rend="italic">Myrmica</hi>; but
                    there are exceptions to both rules. A few ants are solitary and. parasitic in
                    habits, and in this case the female is wingless. Closely allied to the ants are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mutillidae</hi> (by some authors the two are placed in one
                    group, <hi rend="italic">Heterogena),</hi> which, however, differ from them in
                    being solitary, in having neither a scale nor node, while the tibiae are spined,
                    and the tarsi ciliated. It is only the males which are winged, and they have the
                    abdomen spined and curved at the apex. They are brightly coloured insects, and
                    are very numerous in species. So far as is known they are parasites on humble
                    bees. The group of <hi rend="italic">Fossores</hi> is a very extensive one.
                    Their habits are very interesting and varied even in the same genus. They are
                    carnivorous, storing up (after having benumbed but not killed) caterpillars,
                    beetles, flies, aphides, &amp;c., in cells formed or dug out of wood or of
                    bramble stems, in the ground, or built up of mud or sand. Some build no nests,
                    and store up no food for their young, but live, cuckoo fashion, on other <hi
                    rend="italic">Fossores</hi> or bees. In general structure the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diploptera</hi> do not differ essentially from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fossores</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but they may be readily known from them
                    by the wings being folded longitudinally in repose, while the eyes are reniform
                    and reach to or near to the base of the mandibles. They differ too from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fossores</hi> in some of them being social, as is the case with
                    <hi rend="italic">Polistes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vespa.</hi> In habits the
                    solitary wasps agree more or less with the <hi rend="italic">Fossores.</hi>
                    While the above-mentioned tribes are carnivorous, the bees, on the other
                    hand,∙are entirely vegetable feeders, living on the pollen or nectar of flowers.
                    As might be expected, we find with them certain peculiarities of structure in
                    connexion with their habits. The great business of a bee is the storing up of
                    food, for its own use or (and more especially) for that of its young. To do this
                    to the best advantage certain parts of the body are adapted for the carrying
                    home of pollen. This is done more especially on the legs. The basal joint of the
                    tarsus is, for this purpose, flattened and compressed, and covered (at least on
                    the inner side) with hair. This then, is a character which distinguishes them
                    from all other aculeates. The least specialized bees carry home the pollen
                    loose, but <hi rend="italic">Apis</hi> mixes it into a paste in the field. To
                    serve the same end the mouth parts are profoundly modified for the lapping of
                    nectar, hlany bees are parasites on other bees. These want the pollen collecting
                    apparatus, and many of them have bright-coloured hairless bodies, as already
                    remarked.</p>
                <p>The earliest <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> known belong to the upper Oolitic
                    formation; but, as they are <hi rend="italic">Apidae,</hi> it is certain that
                    the order must have appeared much earlier in time than that. At the present day,
                    representatives of the order are found in all parts of the world, even as far
                    north as 78° to 83° N. lat., where <hi rend="italic">Bombi</hi> and ichneumons
                    were found by the naturalists attached to the Arctic expedition of 1875-76. Many
                    genera in all the families have a very wide distribution, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ophion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pimpla</hi> among
                    the ichneumons, <hi rend="italic">Ody-nenιs</hi> with the wasps, <hi
                    rend="italic">Megachile</hi> with bees. Humble bees and saw-flies are
                    characteristic of temperate, if not northern, latitudes; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mutilla</hi> of warm regions, although it also appears in arctic regions. <hi
                    rend="italic">Vespa is rΑθxe</hi> limited in its range than the solitary wasps
                    <hi rend="italic">(Odynerus,</hi> &amp;c.), being absent from Africa, Australia,
                    and South America. Many individual species have a very extensive range. This has
                    been brought about in some cases by the aid of man. In this way many pests have
                    been carried over the globe, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Nematus ribesii,</hi> the
                    gooseberry grub, which is now spreading over the American gardens; <hi
                    rend="italic">Eriocampa</hi><hi rend="italic">adumbrata,</hi> the slug worm of
                    British fπιit trees, has reached New Zealand; while, among ants, the house ant
                    of Madeira <hi rend="italic">(Pheidole</hi><hi rend="italic">pusilla)</hi> is
                    now cosmopolitan. Many species are common to the Palaearctic and Nearctic
                    regions, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Megachile centuncularis, Vespa vulgaris,
                    Hemichroa rufa.</hi> Others have a wider geographical range. The ant <hi
                    rend="italic">Solenopsis</hi><hi rend="italic">geminata,</hi> for instance, is
                    found in India, the Eastern Archipelago, South America, and the Hawaiian
                    Islands. <hi rend="italic">Hylotoma</hi><hi rend="italic">pagana,</hi> again,
                    occurs in the Southern States of America, and all over Europe, ana extends to
                    India and Japan.</p>
                <p>There being no complete list of <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi> it is not
                    easy to give the number of described species, but probably it is not much over
                    17,000. The actual number, however, must be very much greater; probably it will
                    be found to reach 70,000 or 80,000; for in those countries where anything like
                    the same attention has been paid to them as to beetles they are nearly as
                    numerous; and in no country have they received so much attention as <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera.</hi> As regards the number of British species, there
                    are recorded in the catalogues published by the Entomological Society of London,
                    in 1871-2, 378 <hi rend="italic">Aculeata,</hi> 1654 <hi rend="italic"

                    about 2700. Besides these there are about 150 <hi rend="italic">Cynipidoe,</hi>
                    and upwards of 1200 <hi rend="italic">Chalcididae</hi> have been described by
