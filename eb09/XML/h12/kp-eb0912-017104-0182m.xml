                    (1778-1817), political economist, was born at Edinburgh, August 12th, 1778.
                    After passing through the usual courses at the high school and university of his
                    native city, he devoted five years, the first two in England, to comprehensive
                    but desultory study, and in 1800 was called to the Scotch bar. Desirous,
                    however, of a wider sphere, Horner removed to London in 1802, and occupied the
                    interval that elapsed before his admission to the English bar in 1807 with
                    researches in law, philosophy, and political economy, and latterly with
                    parliamentary duties. In February 1806 he became one of the commissioners for
                    adjusting the claims against the nawab of Arcot, and in November entered
                    parliament as member for St Ives. Next year he sat for Wendover, and in 1812 for
                    St Mawes, in the patronage of the marquis of Buckingham. In 1811, when Lord
                    Grenville was organizing a prospective ministry, Horner had the offer, which he
                    refused, of a treasury secretaryship. He had resolved not to accept office till
                    he could afford to live out of office; and his professional income, on which he
                    depended, was at no time proportionate to his abilities. His labours at last
                    began to tell upon a constitution never robust, and in October 1816 his
                    physicians ordered him to Italy, where, however, he sank under his malady. He
                    died at Pisa, February 8, 1817. He was buried at Leghorn, and a marble statue by
                    Chantrey was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>Without the advantages of rank, or wealth, or even of genius, Francis Horner rose
                    to a high position of public influence and private esteem. The speeches in the
                    House of Commons on the occasion of moving for a new writ for St Mawes combine
                    with the letters of private friends in testifying to the respect and honour
                    commanded by his integrity and wide and cultured intellect, and to the affection
                    won by his sweet and noble disposition, as well as to the general regret for the
                    untimely death of one who gave promise of such abilities as a statesman. The
                    early friend of Brougham and Jeffrey in Edinburgh, and welcomed in London by
                    Romilly, Mackintosh, Abercromby, and Lord Holland, Horner was by sincere
                    conviction a Whig. His special field was political economy. Master of that
                    subject, and exercising a sort of moral as well as intellectual influence over
                    the House of Commons, he, by his nervous and earnest rather than eloquent style
                    of speaking, could fix its attention for hours on such dτy topics as finance,
                    and coinage, and currency. As chairman of the parliamentary committee for
                    investigating the depreciation of bank notes, for which he moved in 1810, he
                    extended and confirmed his fame as a political economist by his share in the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Bullion Report.</hi> It was chiefly through his efforts
                    that the paper-issue of the English banks was checked, and gold and silver
                    reinstated in their true position as circulating media; and his views on free
                    trade and commerce have been generally accepted at their really high value.
                    Horner was one of the promoters of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>
                    in 1802. His articles in the early numbers of that publication, chiefly on
                    political economy, form his only literary legacy.</p>
