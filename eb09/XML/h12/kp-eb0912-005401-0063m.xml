                <p><label type="entry">HOLBEIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hans</hi></label>, the younger
                    (1497-1543), favourite son of Hans Holbein the elder, was probably born at
                    Augsburg about the year 1497. Though Sandrart and Van Mander declare that they
                    do not know who gave him the first lessons, he doubtless received an artist’s
                    education from his father. About 1515 he left Augsburg with Ambrose his elder
                    brother to seek employment as an illustrator of books at Basel. His first patron
                    is said to have been Erasmus, for whom, shortly after his arrival, he
                    illustrated with pen-and-ink sketches an edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encomium</hi><hi rend="italic">Morioe,</hi> now in the museum of Basel. But his
                    chief occupation was that of drawing titlepage-blocks and initials for new
                    editions of the Bible and classics issued from the presses of Froben and other
                    publishers. His leisure hours, it is supposed, were devoted to the production of
                    rough painter’s work, a schoolmaster’s sign in the Basel collection, a table
                    with pictures of St Nobody in the library of the university at Zurich. Iu
                    contrast with these coarse productions, the portraits of Jacob Meyer and his
                    wife in the Basel museum, one of which purports to have been finished in 1516,
                    are miracles of workmanship. It has always seemed difficult indeed to ascribe
                    such excellent creations to Holbein’s nineteenth year; and it is hardly credible
                    that he should have been asked to do things of this kind so early, especially
                    when it is remembered that neither he nor his brother Ambrose were then allowed
                    to matriculate in the guild of Basel. Not till 1517 did Ambrose, whose life
                    otherwise remains obscure, join that corporation; Hans, not overburdened with
                    practice, wandered into Switzerland, where (1517) he was employed to paint in
                    the house of Jacob Hertenstein at Lucerne. In 1519 Holbein reappeared at Basel,
                    where he matriculated, and, there is every reason to think, married. Whether,
                    previous to this time, he took advantage of his vicinity to the Italian border
                    to cross the Alps is uncertain. Van Mander says that he never was in Italy; yet
                    the large wall-paintings which he executed after 1519 at Basel, and the series
                    of his sketches and pictures which is still extant, might lead to the belief
                    that Van Mander was misinformed. The spirit of Holbein’s compositions for the
                    Basel town-hall, the scenery and architecture of his numerous drawings, and the
                    cast of form in some of his imaginative portraits, make it more likely that he
                    should have felt the direct influence of North Italian painting than that he
                    should have taken Italian elements from imported works or prints. The Swiss at
                    this period wandered in thousands to swell the ranks of the French or imperial
                    armies fighting on Italian soil, and the road they took may have been followed
                    by Hans on a more peaceful mission. He shows himself at all events familiar with
                    Italian examples at various periods of his career; and if we accept as early
                    works the Flagellation, and the Last Supper at Basel, coarse as they are, they
                    show some acquaintance with Lombard methods of painting, whilst in other pieces,
                    such as the series of the Passion in oil in the same collection, the modes of
                    Hans Holbein the elder are agreeably commingled with a more modern, it may be
                    said Italian, polish. Again, looking at the Virgin and Man of Sorrows in the
                    Basel museum, we shall be struck by a searching metallic style akin to that of
                    the Ferrarese; and the Lais or the Venus and Amor of the same collection reminds
                    us of the Leonardesques of the school of Milan. When Holbein settled down to an
                    extensive practice at Basel in 1519, he decorated the walls of the house “Zum
                    Tanz” with simulated architectural features of a florid character after the
                    fashion of the Veronese; and his wall paintings in the town-hall, if we can
                    truly judge of them by copies, reveal an artist not unfamiliar with North
                    Italian composition, distribution, action, gesture, and expression. In his
                    drawings too, particularly in a set representing the Passion at Basel, the
                    arrangement, and also the perspective, form, and decorative ornament, are in the
                    spirit of the school of Mantegna. Contemporary with these, however, and almost
                    inexplicably in contrast with them as regards handling, are portrait-drawings
                    such as the likenesses of Jacob Meyer and his wife, which are finished with
                    German delicacy, and with a power and subtlety of hand seldom rivalled in any
                    school. Curiously enough, the same contrast maybe observed between painted
                    compositions and painted portraits. The Bonifacius Amerbach of 1519 at Basel is
                    acknowledged to be one of the most complete examples of smooth and transparent
                    handling that Holbein ever executed. His versatility at this period is shown by
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n64/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0064-0055"/> a dead Christ (1521), a corpse in profile on a
                    dissecting table, and a set of figures in couples; the Madonna and St Pantalus,
                    and Kaiser Henry with the empress Kunigunde (1522), originally composed for the
                    organ loft of the Basel cathedral, now in the Basel museum. Equally remarkable,
                    but more attractive, though injured, is the Virgin and Child between St Ursus
                    and St Nicholas (not St Martin) giving alms to a beggar, in the gallery of
                    Solothurn. This remarkable picture is dated 1522, and seems to have been ordered
                    for an altar in the minster of St Ursus of Solothurn by Nicholas Conrad, a
                    captain and statesman of the 16th century, whose family allowed the precious
                    heirloom to fall into decay in a chapel of the neighbouring village of Grenchen.
                    Numerous drawings in the spirit of this picture, and probably of the same period
                    in his career, might have led Holbein’s contemporaries to believe that he would
                    make his mark in the annals of Basel as a model for painters of altarpieces as
                    well as a model for pictorial composition and portrait. The promise which he
                    gave at this time was immense. He was gaining a freedom in draughtsmanship that
                    gave him facility to deal with any subject. Though a realist, he was sensible of
                    the dignity and severity of religious painting. His colour had almost all the
                    richness and sweetness of the Venetians. But he had fallen on evil times, as the
                    next few years undoubtedly showed. Amongst the portraits which he executed in
                    these years are those of Froben, the publisher, known only by copies at Basel
                    and Hampton Court, and Erasmus, who sat in 1523, as he likewise did in 1530, in
                    various positions, showing his face three-quarters as at Longford, Basel, Turin,
                    Parma, the Hague, and Vienna, and in profile as in the Louvre or at Hampton
                    Court. Besides these, Holbein made designs for glass windows and prints,
                    including subjects of every sort, from the Virgin and Child with saints of the
                    old time to the Dance of Death, from gospel incidents extracted from Luther’s
                    Bible to satirical pieces illustrating the sale of indulgences and other abuses
                    denounced by Reformers. Holbein, in this way, was carried irresistibly with the
                    stream of the Reformation, in which, it must now be admitted, the old traditions
                    of religious painting were wrecked, leaving nothing behind but unpictorial
                    elements which Cranach and his school vainly used for pictorial purposes.</p>
                <p>Once only, after 1526, and after he had produced the Lais and Venus and Amor, did
                    Holbein with impartial spirit give his services and pencil to the Roman Catholic
                    cause. The burgomaster Meyer, whose patronage he had already enjoyed, now asked
                    him to represent himself and his wives and children in prayer before the Virgin;
                    and Holbein produced the celebrated altarpiece now in the palace of Prince
                    William of Hesse at Darmstadt, the shape and composition of which are known to
                    all the world by its copy in the Dresden museum. The drawings for this
                    masterpiece are amongst the most precious relics in the museum of Basel. The
                    time now came when art began to suffer from unavoidable depression in all
                    countries north of the Alps. Holbein, at Basel, was reduced to accept the
                    smallest commissions—even for scutcheons. Then he saw that his chances were
                    dwindling to nothing, and taking a bold resolution, armed with letters of
                    introduction from Erasmus to More, he crossed the Channel to England, where in
                    the one-sided branch of portrait painting he found an endless circle of clients.
                    Eighty-seven drawings by Holbein in Windsor Castle, containing an equal number
                    of portraits, of persons chiefly of high quality, testify to his industry in the
                    years which divide 1528 from 1543. They are all originals of pictures that are
                    still extant, or sketches for pictures that were lost or never carried out. Sir
                    Thomas More, with whom he seems to have had a very friendly connexion, sat to
                    him for likenesses of various kinds. The drawing of his bead is at Windsor. The
                    picture from that drawing belonged, and perhaps still belongs, to Mr Huth in
                    London. A pen-and-ink sketch, in which we see More surrounded by all the members
                    of his family, is now in the gallery of Basel, and numerous copies of a picture
                    from it prove how popular the lost original must once have been. At the same
                    period were executed the portraits of Warham (Lambeth and Louvre), Wyatt
                    (Louvre), Sir Henry Guildlord and his wife (Windsor and Mr Frewen), all finished
                    in 1527, the astronomer Kratzer (Louvre), Godsalve (Dresden), and Bryan Tuke
                    (Munich) in 1528. In this year, 1528, Holbein returned to Basel, taking to
                    Erasmus the sketch of More’s family. With money which he brought from London he
                    purchased a house at Basel wherein to lodge his wife and children, whose
                    portraits he now painted with all the care of a husband and father (1528). He
                    then witnessed the flight of Erasmus and the fury of the iconoclasts, who
                    destroyed in one day almost all the religious pictures at Basel. The
                    municipality, unwilling that he should suffer again from the depression caused
                    by evil times, asked him to finish the frescos of the town-hall, and the
                    sketches from these lost pictures are still before us to show that he had not
                    lost the spirit of bis earlier days, and was still capable as a composer. His
                    Rehoboam receiving the Israelite Envoys, and Saul at the Head of his Array
                    meeting Samuel, testify to Holbein’s power and his will, also proved at a later
                    period by the Triumphs of Riches and Poverty, executed for the Steelyard in
                    London, to prefer the fame of a painter of history to that of a painter of
                    portraits. But the reforming times still remained unfavourable to art. With the
                    exception of a portrait of Melanchthon (Hanover) which he now completed, Holbein
                    found little to do at Basel. The year 1530, therefore, saw him again on the
                    move, and he landed in England for the second time with the prospect of
                    bettering his fortunes. Here indeed political changes had robbed him of his
                    earlier patrons. The circle of More and Warham was gone. But that of the
                    merchants of the Steelyard took its place, for whom Holbein executed the long
                    and important series of portraits that lie scattered throughout the galleries
                    and collections of England and the Continent, and bear date after 1532. Then
                    came again the chance of practice in more fashionable circles. In 1533 the·
                    Triumphs of Wealth and Poverty were executed, then the portraits of Leland and
                    Wyatt (Longford), and ( 1534) the portrait of Thomas Cromwell. Through Cromwell
                    Holbein probably became attached to the court, in the pay of which he appears
                    permanently after 1537. From that time onwards he was connected with all that
                    was highest in the society of London. Henry VIII. invited him to make a family
                    picture of himself, his father, and family, which obtained a post of honour at
                    Whitehall The beautiful cartoon of a part of this fine piece at Hardwicke Hall
                    enables us to gauge its beauty before the fire which destroyed it in the 17th
                    century. Then Holbein painted Jane Seymour in state (Vienna), employing some
                    English hand perhaps to make the replicas at the Hague, Sion House, and Woburn;
                    he finished the Southwell of the Uffizi (copy at the Louvre), the jeweller
                    Morett at Dresden, and last, not least, Christine of Denmark (Arundel and
                    Windsor castles), who gave sittings at Brussels in 1538. During the journey
                    which this work involved Holbein took the opportunity of revisiting Basel, where
                    he made his appearance in silk and satin, and <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi>
                    only accepted the office of town painter. He had been living long and
                    continuously away from home, not indeed observing due fidelity to his wife, who
                    still resided at Basel, but fairly performing the duties of keeping her in
                    comfort. His return to London in autumn enabled him to do homage to the king in
                    the way familiar to artists. He presented to Henry at Christmas a portrait of
                    Prince Edward. Again abroad in the summer of 1539, he painted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n65/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0065-0056"/> with great fidelity the princess Anne of Cleves,
                    at Düren near Cologne, whose form we still see depicted in the great picture of
                    the Louvre. That he could render the features of his sitter without flattery is
                    plain from this one example. Indeed, habitual flattery was contrary to his
                    habits. His portraits up to this time all display that uncommon facility for
                    seizing character which his father enjoyed before him, and which he had
                    inherited in an expanded form. No amount of labour, no laboriousness of
                    finish—and of both he was ever prodigal—betrayed him into loss of resemblance or
                    expression. No painter was ever quicker at noting peculiarities of physiognomy,
                    and it may be observed that in none of his faces, as indeed in none of the faces
                    one sees in nature, are the two sides alike. Yet he was not a child of the 16th
                    century, as the Venetians were, in substituting touch for line. We must not look
                    in his works for modulations of surface or subtle contrasts of colour in
                    juxtaposition. His method was to the very last delicate, finished, and smooth,
                    as became a painter of the old school.</p>
                <p>Amongst the more important creations of Holbein’s later time we should note his
                    Duke of Norfolk at Windsor, the hands of which are so perfectly preserved as to
                    compensate for the shrivel that now disfigures the head. Two other portraits of
                    1541 (Berlin and Vienna), the Falconer at the Hague, and John Chambers at Vienna
                    (1542), are noble specimens of portrait art; most interesting and of the same
                    year are the likenesses of Holbein himself, of which several examples are
                    extant—one particularly good at Fähna, the seat of the Stackelberg family near
                    Riga, and another at the Uffizi in Florence. Here Holbein appears to us as a man
                    of regular features, with hair just turning grey, but healthy in colour and
                    shape, and evidently well to do in the world. Yet a few months only separated
                    him then from his death-bed. He was busy painting a picture of Henry the VIII.
                    confirming the Privileges of the Barber Surgeons (Lincoln’s Inn Fields), when he
                    sickened of the plague and died after miking a will about November 1543. His
                    loss must have been seriously felt in England. Had he lived his last years in
                    Germany, he would not have changed the current which decided the fate of
                    painting in that country; he would but have shared the fate of Dürer and others
                    who merely prolonged the agony of art amidst the troubles of the Reformation.
