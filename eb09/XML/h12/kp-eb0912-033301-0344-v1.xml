                <p><label type="entry">HUDSON’S BAY COMPANY</label> is a joint-stock association
                    formed for the purpose of importing into Great Britain the furs and skins which
                    it obtains, chiefly by barter, from the Indians of British North America. The
                    trading forts of the company are dotted over the immense region (excluding
                    Canada Proper and Alaska) which is bounded E. and W. by the Atlantic and Pacific
                    Oceans, and N. and S. by the Arctic Ocean and the United States. From these
                    forts the furs are despatched by boat or canoe to York Fort on Hudson’s Bay,
                    whence they are shipped to England to be sold by auction.</p>
                <p>In the year 1670 Charles IT. granted a charter to Prince Rupert and seventeen
                    other noblemen and gentlemen, incorporating them as the “Governor and Company of
                    Adventurers of England trading into Hudson’s Bay,” and securing to them “the
                    sole trade and commerce of all those seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes, creeks,
                    and sounds, in whatsoever latitude they shall be, that lie within the entrance
                    of the straits commonly called Hudson’s Straits, together with all the lands and
                    territories upon the countries, coasts, and confines of the seas, bays, &amp;c.,
                    aforesaid, that are not already actually possessed by or granted to any of our
                    subjects, or possessed by the subjects of any other Christian prince or state.”
                    Besides the complete lordship and entire legislative, judicial, and executive
                    power within these vague limits (which the company finally agreed to accept as
                    meaning all lands watered by streams flowing into Hudson’s Bay), the corporation
                    received also the right to “the whole and entire trade and traffic to and from
                    all havens, bays, creeks, rivers, lakes, and seas into which they shall find
                    entrance or passage by water or land out of the territories, limits, or places
                    aforesaid.” The first settlements in the country thus granted, which was to be
                    known as Rupert’s Land, were made on James’s Bay and at Churchhill and Hayes
                    rivers; but it was long before there was any advance into the interior, for in
                    1749, when an unsuccessful attempt was made in parliament to deprive the company
                    of its charter on the plea of “non-user,” it had only some four or five forts on
                    the coast, with about 120 regular employes. Although the commercial success of
                    the enterprise was from the first immense, great losses, amounting before 1700
                    to £215,514, were inflicted on the company by the French, who sent several
                    military expeditions against the forts. After the cession of Canada to Great
                    Britain in 1763, numbers of fur-traders spread over that country, and into the
                    northwestern parts of the continent, and began even to encroach on the Hudson’s
                    Bay Company’s territories. These individual speculators finally combined into
                    the North-West Fur Company of Montreal, of which Washington Irving has given an
                    interesting description in his <hi rend="italic">Astoria.</hi> The fierce
                    competition which at once sprang up between the companies was marked by features
                    which sufficiently demonstrate the advantages of a monopoly in commercial
                    dealings with savages, even although it is the manifest interest of the
                    monopolists to retard the advance of civilization towards their hunting grounds.
                    The Indians were demoralized, body and soul, by the abundance of ardent spirits
                    with which the rival traders sought to attract them to themselves; the supply of
                    furs threatened soon to be exhausted by the indiscriminate slaughter, even
                    during the breeding season, of both male and female animals; the worst passions
                    of both whites and Indians were inflamed to their fiercest, and costly
                    destruction of human life and property was the result (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Red River Settlement).</hi> At last, in 1821, the companies, mutually
                    exhausted, amalgamated, obtaining a licence to hold for 21 years the monopoly of
                    trade in the vast regions lying to the west and north-west of the older
                    company’s grant. In 1838 Hudson’s Bay Company acquired the sole rights for
                    itself, and obtained a new licence, also for 21 years. On the expiry of this, it
                    was not renewed, and since 1859 the district has been open to all, the Hudson’s
                    Bay Company having no special advantages beyond its tried and splendid
                    organization. The licences to trade did not of course affect the original
                    possessions of the company. These it retained till 1869, when they were
                    transferred to the British Government for £300,000; in 1870 they were
                    incorporated with the Dominion of Canada. The company, which now trades entirely
                    as a private corporation, still retains one-twentieth of the entire grant,
                    together with valuable blocks of land round the various forts; and these
                    possessions will doubtless, as the country becomes opened up and colonized,
                    yield a considerable revenue at some future time.</p>
