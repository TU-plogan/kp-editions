                    minor prophets. The name Hosea LXX. Ώστ?«, Vulg. <hi rend="italic">Osee,</hi>
                    and so our English version in Rom. ix. 25) ought rather to be written Hoshea,
                    and is identical with that borne by the last king of Ephraim, and by Joshua in
                    Num. xiii. 16, Deut, xxxii. 44. Of the life of Hosea we know nothing beyond what
                    can be gathered from his prophecies. That he was a citizen of the northern
                    kingdom appears from the whole tenor of the book, but most expressly from i. 2,
                    where “the land,” the prophet’s land, is the realm of Israel, and vii. 5, where
                    “our king” is the king of Samaria. The date at which Hosea flourished is given
                    in the title, i. 1, by the reigning kings of Judah and Israel. He prophesied (1)
                    in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah; (2) in the
                    days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. As Jeroboam II. died in the
                    lifetime of Uzziah, these two determinations of the period of Hosea’s prophetic
                    activity are not strictly coincident, and a question arises whether both are
                    from the same hand or of equal authority. There is no doubt that the date of
                    Jeroboam II. applies to chaps, i. and ii., which were written before the
                    downfall of the dynasty of Jehu (i. 4), and while the nation was still enjoying
                    the prosperity that distinguished Jeroboam’s reign. On the other hand, it seems
                    equally certain that chaps, iv.-xiv. are in their present form a continuous
                    composition dating from the period of anarchy subsequent to that king’s death.
                    Thus it seems natural to suppose, with Ewald and other scholars, that the name
                    of Jeroboam originally stood in a special title to chaps, i., ii. (or to these
                    along with chap, iii.), which was afterwards extended to a general heading for
                    the whole book by the insertion of the words “of Uzziah . . . . and in the days
                    of.” As Hosea himself can hardly be supposed to have thus converted a special
                    title into a general one, the scholars who take this view suppose further that
                    the date by Judaean reigns was added by a later hand, the same perhaps which
                    penned the identical date in the title to Isaiah. On this view the Judaean date
                    merely expresses knowledge on the part of some Hebrew scribe that Hosea was a
                    contemporary of Isaiah. The plausibility of this hypothesis is greatly increased
                    by the fact that there does not appear to be anything in the book of Hosea that
                    is clearly as late as the reign of Hezekiah. On the contrary, the latter part of
                    the book seems to have been written before the expedition of Tiglath Pileser
                    against Pekah in the days of Ahaz. In that war Gilead and Galilee were conquered
                    and depopulated (2 Kings xv. 29), but Hosea repeatedly refers to these districts
                    as still forming an integral part of the kingdom of Israel (v. 1, vi. 8, xii.
                    11; contrast Micah vii. 14). Assyria is never referred to as a hostile power,
                    but as a dangerous ally, from which some of the godless Ephraimites were ready
                    to seek the help which another party expected from Egypt, but which in truth was
                    to be found only in Jehovah (v. 13, vii. 11, viii. 9, xii. 1, xiv. 3). This
                    picture precisely corresponds with what we read in 2 Kings xv. of the internal
                    dissensions which rent the northern kingdom after the fall of the house of Jehu,
                    when Menahem called in the Assyrians to help him against those who challenged
                    his pretensions to the throne. Under Pekah of Israel, and Ahaz his contemporary
                    in Judah, the political situation was altogether changed. Israel was in alliance
                    with Damascus, and Assyria made open war on the allies (2 Kings xvi.). This new
                    situation may be said to mark a crisis in the history of Old Testament prophecy,
                    for to it we owe the magnificent series of Isaiah’s Assyrian discourses (Isa.
                    vii. <hi rend="italic">seq.).</hi> But the events which stirred Judaean prophets
                    so deeply have left no trace in the book in which Hosea sums up the record of
                    his teaching. He foresees that captivity and desolation lie in the future, but
                    even in his last words of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0307-0296"/> pathetic exhortation he speaks to a nation which
                    looks to Assyria for help and victory (xiv. 3). The received chronology of the
                    kings of Judah and Israel is notoriously precarious, and a comparison of the
                    Assyrian monuments and eponym lists with the Biblical .data makes it probable
                    that the period from the accession of Zachariah, son of Jeroboam II., to the
                    fall of Samaria must be shortened by as much as twenty years, and that the
                    interregnum which is commonly supposed to have followed Jeroboam’s death must
                    also be cancelled. This correction may be held to remove one difficulty in the
                    title of our book, which on the current chronology assigns to Hosea some sixty
                    years of prophetic activity. On the other hand, most Assyriologists agree that
                    the expedition of Sennacherib, which fell in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah (2
                    Kings xviii. 13), took place in 701 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In that case
                    Hezekiah did not come to the throne till after the fall of Samaria (722-719);
                    which the book of Hosea predicts as a future occurrence (ch. xiii. 16)—another
                    argument against the authority of the title. There is still, however, a large
                    element of uncertainty in the reconstruction of Hebrew chronology by the aid of
                    the monuments. One date bearing on our book may be taken as certain, viz., the
                    war of Tiglith Pileser with Pekah in 734, and, according to our argument, Hosea
                    committed his prophecies to writing before that year.<note anchored="true"

                    more exact determination of the date of the book has been sought by comparing
                    viii. 9, 10, with the statement on the monuments that Tiglath Pileser received
                    tribute from King Menahem (Minhimmi) of Samaria in 738 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    first time. The narrative in 2 Kings xv. 19 seems to indicate that the relations
                    of Menahem to Assyria began earlier in his reign,<note anchored="true"

                <p>To sum up, the first part of Hosea’s prophetic work, corresponding to chaps
                    i.-iii., lay in the years of external prosperity immediately preceding the
                    catastrophe of the house of Jehu in or near the year 750. The second part of the
                    book is a summary of prophetic teaching during the subsequent troublous reign of
                    Menahem, and must have been completed before 734 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Apart from the narrative in chaps i.-iii., to which we shall presently recur,
                    the book throws little or no light on the details of Hosea’s life. It appears
                    from ix. 7, 8, that his prophetic work was greatly embarrassed by opposition,
                    “As for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the
                    house of his God.” The enmity which had its centre in the sanctuary probably
                    proceeded from the priests (comp. Amos vii.), against whose profligacy and
                    profanation of their office our prophet frequently declaims—perhaps also from
                    the degenerate prophetic guilds which had their seats in the holy cities of the
                    northern kingdom, and with whom Hosea’s elder contemporary Amos so indignantly
                    refuses to be identified (Amos vii. 14). In chap. iv. 5 Hosea seems to comprise
                    priests and prophets in one condemnation, thus placing himself in direct
                    antagonism to all the leaders of the religious life of his nation. Under such
                    circumstances, and amidst the universal dissolution of social order and morality
                    to which every page of his book bears testimony, the prophet was driven to the
                    verge of despair (ix. 7), and only the sovereign conviction of Jehovah’s
                    infinite love and tender compassion to His people, even in their faithlessness
                    and sin, upheld him in the sure hope of the final repentance and restoration of
                    Israel, which finds such exquisitely pathetic expression in the closing
                    sentences of his prophecy. The hypothesis of Ewald, that he was at last
                    compelled by persecution to retire from the northern kingdom, and composed his
                    book in Judea, rests mainly on an improbable exegesis of several passages, and
                    derives no valid support .from the fact that the prophet, to whom the ideal
                    unity of all the tribes of Jacob and the legitimate sovereignty of the house of
                    David are cardinal doctrines, follows the house of Judah with constant interest
                    and growing acquaintance with its internal condition.</p>
                <p>The most interesting problem of Hosea’s history lies in the interpretation of the
                    story of his married life (chaps.</p>
                <p>i. -iii.). We read in these chapters that God’s revelation to Hosea began when in
                    accordance with a divine command he married a profligate wife Gomer, the
                    daughter of Diblaim. Three children were born in this marriage and received
                    symbolical names, illustrative of the divine purpose towards Israel, which are
                    expounded in chap. i. In chap.</p>
                <p>ii. the faithlessness of Israel to Jehovah, the long-suffering of God, the moral
                    discipline of sorrow and tribulation by which He will yet bring back His erring
                    people and betroth it to Himself for ever in righteousness, love, and truth, are
                    depicted under the figure of the relation of a husband to an erring spouse. The
                    suggestion of this allegory lies in the prophet’s marriage with Gomer, but the
                    details are worked out quite independently, and under a rich multiplicity of
                    figures derived from other sources. In the third chapter we return to the
                    personal experience of the prophet. His faithless wife had at length left him
                    and fallen, under circumstances which are not detailed, into a state of misery,
                    from which Hosea, still following her with tender affection, and encouraged by a
                    divine command, brought her back and restored her to his house, where he kept
                    her in seclusion, and patiently watched over her for many days, yet not
                    readmitting her to the privileges of a wife.</p>
                <p>In these experiences the prophet again recognizes a parallel to Jehovah’s
                    long-suffering love to Israel, and the discipline by which the people shall be
                    brought back to God through a period in which all their political and religious
                    institutions are overthrown. Throughout these chapters personal narrative and
                    prophetic allegory are interwoven with a rapidity of transition very puzzling to
                    the modern reader; but an unbiassed exegesis can hardly fail to acknowledge that
                    chaps, i. and iii. narrate an actual passage in the prophet’s life. The names of
                    the three children are symbolical, but Isaiah in like manner gave symbolical
                    names to his sons, embodying prominent points in his prophetic teaching
                    (Shear-jashub, Isa. vii. 3, comp. X. 21; Maher-shalal-hash-baz, viii. 3). And
                    the name of Gomer bath Diblaim is certainly that of an actual person, upon which
                    all the allegorists, from the Targum, Jerome, and Ephrem Syrus downwards, have
                    spent their arts in vain, whereas the true symbolical names in the book are
                    perfectly easy of interpretation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    a conception of the way in which the Divine word was communicated to the
                    prophets. There is no reason to suppose that Hosea knowingly married a woman of
                    profligate character. The point of the allegory in i. 2 is plainly infidelity
                    after marriage as a parallel to Israel’s departure from the covenant God, and a
                    profligate wife (D'3UT ΠK <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> K) is not the same
                    thing with an open prostitute (∏Jlτ)∙ The marriage was marred by Gomer’s
                    infidelity; and the struggle of Hosea’s affection for his wife with this great
                    unhappiness—a struggle inconceivable unless his first love had been pure and
                    full of trust in the purity of its object —furnished him with a new insight into
                    Jehovah’s dealings with Israel. Then he recognized that the great calamity of
                    his life was God’s own ordinance and appointed means to communicate to him a
                    deep prophetic lesson. The recognition of a divine command after the fact has
                    its parallel, as Wellhausen observes, in Jeremiah xxxii. 8.</p>
                <p>This explanation of the narrative, which is essentially Ewald’s, has commended
                    itself to not a few recent expositors, as Valeton, Wellhausen, and Nowack. It
                    has the great advantage of supplying a psychological key to the conception of
                    Israel or the land of Israel (i. 2) as the spouse of Jehovah, which dominates
                    these chapters, but in the later part of the book gives way to the
                    personification of the nation as God’s son. This conception has, indeed, formal
                    points of contact with notions previously current, and even with the ideas of
                    Semitic heathenism. On the one hand, it is a standing Hebrew usage to represent
                    the land as mother of its people, while the representation of worshippers as
                    children of their god is found in Num. xxi. 29, where the Moabites are called
                    children of Chemosh, and is early and widespread throughout the Semitic field
                    <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="italic">Trans. Bib. Arch.,</hi> vi. p. 438;
                    <hi rend="italic">Jour, of Phil.,</hi> ix. p. 82). The combination of these two
                    notions gives at once the conception of the national deity as husband of the
                    land. On the other hand, the designation of Jehovah as Baal, which, in
                    accordance with the antique view of marriage, means husband as well as lord and
                    owner, was current among the Israelites in early times (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    probable that among the idolatrous Israelites the idea of a marriage between the
                    deity and individual worshippers was actually current and connected with the
                    immorality which Hosea often condemns in the worship of the local Baalim, whom
                    the ignorant people identified with Jehovah. For we have a Punic woman’s name,
                    “the betrothed of</p>
                <p>Baal” (Euting, <hi rend="italic">Panische Steine,</hi> pp. 9, 15), and a similar
                    conception existed among the Babylonians (Herod., i. 181, 182). But Hosea takes
                    the idea of Jehovah as husband, and gives it an altogether different turn,
                    filling it with a new and profound meaning, based on the psychical experiences
                    of a deep human affection in contest with outraged honour and the wilful
                    self-degradation of a spouse. It can hardly be supposed that all that lies in
                    these chapters is an abstract study in the psychology of the emotions. It is
                    actual human experience that gives Hosea the key to divine truth. Among those
                    who do not recognize this view of the passage, the controversy between allegory
                    and literalism is carried on chiefly upon abstract assumptions. The extreme
                    literalists, of whom Dr Pusey may be taken as the modern representative in
                    England, will have it that the divine command justified a marriage otherwise
                    highly improper, and that the offensive circumstances magnify the obedience of
                    the prophet. This is to substitute the Scotist and Neo-Platonic notion of God
                    for that of Scripture. On the other hand, the allegorists, vho argue that God
                    could not have enjoined on His prophet a marriage plainly improper and fitted to
                    destroy his influence among the people, are unable to show that what is
                    repulsive in fact is fit subject for a divine allegory. A third school of recent
                    writers, led by Hengstenberg, and resting on a thesis of John Smith, the
                    Cambridge Platonist, will have it that the symbolical action was transacted in
                    what they allow themselves by a <hi rend="italic">contradictio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">adjecto</hi> to call an objective vision.
                    This view has been adopted by Fairbairn <hi rend="italic">{Prophecy,</hi> ch. v.
                    sec. ii. ). The recent Continental literature of the controversy is catalogued
                    by Nowack in his <hi rend="italic">Commentary,</hi> p. xxxvi.</p>
                <p>It was in the experiences of his married life, and in the spiritual lessons
                    opened to him through these, that Hosea first heard the revealing voice of
                    Jehovah (i. 2). Like Amos (Amos iii. 8), he was called to speak for God by an
                    inward constraining voice, and there is no reason to think that he had any
                    connexion with the recognized prophetic societies, or ever received such outward
                    adoption to office as was given to Elisha. His position in Israel was one of
                    tragic isolation. Amos, when he had discharged his mission at Bethel, could
                    return to his home and to his friends; Hosea was a stranger among his own
                    people, and his home was full of sorrow and shame. Isaiah in the gloomiest days
                    of Judah’s declension had faithful disciples about him, and knew that there was
                    a believing remnant in the land. Hosea knows no such remnant, and there is not a
                    line in his prophecy from which we can conclude that his words ever found an
                    obedient ear. For him the present condition of the people contained no germ or
                    pledge of future amendment, and he describes the impending judgment, not as a
                    sifting process (Amos ix. 9, 10) in which the wicked perish and the righteous
                    remain, but as the total wreck of the nation which has wholly turned aside from
                    its God. In truth, while the idolatrous feasts of Ephraim still ran their joyous
                    round, while the careless people crowded to the high places, and there in
                    unbridled and licentious mirth flattered themselves that their many sacrifices
                    ensured the help of their God against all calamity, the nation was already in
                    the last stage of internal dissolution. To the prophet’s eye there was “no
                    truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land—nought but swearing, and
                    lying, and killing, and stealing, and adultery; they break out, and blood
                    toucheth blood” (iv. 1, 2). The root of this corruption lay in total ignorance
                    of Jehovah, whose precepts were no longer taught by the priests, while in the
                    national calf-worship, and in the local high places, this worship was confounded
                    with the service of the Canaanite Baalim. Thus the whole religious constitution
                    of Israel was undermined. And the political state of the realm was in Hosea’s
                    eyes not more hopeful. The dynasty of Jehu, still great and powerful when the
                    prophet’s labours began, is itself an incorporation of national sin. Founded on
                    the bloodshed of Jezreel, it must fall by God’s vengeance, and the state shall
                    fall with it (i. 4, iii. 4). This sentence stands at the head of Hosea’s
                    predictions, and throughout the book the civil constitution of Ephraim is
                    represented as equally lawless and godless with the corrupt religious
                    establishment. The anarchy that followed on the murder of Zachariah appears to
                    the prophet as the natural decadence of a realm not founded on divine ordinance.
                    The nation had rejected Jehovah, the only helper. And now the avenging Assyrian
                    is at hand. Samaria’s king shall pass away as foam on the water. Fortress and
                    city shall fall before the ruthless invader, who spares neither age nor sex, and
                    thistles shall cover the desolate altars of Ephraim. But the ultimate theme of
                    all prophecy is not judgment but redeeming love, and the deepest thought of
                    every Hebrew seer is the sovereignty of Jehovah’s grace in Israel’s sin. Hosea
                    could discern no faithful remnant in Ephraim, yet Ephraim in all his corruption
                    is the son of Jehovah, a child nurtured with tender love, a chosen people, whose
                    past history declares in every episode the watchful and patient affection of his
                    father. And that father is God and not man, the Holy One who will not and cannot
                    sacrifice His love even to the justest indignation (chap, xi.). To the prophet
                    who knows this love of Jehovah, who has learned to understand it in the like
                    experience of his own life, the very ruin of the state of Israel is a step in
                    the loving guidance which makes the valley of trouble a door of hope (ii. 15),
                    and the wilderness of tribulation as full of promise as the desert road from
                    Egypt to Canaan was to Israel of old. Of the manner of Israel’s repentance and
                    conversion Hosea presents no clear image, nay, it is plain that on this point he
                    had nothing to tell. The certainty that the people will at length return and
                    seek Jehovah their God and David their king rests, not on any germ of better
                    things in Israel, but on the invincible supremacy of Jehovah’s love. And so the
                    two sides of his prophetic declaration, the passionate denunciation of Israel’s
                    sin and folly, and the not less passionate <pb break="no"

                    victory of divine love, are united by no logical bond. The unity is one of
                    feeling only, and the sob of anguish in which many of his appeals to a heedless
                    people seem to end, turns once and again with sudden revulsion into the clear
                    accents of evangelical promise, which in the closing chapter swell forth in pure
                    and strong cadence out of a heart that has found its rest with God from all the
                    troubles of a stormy life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Traditions about Hosea.—</hi> Beêrî, the prophet’s father, is
                    identified by the Rabbins with Beêrah (1 Chron. v. 6), a Reubenite prince
                    carried captive by Tiglath Pileser. This view is already expressed by Jerome,
                    <hi rend="italic">Quaest.</hi><hi rend="italic">in Paralip</hi>, and doubtless
                    underlies the statement of the Targum to Chronicles that Beêrah was a prophet.
                    For it is a Jewish maxim that when a prophet’s father is named, he too was a
                    prophet, and accordingly a tradition of R. Simon makes Isa. viii. 19, 20 a
                    prophecy of Beêrî (Kimchi <hi rend="italic">in loc.; Leviticus Rabba,</hi> par.
                    15). According to the usual Christian tradition, however, Hosea was of the tribe
                    of Issachar, and from an unknown town, Belemoth or Belemon (pseudo-Epiphanius,
                    pseudo-Dorotheus, Ephrem Syr., ii. 234; <hi rend="italic">Chron.</hi><hi

                    tradition adds that he died there, and was buried in peace, the source of the
                    story lies. probably in some holy place shown as his grave. There are other
                    traditions as to the burial-place of Hosea. A Jewish legend in the <hi
