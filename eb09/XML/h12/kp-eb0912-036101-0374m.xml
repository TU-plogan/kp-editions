                    second factor of the dual Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, is an extensive country
                    in the south-eastern portion of Central Europe, lying between 44° 10' and 49°
                    35' N. lat. and between 14° 25' and 26° 25' E. long. It thus covers about 5
                    degrees of latitude and 12 of longitude, and contains an area of 124,234 square
                    miles, or more than half of the whole Austrian-Hungarian realm, being larger

                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Austria</hi> (vol. iii. pp. 115-141) the
                    Austrian-Hungarian monarchy has already been treated of as a whole, and under
                    the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Croatia and Slavonia</hi> (vol. vi. pp.
                    591-592) will be found further special information with reference to that
                    province (see also <hi rend="smallcaps">Fiume,</hi> vol. ix. p. 273). In the
                    present article we shall therefore treat generally of the lands belonging to the
                    Hungarian crown, and more particularly of the “mother country,” or Hungary
                    Proper and Transylvania.</p>
                <p>The province of Hungary Proper and Transylvania, now united under one
                    administration, and sometimes officially styled simply “Hungary,” lies between
                    44° 30' and 49° 35' N. lat. and between 16° and 26° 25' E. long., and comprises
                    an area of 108,263 English square miles. It is bounded on the N. by Moravia,
                    Silesia, and Galicia; on the E. by Bukowina and Moldavia; on the S. by
                    Wallachia, Servia, and Croatia and Slavonia; and on the W. by Styria, Lower
                    Austria, and Moravia. The narrow strip of country known as the Military
                    Frontier, which stretches as a border line between Bosnia and Servia and the
                    south of Croatia and Slavonia, prior to 1873 extended beyond the limits of that
                    province, through Hungary Proper to Transylvania. The whole Military Frontier
                    thus constituted formerly a joint crown land, consisting of the present
                    Croatian-Slavonian frontier, and the so-called Servian-Bânât frontier, now
                    incorporated into the province of Hungary Proper and Transylvania. The political
                    changes introduced between 1868 and 1876 will be considered below.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the short extent of seaboard on the Adriatic belonging to
                    the Hungarian Littorale, the Hungarian monarchy is entirely surrounded by other
                    countries. Its natural boundaries are for the most part well defined: on the
                    N.W. and N. it is separated from Moravia, Silesia, and Galicia by the Carpathian
                    mountains; on the E. and S.E. the Eastern Carpathians form a natural barrier
                    between Transylvania and Moldavia and Wallachia; on the S. it is bounded by the
                    Danube, Save, and Unna, which separate it from Servia and Bosnia; on the S.W. by
                    Dalmatia and the Adriatic; and on the W., where its natural boundaries are not
                    so ’ clearly marked, by Carniola, Styria, and Lower Austria. From the riveι
                    Lajta or Leitha, which, like the March, forms a portion of the boundary of the
                    last-mentioned province, originate the terms Cisleithan and Translei than,
                    sometimes applied to the collective provinces of Austria and of Hungary
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>The mountains of Hungary belong to the two great European systems, the
                    Carpathians and the Alps. The former extend in a semicircular form over the
                    north and east of the monarchy, enclosing the whole of the left basin of the
                    Danube from Dévény near Pozsony (Pressburg) to Orsova, while spurs of the
                    Styrian Alps traverse the country in the west; to these latter belong also the
                    Bakony and Vértes ranges. The Central Carpathians consist of several groups,
                    among which the Tâtra mountains form the most imposing mass, having an average
                    elevation of about 6000 feet, and attaining at some points an altitude of over
                    8000 feet. To the south of these are the various ranges of the Hungarian
                    Ore-Mountains or Erzgebirge (Liptô, Zôlyom, Bars, Hont), and the midland chains
                    which connect the Carpathians with the Styrian Alps. The Eastern Carpathians and
                    Transylvanian highlands cover the greater part of Transylvania, and the eastern
                    portion of the old Servian-Bânât; the Fogaras is the highest group, some crests
                    of which, as, for instance, the Négoj, Bucsesd, and Vurfu Ourla, attain an
                    elevation of between 8000 and 9000 feet. The low western mountains of Hungary
                    which traverse Croatia and Slavonia belong to the Julian Alps. Taking a general
                    survey, it will be observed that the greatest elevations are in the north of
                    Hungary Proper, in the east and south of Transylvania, and in the eastern
                    portion of the Bânât. In the Northern Carpathians large plateaus are not
                    unfrequent, but in Transylvania the Alpine character predominates. The sides of
                    the Carpathians are generally covered with forests to a considerable height, and
                    on some favourable slopes barley, oats, wheat, and rye are cultivated. The
                    mountainous lands in the south-west of the Hungarian monarchy are in elevation
                    much inferior to those in the north and east, but their greater proximity to the
                    sea and their frequently bare and rugged character cause them to have a
                    considerable influence both on the climate and commercial relations of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>The great Carpathian and Alpine mountain systems enclose two extensive plains,
                    the smaller of which, called the “Little Hungarian Alföld” or “Pressburg Basin,”
                    covers an area of about 6000 square miles, and lies to the west of the Bakony
                    and Mâtra ranges, which separate it from the “Pest Basin” or “Great Hungarian
                    Alföld.” This is the largest plain in Europe, and comprises an area of about
                    37,000 square miles, with an average elevation of from 300 to 350 feet above the
                    level of the sea. The Pest Basin extends over the greater portion 'of central
                    and southern Hungary, and is traversed by the Theiss and its numerous
                    tributaries. This immense tract of low land, though in some parts covered with
                    barren wastes of sand, alternating with marshes, presents in general a very rich
                    and productive soil. The monotonous aspect of the Alföld is in summer time
                    varied by the <hi rend="italic">déli-bàb,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fata
                    Morgana.</hi></p>
                <p>The geological constitution of the mountains of Hungary is on the whole similar
                    to that of the Alps.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    in some places composed of granite, on which crystalline schists are superposed;
                    in other places the rocks are of Mesozoic age, and associated with Tertiary
                    beds. Whilst <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0375-0362"/> the Palaeozoic formations are of comparatively
                    rare occurrence, the Mesozoic attain a very considerable development. These
                    latter in part crop out at the base of the granite and schistose mountain
                    masses, or themselves are the nucleus of more extensive ranges. In some
                    neighbourhoods independent mountain groups are formed by Tertiary strata.
                    Alluvial formations constitute the general external crust out of which the
                    mountains arise. Recent formations on the banks of rivers, more especially in
                    the south at the junction of the Danube, Theiss, Ternes, Drave, and Save, are
                    mainly confined to the tracts subject to the inundations of the same, but are
                    here and there, as in the neighbourhood of Pest, Totis, Esztergom (Gran), and
                    some parts of the Great Alföld, represented by accumulations of driftsand; and
                    in other places, as for instance on the left bank of the lake of Totis, and at
                    Szomod in Komârom county, there are deposits of calcareous tufa.</p>
                <p>The numerous caverns deserve a passing notice. One of them, the Aggtelek cave, in
                    the county of Gömör, is about 50 feet in breadth by 16 in height, and extends in
                    its recesses for a length of several thousand feet. In it various fossil
                    mammalian remains have been found. The Fonâcza cave, in the county of Bihar, has
                    also yielded fossils. No less remarkable are the Okno, Vodi, and Deményfalva
                    caverns in the county of Liptô, the Veterani in the Bânât, and the ice cave at
                    Dobsina in Gömör county. Of the many interesting caverns in Transylvania the
                    most remarkable are the sulphureous Büdös in the county of Hâromszék, the Almâs
                    to the south of Udvarhely, and the brook-traversed rocky caverns of
                    Csetate-Boli, Pestere, and Ponor in the southern mountains of Hunyad county.</p>
                <p>Nature has amply provided the greater part of Hungary with both rivers and
                    springs, but some trachytic and limestone mountainous districts show a marked
                    deficiency in this respect. The Mâtra group, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is
                    poorly supplied, while the outliers of the Vértes mountains towards the Danube
                    are almost entirely wanting in streams, and have but few water sources. A
                    relative scarcity in running waters prevails in the whole region between the
                    Danube and the Drave. The greatest proportionate deficiency, however, is
                    observable in the arenaceous region between the Danube and Theiss, where for the
                    most part only periodical floods occur. This, however, is far from being the
                    case in the north and east of the kingdom, where the rivers and streams are
                    numerous. The misfortune is that the rivers of Hungary nearly all flow either
                    mediately or immediately to the Danube, and are therefore not available in any
                    other direction as a means of external communication, and even within the
                    country can only serve to a limited extent as water-ways. Thus the Theiss, the
                    greatest wholly native river, is at the present time serviceable for regular
                    steam navigation only as far as Szolnok, while the Maros cannot be navigated
                    except at certain seasons and for a portion of its course; the Drave and the
                    Save, in like manner, are only partly available for steam vessels. But although
                    the length of permanent water-way in Hungary might be much increased by means of
                    canals and other improvements, the Danube must still remain the only river
                    communication with foreign countries, either by way of Austria or the Black Sea,
                    on account of the insurmountable obstacles to connecting the small extent of
                    Hungarian seaboard with the regions through which the Danube flows. This river,
                    which is navigable during the whole of its course through Hungary, enters the
                    monarchy at Dévény near Pressburg, and leaves it at Orsova on the Turkish
                    frontier, receiving numerous tributaries in its course, among which are, on the
                    right, the Raab, Drave, and Save, and, on the left, Waag, Neutra, Gran, Eipel,
                    Theiss, Ternes, and Czerna. The breadth of the Danube is about 900 feet near its
                    entrance, 1400 at Budapest. 1800 at Fôldvâr, and 3500 near Pétervârad
                    (Peterwardein). Among the extensive islands formed by branches of the Danube are
                    the Great Schiitt and the Csepel in its upper course. The Theiss, the greatest
                    tributary of the Danube, rises in the north-east, in the county of Mâramaros,
                    and flowing first in a north-westerly and afterwards in a southerly direction
                    ultimately joins the main river near Tittel, draining in its course the Great
                    Hungarian Plain. Amongst the many affluents of the Theiss are (r.) the Bodrog,
                    Sajö, and Zagyva, and (Z.) the Szamos, Körös, and the Maros, which last, after
                    traversing Transylvania and eastern Hungary, joins the Theiss at Szeged. The
                    Save, rising in Carniola, winds through Croatia, is fed by the Unna and Kulpa,
                    and falls into the Danube at Belgrade. It will be observed that the whole river
                    system of Hungary belongs to the Danube or the Theiss,—the Poprâd, which runs
                    through the county of Szepes (Zips), alone having a northerly course, and
                    flowing to the Dunajec, an affluent of the Vistula. The south-western or
                    Trans-Danubian division of Hungary Proper, although comparatively meagre in
                    water-courses, includes the two principal lakes.</p>
                <p>The Balaton or Platten-See, the largest lake, not only in Hungary, but in the
                    whole of the Austrian-Hungarian dominions, lies between the counties of
                    Veszprém, Somogy, and Zala, is about 47 miles in length by 3 to 9 in breadth,
                    and with the surrounding marshes occupies an area of about 400 square miles. It
                    is supplied by the river Zala, 31 small streams, and 9 springs, while its
                    surplus waters are carried off by the Sio. Phenomena peculiar to the Balaton
                    lake are, that it sometimes becomes violently agitated without any apparent
                    cause, and that in seasons of severe cold the ice on its surface occasionally
                    bursts with a loud report. It is navigable for steamers, and abounds in fish.
                    The Fertö or Neusiedler See lies in the counties of Moson and Sopron, and with
                    the Hansâg marsh covers an area of some 130 square miles; it is about 23 miles
                    in length by 6 to 8 in breadth, is very shallow, and its waters are strongly
                    impregnated with salt and soda. In 1865 the bed became almost dry, but since
                    1870 it has filled again. The other lowland lakes, as, for instance, the Palics
                    near Szabadka (Maria-Theresiopel) and the Velencze in the county of Fehér, are
                    much smaller. Morasses and pools are generally frequent in the vicinity of the
                    Danube and Theiss. The most extensive marshy region is the Sârrét, which covers
                    a considerable portion of the counties of Jâsz-Kun-Szolnok, Békés, and Bihar.
                    The Ecsedi Lâp in the county of Szatmâr is now for the most •part drained; and
                    the Alibunâr and Illancsa marshes in the county of Torontâl will also be soon
                    laid dry. Many thousands of acres of marsh land have already been reclaimed in
                    Hungary, and hydraulic operations bid fair to still further reduce the extent of
                    the marshy districts. In the deep hollows between the peaks of the Carpathians
                    are to be found the curious mountain lakes called “eyes of the sea of these
                    there are at least thirty-eight in the Tâtra alone.</p>
                <p>The canals of Hungary are still far from sufficient for the wants of the country,
                    although lately many improvements have been introduced, and enormous cuttings
                    made in certain places to relieve the rivers from periodical overflow. The most
                    important canal is the Ferencz or “Francis,” which traverses the county of Bâcs.
                    It is some 70 miles in length, and shortens very considerably the passage
                    between the Theiss and the Danube. A branch of this canal called Uj Csatorna, or
                    “New Channel,” extends from Kis-Sztapâr, a few miles below Zombor, to Ujvidék
                    opposite Peterwardein. The Béga canal runs from Nagy-Becskerek, in the county of
                    Torontâl, to beyond Temesvâr, but is not navigable throughout. Among other
                    canals are the Versecz in the county of Ternes; the Berzava <pb break="no"

                    connects the Balaton with the Danube; the Kapos or Zichy in the counties of
                    Somogy, Baranya, and Tolna; and the Sdrviz or Nâdor, which runs through the
                    counties of Fehér and Tolna.</p>
                <p>On the Adriatic, at the northern extremity of the short line of sea-coast known
                    as the “Hungarian Littorale,” lies the port of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fiume</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi> which is the only direct outlet by sea
                    for the produce of Hungary. Its commanding position at the head of the Gulf of
                    Quarnero, and spacious new harbour works, as also its immediate connexions with
                    both the Austrian and Hungarian railway systems, render it specially
                    advantageous as a commercial port. As shipping stations, Buccari, Portoré,
                    Selce, Novi, Zengg, Cirquenizza, San Giorgio, Stinizza, Jablanac, and Carlopago
                    are of comparative insignificance. The whole of the short Hungarian seaboard is
                    mountainous, and subject to violent winds.</p>
                <p>The climate of Hungary, owing to the physical configuration of the country,
                    varies considerably. If we except Transylvania, three separate zones are roughly
                    distinguishable :—the “highland,” comprising the counties in the vicinity of the
                    Northern and Eastern Carpathians, where the winters are very severe and continue
                    for half the year; the “intermediate” zone, embracing the tract of country
                    stretching northwards from the Drave and Mur, with the Little Hungarian Plain,
                    and the region of the Upper Alföld, extending from Budapest to Nyiregyhâza and
                    Sârospatak; and the “great lowland” zone, including the main portion of the
                    Great Hungarian Plain, and the region of the lower Danube, where the heat during
                    the summer months is almost tropical. In Transylvania the climate bears the
                    extreme characteristics peculiar to mountainous countries interspersed with
                    valleys; whilst that of the south-western Croatian and Frontier districts
                    bordering on the Adriatic is modified by the neighbourhood of the sea. The
                    minimum of the temperature is attained in January and the maximum in July. At
                    Buda, which, if we exclude Transylvania, is near the centre of the kingdom, the
                    mean average temperature (1862-77) in January i⅛ 31" 0' and in July 71° 7'; at
                    Kolozsvâr (Klausenburg) in the same months it is 32° 7' and 68" 9' respectively.
                    The rainfall in Hungary is small in comparison with that of Austria. At Buda,

                    the two Hungarian plains generally the rainy days are estimated not to exceed 96
                    annually. In the vicinity of the Carpathians, however, rain is very prevalent,
                    amounting to between 30 and 40 inches. In these regions the greatest fall is
                    during the summer, though in some years the autumn showers are heavier. Hail
                    storms are of frequent occurrence in the Carpathians. On the plains rain rarely
                    falls during the heats of summer; and, generally speaking, the showers though
                    violent are of but short duration, whilst the moisture is quickly evaporated
                    owing to the aridity of the atmosphere. The vast sandy wastes mainly contribute
                    to the dryness of the winds on the Great Hungarian Alföld. Occasionally, as in
                    the year 1863, the whole country suffers much from drought; but, on the other
                    hand, disastrous floods not unfrequently occur, particularly in the spring, when
                    the beds of the rivers and streams are inadequate to contain the increased
                    volume of water caused by the rapid melting of the snows on the Carpathians. The
                    low-lying arable and pasture lands in the vicinity of the Theiss and Maros are
                    thus sometimes submerged for weeks, and in March 1879 the town of Szeged,
                    situated at the point of junction of these two rivers, was almost completely
                    destroyed. In December of the same year the counties of Arad and Bihar were
                    extensively inundated by the Maros and the Körös. In 1838 the city of Pest, and
                    in February 1876 several localities on the Danube, suffered disastrously from
                    the sudden rising of that river. The average annual number of snow showers is
                    estimated at 23 for the two Hungarian plains, 44 for Transylvania, 50 for the
                    northern, and 30 to 35 for the western and south-western portions of the
                    monarchy. In 1866—67, and again in 1872—73, cholera was very rife; of the
                    447,571 persons who were attacked by the epidemic in the latter case, 189,017,
                    or over 42 per cent., died. Nevertheless Hungary cannot, on the whole, be
                    regarded as an unhealthy country, excepting in the marshy tracts, where
                    intermittent fever and diphtheria sometimes exhibit great virulence.</p>
                <p>The whole of Hungary, but more especially Hungary Proper, can boast of the great
                    variety and number of its natural productions. This is attributable partly to
                    its geographical position, but chiefly to the varied nature of its surface and
                    climate. The fertility of the soil, if we except the mountainous and sandy
                    regions, is remarkable. The vegetable products include almost every description
                    of grain, especially wheat and maize, besides Turkish pepper, rapeseed, hemp and
                    flax, beans, potatoes, and root crops. Fruits of various descriptions, and more
                    particularly melons and stone fruits, are abundant. In the southern districts
                    almonds, figs, rice, and olives are grown. Amongst the forest and other trees
                    are the oak, which yields large quantities of galls, the beech, fir, pine, ash,
                    and alder, also the chestnut, walnut, and filbert. The vine is cultivated over
                    the greater part of Hungary, the chief grape-growing districts being those of
                    the Hegyalja (Tokay), Sopron, and Ruszt, Mènes, Szerémség, Szekszârd, Somlyô
                    (Schomlau), Béllye and Villâny,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Next to France, Hungary is the greatest wine-producing country in Europe, and
                    the quality of some of the vintages, especially that of Tokay, is unsurpassed. A
                    great quantity of tobacco is also grown, but it is wholly monopolized by the
                    crown. In Hungary Proper and in Croatia and Slavonia there are many species of
                    indigenous plants, which are unrepresented in Transylvania. Besides 12 species
                    peculiar to the former grand-principality, 14 occur only there and in
                    Siberia.</p>
                <p>The fauna of Hungary includes about 14,000 species. The horned cattle are amongst
                    the finest in Europe, and large herds of swine are reared in the oak forests. In
                    1870 the total number of cattle (including 73,243 buffaloes) was estimated at
                    5,279,193, and of swine at 4,443,279. Of sheep, the breed of which is now
                    greatly improved, the number amounted to 15,076,997; of horses there were
                    2,158,819, asses 30,480, mules 3,266, and goats 572,95L The wild animals are
                    bears, wolves, foxes, lynxes, wild cats, badgers, otters, martens, stoats, and
                    weasels. Among the rodents there are hares, marmots, beavers, squirrels, rats,
                    and mice,—the last in enormous swarms. Of the larger game the chamois and deer
                    are specially noticeable. Among the birds are the vulture, eagle, falcon,
                    buzzard, kite, lark, nightingale, heron, stork, and bustard. Domestic and wild
                    fowl are generally abundant. The rivers and lakes yield enormous quantities of
                    fish, and leeches also are plentiful. The Theiss, once better supplied with fish
                    than any other river in Europe, has for many years fallen off in its
                    productiveness. The culture of the silkworm is chiefly carried on in the
                    south—in the Military Frontier, and in Croatia and Slavonia. The principal
                    beerearing localities are in the counties of Gömör, Szepes, and Mosony, the
                    Military Frontier, and the former Saxon districts of Transylvania. In 1870 the
                    number of bee-hives was estimated at 617,407.</p>
                <p>The chief mineral products are coal, nitre, sulphur, alum, soda, saltpetre,
                    gypsum, porcelain-earth, pipe-clay, asphalt, petroleum, marble, and ores of
                    gold, silver, mercury, copper, iron, lead, zinc, antimony, cobalt, and arsenic.
                    The opals of Saros are famous, and precious stones of various descriptions
                    (calcedony, garnet, jacinth, amethyst, carnelian, agate, rock-crystals, &amp;c.
                    ) are met with in several localities. Amber occurs at Magura in Szepes county.
                    Gold and silver are found chiefly in , the districts of Selmecz (Schemnitz),
                    Körmöcz (Kremnitz), Nagybânya, Szomolnok, Oravicza, Abrudbänya, and Zalatna. The
                    average yearly yield of gold is equal in value to about £219,000, and that of
                    silver to some £178,600. The sand of some of the rivers, as for instance the
                    Maros, Szamos, Körös, and Aranyos, is auriferous. Iron is extensively produced
                    in the counties of Gömör, Zôlyom, Liptô, Szepes, Saros, Borsod, Torna, Abaùj,
                    Szatmâr, Bihar, and Krassô; coal in the neighbourhood of Pécsvârad, Oravicza,

                    Piszke and the neighbouring Almas in the counties of Esztergom and Komarom, as
                    also at various places in the counties of Baranya, Veszprém, Abaιij, Szepes, and
                    Lipto. The largest salt-mines are at Rénaszék, Sugatag, and Szlatina in the
                    county of Mâramaros, in Hungary Proper, and at Vizakna, Parajd, Torda, Deésakna,
                    and Maros-ujvar in Transylvania. In 1877 the value of the salt produced was
                    12,369,599 florins, of other minerals 18,787,757 florins. The yearly worth of
                    the whole mining produce of the Hungarian realm is estimated at over £3,000,000,
                    of which, however, the amount attributable to Croatia and Slavonia is
                    comparatively small. There are several hundred cold and 64 warm mineral springs
                    in Hungary Proper and in Croatia and Slavonia, whilst a relatively greater
                    number are met with in Transylvania. Of warm springs the most famous are those
                    of Buda, Mehâdia, Eger (Erlau), Nagyvarad (Grosswardein), Sztubnya, Szliâcs,
                    Harkany, Pôstény, Krapina, and Teplitz. Among the cold mineral springs the more
                    worthy of note are those of Suliguly, Borszék, Bartfa, Czigelka, Szulin, Farad,

                <p>Since the year 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands
                    belonging to the Hungarian crown have been in great measure remodelled. In 1868
                    Transylvania was definitively reunited to Hungary Proper, and the town and
                    district of Fiume declared autonomous. In 1873 the Servian-Bânât or Eastern
                    Military Frontier was incorporated with Hungary Proper. In 1876 the whole
                    administrative subdivision of Hungary into counties, districts, and sees was
                    revised, and for the sake of uniformity one general system of counties was
                    introduced, except for the Croatian-Slavonian Military Frontier, which is
                    divided into border districts. The total number of subdivisions amounts to 80,
                    of which 65 appertain to Hungary Proper and Transylvania, 1 to Fiume and
                    district, 8 to Croatia and Slavonia, and 6 to the Croatian-Slavonian Military
                    Frontier. Hungary Proper, according to ancient usage, is generally divided into
                    four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania has since 1876 been regarded
                    as the fifth. Neither numerically nor according to territorial extent are the
                    present 65 counties distributed equally among their respective circles, which
                    must be regarded as geographical rather than political divisions, for they are
                    not recognized in the judicial, fiscal, military, postal, and administrative
                    relations of the country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The four circles of Hungary Proper had formerly their special political
                    significance, owing to the so-called “circular sittings,” where the deputies of
                    each of the four circles met for the preliminary discussion of parliamentary
                    questions.</p></note> The circles are—</p>

                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>As regards nationality the Magyar or pure Hungarian race is the most numerously
                    represented in the kingdom, amounting, according to Dr Konek (see Schwicker, <hi
                    rend="italic">Statistik des Königreiches Ungarn,</hi> 1877), to 6,176,612, or 40
                    per cent, of the whole civil population. The Magyar element is chiefly confined
                    to Hungary Proper and Transylvania, only about 15,000 Magyars residing in
                    Croatia and Slavonia. The German population amounts to 1,898,202 (12 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3per cent.), for the most part settled in the western
                    and north-western counties of Hungary Proper, bordering on Austria, also in the
                    county of Szepes in the north, in the former Bânât, and in the Saxon counties of
                    Transylvania. The Roumanians, estimated at 2,608,120 (16’9 per cent.), are
                    mostly resident in Transylvania and the counties immediately abutting on it. The
                    Slovaks amount to 1,835,334 (ll <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 per cent.), and
                    the Ruthens to 469,420 (3 per cent.), the former chiefly located in the north
                    and north-west and the latter in the north-east of Hungary Proper. The aggregate
                    number of Croats and Serbs is 2,380,985 (15 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per
                    cent.), chiefly confined to Croatia and Slavonia and the Military Frontier,
                    where they form 97 per cent, of the population, to the former Servian-Bânât, and
                    the southern counties of Hungary Proper. The other nationalities, comprising
                    Armenians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Macedo-Wallachians, Albanians, French, and
                    Italians, are not largely represented, their total number being estimated at
                    only 48,654 (about 0 ’ 3 per cent. ); the Italians are, however, to be met with
                    in considerable numbers at Fiume and in its vicinity. In the above statistics
                    the Jews scattered over the country, and amounting altogether to rather more
                    than half a million, have been reckoned with the various nationalities where

                    Hungary Proper. On the whole the Magyar element may be said to predominate in 27

                <p>The Roman Catholics are in overwhelming majority in 32 counties, the adherents of
                    the Greek (Eastern) Church in 11, the Greek Catholics in 10, ' and the Lutherans
                    in 5. Further the Greek Orientalists have a majority in 6 counties, the
                    Calvinists in 5, the Roman Catholics in 4, the Lutherans in 2, and the Greek
                    Catholics in</p>
                <p>1 county. The Roman Catholic Church has 4 archbishops: Esztergom (Gran), Kalocsa,
                    Eger (Erlau), and Zagrab (Agram), and 17 real diocesan bishops; to the latter
                    must be added, moreover, the chief abbot of Pannonhalma, who likewise enjoys
                    episcopal rights. The primate is the archbishop of Esztergom, who also bears the
                    title of prince, and whose special privilege it is to crown the sovereigns of
                    Hungary. The Greek Catholic Church, which is in connexion with the Romish
                    communion, owns besides the archbishop of Esztergom the archbishop of
                    Gyulafehérvâr (Carlsburg), or rather Balasfalva <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    “Blasiusville ”), and 6 bishops. The Armenian Catholic Church is partly under
                    the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic bishop of Transylvania, and partly under
                    that of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Kalocsa. The Greek (Eastern) Church in
                    Hungary is subject to the authority of the metropolitan of Carlowitz and the
                    archbishop of Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt); under the former are the bishops of
                    Bacs, Buda, Temesvâr, Versecz, and Pakrâcz, and under the latter the bishops of
                    Arad and Karânsebes. The two great Protestant communities are divided into
                    ecclesiastical districts, five for each; the heads of these districts bear the
                    title of superintendents. The Unitarians, chiefly resident in Transylvania, are
                    under the authority of a bishop, whose see is Klausenburg. The Jewish
                    communities are comprised in ecclesiastical districts, the head direction being
                    at Budapest. At the commencement of 1870 there were 19,858 clerics of various
                    creeds in Hungary.</p>
                <p>Since the year 1867 great improvements have been effected in the educational
                    system of Hungary, especially in Hungary Proper and Transylvania. Before that
                    year public instruction was in the hands of the ecclesiastics of the various
                    confessions, and the public schools had in consequence more or less of a
                    denominational character. One of the first cares of the new responsible ministry
                    of</p>
                <p>1867 was to provide for the education of all children not attending the then
                    existing scholastic establishments, by the introduction of supplementary
                    non-denominational schools. By a law passed in</p>
                <p>1868 the Government made it compulsory on children of both sexes between the ages
                    of 6 and 12 to attend school, and it moreover required that children from 12 to
                    15 should attend the “repetition schools.” The educational system of Croatia and
                    Slavonia is autonomous, being under the independent direction of the
                    Croatian-Slavonian provincial government.</p>
                <p>The various educational establishments may be divided into four classes :—common,
                    middle, high, and special schools. In 1877 Hungary Proper and Transylvania had
                    15,486 belonging to the first-mentioned class; of these 13,755 were private or
                    denominational, and 1731 communal and state schools. These figures show a total
                    increase of 2341 since the year 1865, when the number was only 13,145. It is
                    estimated that at the end of 1877 there was one school for every 870
                    inhabitants. In that year the number of children between the ages of six and
                    fifteen who came under the education act amounted to 2,127,950, and of these
                    1,559,636 or 73 per cent, attended; whereas in 1869 the percentage of day
                    scholars barely reached 48, showing an increase of 25 per cent, in the course of
                    eight years. In 1874 there was already an attendance of 1,497,144, or nearly 70
                    per cent. The number of children who attended school in Croatia and Slavonia,
                    with the Military Frontier, at that date was 73,635, making a general total for
                    the whole of Hungary for the year 1874 of 1,570,779. On account of the variety
                    of languages and races prevailing in many parts of Hungary, the education in
                    numerous schools has to be conducted in two,, and in several instances even in

                <p>The middle schools consist of the gymnasia, real-schools, and similar

                    was 24, with 129 masters and 1114 pupils.</p>
                <p>The high schools comprise the universities of Budapest, Kolozsvâr (Klausenburg),
                    and Zâgrâb (Agram), the Joseph-Polytechnic, the theological institutes, the law
                    academies, &amp;c. The Budapest university (founded at Tyrnau in 1635) has four
                    faculties,—theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and philosophy. In the year 1877
                    the number of professors amounted to 166, and that of students to 2929 (in 1878
                    to 180 and 3117 respectively). The university of Kolozsvâr was founded in 1872,
                    and is similar in its organization to that of Budapest, excepting that it has a
                    faculty for mathematics and natural science, but none for theology. The number
                    of professors in 1877 was 64, and that of students 391. Zâgrâb university was
                    founded in 1869, but was not in active operation till 1874, and was even then
                    incomplete in its formation. It has three faculties,— jurisprudence, theology,
                    and philosophy. The Joseph-Polytechnic, ranking as a high school at Budapest
                    since 1871, had in 1877 as many as 56 professors with 800 students. The number
                    of theological institutions in Hungary Proper and Transylvania at that date was
                    45,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To the above must be
                    now added the “Rabbinerschule," opened October 4, 1877, and numbering (in
                    1878-79) 31 pupils.</p></note> with 284 professors and 1534 novices; 25 of these
                    institutions were Roman Catholic, 4 Greek Catholic, 3 Greek Eastern Church, 7
                    Lutheran, 5 Calvinistic, and 1 Unitarian. There were, moreover, 12 law
                    academies, with 115 professors and 1067 students. In 1878 there were 125
                    professors and 1043 pupils. In Croatia and Slavonia there were 5 theological
                    institutes (4 Roman Catholic and 1 Greek Eastern Church), with about 30
                    professors and some 200 students. The special schools are for particular
                    branches of science and art. Among these are the school of design at Budapest;
                    the music academy (founded 1875); several establishments for teaching mining, at
                    Selmecz (Schemnitz), Nagyâg, Felsö-Bänya; farming and agriculture, at
                    Magyar-Ovâr (Altenburg), Keszthely, Kolozsvâr, Debreczen; and the management of
                    forests, at Selmecz; also institutes for the blind, deaf, and dumb, and for
                    lunatics at Vâcz (Waitzen), Budapest, and Pozsony; and schools for veterinary
                    surgery, obstetrics, &amp;c. There are, moreover, military seminaries at
                    Budapest, Kassa (Kaschau), Dé va, Köszeg (Güns), Fehértemplom, and Zâgrâb, and a
                    naval school at Fiume.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian academy of sciences is the supreme representative of the national
                    culture. First constituted with royal sanction in 1830, the academy in 1879
                    consisted of 321 (224 home and 97 foreign) members, arranged in 3 classes. Next
                    follow the Kisfaludy (comprising in 1879 only 50 home and 15 foreign members)
                    and Petöli societies of Budapest, the royal meteorological institute, and the
                    medical and physical (natural science), historical, archaeological, geological,
                    geographical (founded 1872), and philological (1875) societies. To these must be
                    added the Roman Catholic ‘ ’ St Stephen’s union,” the “Protestant union,” the
                    Zâgrâb “South Slavonian Academy” (founded 1861), and the various Transylvanian
                    and provincial learned societies.</p>
                <p>As the industrial products and commerce of Hungary have been already described in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Austria</hi> (vol. iii. p. 119-121), we need
                    only add here a few remarks as to the chief localities of certain trades and
                    manufactures.</p>
                <p>The principal machine factories, foundries, bell and type works, and works for
                    iron and other metallic wares are at Pest, Buda, Temesvâr, Resicza, Diosgyör,
                    and Sopron (Oedenburg). Boat-building is carried on at the chief towns on the
                    great rivers, especially at Szeged, Arad, Buda, Komârom (Komorn), and Györ
                    (Raab); steam-vessels are constructed at Buda and Fiume. The glass manufacture,
                    mostly carried on in the hilly districts, is not yet fully developed, and th,e
                    articles are of an inferior quality.. The best manufactories of stoneware and
                    earthenware are those of Csàkvâr, Pécs (Fünfkirchen), Rimaszombat, Murâny, Papa,
                    Köszeg (Güns), Iglo, Körmöczbänya, Zâgrâb, and Kra-Çina; of porcelain the most
                    important is that of Herend. Debreczen, âpa, Selmeczbanya, and Szigetvâr are
                    famed for their clay pipes. The preparation of chemical stuffs is carried on
                    chiefly at Pest, Nagyszombat (Tyrnau), Pozsony (Pressburg), Nagyszeben ( Hermann
                    - stadt), and Ujmoldova; whilst Debreczen and Szeged are noted for their soap
                    and candles. Oil factories are numerous, especially in Hungary Proper and
                    Transylvania; the chief oil mills and refining houses are at Pest, New Pest,
                    Râkospalota, Székesfehérvâr (Stuhlweissenburg), Györ, Pozsony, Kassa (Kaschau),
                    Temesvâr, Brassô, (Kronstadt), and Cservenka, which last has forty mills. The
                    manufacture of silk stuffs is still undeveloped, but there are spinneries at
                    Nagyczenk, Hidja, Sopron, and Féltorony, also in the Banât, and in various parts
                    of Transylvania and of the Frontier districts. Flax is mostly homespun, and
                    confined to the commoner kinds of linen. There are factories for woollen yarn at
                    Brassô, Nagyszeben, and Gurano, and for woollen stuffs at Losoncz and Szakolcza.
                    Coarse cloth is made in many parts of the kingdom. Leather is prepared at Kassa,
                    Pozsony, Rozsnyö (Rosenau), Könnend, Temesvâr, Kés-mârk, and Budapest. Paper is
                    made at Diosgyör, Nezsider (Neusiedl), Hermanecz, Szlabos, and Fiume. Breweries
                    are chiefly to be found in the neighbourhood of the large towns, which contain a
                    mixed population, as the Magyars are drinkers of wine and spirits rather than of
                    beer; the breweries of Köbänya near Pest are the most extensive. The taste for
                    beer is said to be increasing, although the total number of breweries in Hungary
                    has since 1860 been steadily falling, and many of the smaller establishments no
                    longer exist, or have been absorbed. A considerable quantity of beer is,
                    moreover, imported from Bohemia and the neighbourhood of Vienna. The largest
                    sugar-works are those of Surâny, Moson (Wieselburg), Szent-Miklôs, and Edelény.
                    The most important tobacco factories are those of Pest, Kassa, Debreczen, and
                    Fiume.</p>
                <p>As regards the number of factories exact data are not forthcoming. It appears,
                    however, that in 1874 there were in the whole kingdom altogether 82,570 spirit
                    distilleries, of which 991 were substantial factories and 81,579 rural stills.
                    The breweries in activity at that date amounted to 247, of which 211 were in the
                    mother country, and 36 in Croatia and Slavonia. There were, besides, 20 sugar
                    refineries, and about 30,000 flour-mills of various descriptions, of which
                    nearly 25,000 were in Hungary Proper and Transylvania. In fact the - preparation
                    of flour, which is, moreover, largely exported to Germany and Switzerland, is
                    one of the most important industries of Hungary.</p>
                <p>According to a report of Μ. de Hieronimy, under secretary of state in the
                    Hungarian ministry of public works, the length of Hungarian railways in
                    operation in the year 1867 was only 1375 English miles. The length of railways
                    constructed from that date to the year 1876 amounted to 2675 miles, and thus at
                    the beginning of 1877 there were 4050 miles of railway in operation in Hungary.
                    By the early part of 1879 the total length was about 7000 kilometres or 4400
                    miles. There are also some 18,000 miles of highways (good and bad), and more
                    than 2500 miles of navigable river and canal communication. The imports
                    (including those from Austria) may beroughly estimated at £45,000,000, and the
                    exports at £35,000,000. There is also a considerable transit trade carried on
                    between Austria and the western states and the regions of the lower Danube,
                    estimated at £8,500,000 yearly. The number of freighted vessels that arrived at
                    the ports of the Hungarian Littorale in 1876 was 3524, the number that left
                    3362; of the former 909, and of the latter 926 were steamers.</p>
                <p>Besides the several branches of the “Austrian-Hungarian Bank” at Budapest, Kassa
                    (Kaschau), Debreczen, and Temesvâr, Hungary possesses about 120 industrial,
                    commercial, and credit banks. There are, moreover, 12 chambers of commerce and
                    industry at Budapest, Pozsony (Pressburg), Kassa, Sopron (Oedenburg), Debreczen,
                    Temesvâr, Arad, Kolozsvâr (Klausenburg), Brassô (Kronstadt), Fiume, Zâgrâb
                    (Agram), and Eszék. The number of savings banks is about 310; of other
                    associations, such as loan societies, popular, mutual, and alliance banks,
                    &amp;c., the aggregate is over 200. In the year 1876 the number of post-office
                    orders issued amounted to 1,832,757. The total number of telegraphic messages
                    sent, received, or transmitted was 6,462,335. The aggregate of postal missives
                    was 112,851,516; of these 46,617,106 were prepaid and 1,452,233 not prepaid
                    letters; 4,581,027 were registered, and 13,954,354 official letters; 9,016,232
                    were post-cards; 28,876,062 were articles per newspaper, 1,364,490 per pattern,
                    and 6,990,012 per book post.</p>
                <p>The form of government in Hungary is that of a constitutional monarchy. The
                    sovereign power is at present vested in the house of Hapsburg-Lorraine, whose
                    descendants succeed by right of primogeniture in the male line. By virtue of the
                    Pragmatic Sanction, females may also reign in the event of there being no male
                    successor. The king is the guardian of the laws, and the head of the army and of
                    the executive. His power is limited by parliament, which consists of an upper
                    and a lower house, and must be summoned yearly and elected triennially. The
                    upper house comprises 407 members, viz., 3 princes of the reigning house, 31
                    Roman and Greek Catholic prelates, 11 standard-bearers, 57 lord-lieutenants of
                    counties, 3 dukes, 219 counts, 81 barons, and 2 deputies for Croatia and
                    Slavonia. The lower house, elected by the eligible tax-payers, consists of 446
                    members, of whom 403 represent Hungary Proper and Transylvania (including also
                    Fiume), and 43 Croatia and Slavonia and the Military Frontier. The language used
                    in the house is the Magyar, but the representatives of Croatia and Slavonia may
                    use their native language. The executive is vested in a president of the cabinet
                    and the following ministries :—court; finance; interior; religion and education;
                    justice; public works; agriculture, industry, and commerce; <hi rend="italic"
                    >honvéd</hi> (home-defence); and a ministry for Croatia and Slavonia. For
                    matters relating to its special provincial administration, Croatia and Slavonia
                    has at Zâgrâb (Agram) its own government, at the head of which is the ban, who
                    is nominated by the king. The departments are three,—interior and finance,
                    religion and education, and justice. (For the relations of the kingdom of
                    Hungary to the joint Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, and for the delegations,

                <p>The judicial power is independent of the administrative, the functions of the
                    minister of justice being to see that the laws are properly applied. The supreme
                    courts of justice, as also those of second instance for Hungary Proper and
                    Transylvania and Fiume, are at Budapest. There is also a secondary court of
                    appeal at Maros-Vâsarhely<pb break="no"

                    justice in the mother country (including also Fiume) in 1877 was 66, and there
                    were 375 circuit courts. Of the 23,033 criminals condemned in 1877, 13,237 or
                    57'47 per cent, were completely illiterate, 1193 or 5'18 per cent, were able to
                    read, 8314 or 36'10 per cent, could both read and write, and 289 or 1 '25 per
                    cent, were persons of superior education. As to the punishments awarded, 34
                    persons were condemned to death (of whom only 3 were executed), 13 were
                    sentenced to prison with hard labour for life, 124 to from 10 to 20 years’
                    imprisonment, 272 to from 5 to 10 years, 3537 to from 1 to 5 years, and 19,053
                    to less than a year’s imprisonment.</p>
                <p>As regards the financial position of the kingdom, owing to the vast sums spent on
                    state railways, the Fiume harbour works, and other large undertakings, the
                    annual deficit rapidly increased until 1874, but from that date until 1878 it
                    fell from about 33 to 21 million florins, the budget for the latter year giving
                    a revenue of 219,846,016 and an expenditure of 240,967,435 florins.</p>

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi></p>
                <p>The south-western portion of Hungary, as formed by the Danube, belonged to the
                    Roman province of Pannonia; the south-eastern portion, as formed by the Theiss
                    (Ptol. iii. 8, § 4), to that of Dacia; the tract of country lying between these
                    two rivers was inhabited by the Jazyges. As early as 274 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> Dacia was abandoned by the Romans to the Goths. In 376 the Huns
                    crossed the Don, and, having overrun the intervening country, about 380
                    established themselves in Pannonia, where under Attila their power was so vastly
                    extended that in 432 the authority of the Romans entirely ceased. After the
                    death of Attila (453) the greater part of the country fell into the hands of the
                    Ostrogoths and Gepidae. These yielded in their turn to the Longobardi, who in
                    526-548 gained possession of the whole of Pannonia. When the latter removed to
                    Italy in 568, the Avars entered, but they were reduced to subjection by
                    Charlemagne in 791-796.</p>
                <p>The history of Hungary really begins with the appearance of the Magyars in Europe
                    about the year 884. It is generally admitted that they were a branch of the
                    Turanian stock, and descendants of the ancient Scythians; certain affinities of
                    language show them to be related to the Lapps, Esths, and Finns. They are
                    believed to have wandered from the’Ural mountains to the region of the middle
                    Volga, and thence to have migrated westward over the Dnieper and the Bug. At the
                    time of their crossing the Carpathians about 889, under the lead of Almos, they
                    were divided into seven tribes, united by a compact which guaranteed justice and
                    equality among their members. At the death of Almos in 889, the chiefs of the
                    tribes elected his son Arpâd successor. His followers overran the whole of
                    Hungary and Transylvania, extending their conquests beyond the ancient province
                    of Pannonia. From the time of the conquest to the year 1000, Hungary was ruled
                    by dukes, the regal title being first assumed by Vaik (Stephen). The following
                    table gives the dates of accession of the Arpâd dynasty, which ruled over
                    Hungary for upwards of four centuries :—</p>

                <p>Under Zoltân and Taksony the Hungarians made various expeditions beyond the
                    limits of their own country, spreading terror and devastation through Europe.
                    They were ultimately checked, however, by the emperor Henry I., near Merseburg,
                    in 933, and afterwards by Otho the Great at the Lech (955). These defeats caused
                    the Hungarians to turn their attention to the consolidation of their power
                    within their own territory. Geyza, who succeeded Taksony in 972, married a
                    Christian princess, and also furthered the introduction of Christianity by
                    entrusting the education of his son Vaik to Adalbert, bishop of Prague. On
                    succeeding his father, Vaik applied for and received the title of “apostolic
                    king” from the hands of Pope Sylvester II., and was crowned in the year 1000
                    under the name of Stephen. This monarch, known as “St Stephen of Hungary,” laid
                    the foundation of many existing institutions. He subdivided the land into
                    counties, and provided it with an ecclesiastical organization, establishing
                    bishoprics, and founding churches, chapels, convents, and schools. Having
                    elevated the bishops to the highest posts of trust and power in the state, he
                    forced the people to pay tithes to the clergy. He also created a national
                    council, consisting of the lords temporal and spiritual, and of the knights or
                    lower nobility, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n381/mode/1up"

                    originated. Stephen dying in 1038, and leaving no heir, the queen Gisela
                    contrived to gain the throne for her nephew Peter, but a portion of the nobles
                    declared for Aba, who was of Arpadian blood. In the wars which ensued both
                    princes perished, when Andrew I., who was nearly related to Stephen I.,
                    succeeded to the throne in 1047, but he was ultimately forced to yield it to his
                    brother Béla I. The next monarch’s reign that offers anything worthy of notice
                    is that of Ladislaus I., whose religious zeal gained him the appellation of
                    “Saint,” and who was distinguished on account of his conquest of Croatia (1089)
                    and part of Galicia (1093), and for his victories over the Cumans (1086-89), the
                    invaders of Transylvania and the neighbouring districts. His nephew Coloman, a
                    brave and talented monarch, guarded the country against the depredations of the
                    hosts of crusaders who passed through it during his reign. He also wrested
                    Dalmatia from the Venetians (1102), and annexed it to the Hungarian kingdom.
                    Coloman died in 1114, leaving the throne to his youthful son Stephen II., who
                    soon entangled himself in warfare with neighbouring princes. The reign of his
                    successor Béla II. (1131-41), like that of the other kings of the 12th century,
                    presents few features of interest. That of Andrew II. (1205-35) is celebrated on
                    account of the “Golden Bull,” or Hungarian Magna Charta, extorted from the king
                    by the nobles in the year 1222, after his return from a crusade forced upon him
                    by the pope. The Golden Bull guaranteed that the states should be convoked
                    annually, that no noble was to be arrested without being first tried and legally
                    condemned, that the property of the nobility should be exempt from dues, that
                    foreign service was to be rewarded, that appointments to the highest offices
                    should be under the control of the diet. It also contained numerous other
                    clauses granting certain freedoms, privileges, and exemptions to the nobility
                    and the clergy, and included a proviso of the right of armed resistance to
                    tyrannical measures on the part of the crown. This charter was duly sworn to by
                    subsequent kings of Hungary, but the article relating to the right of appeal to
                    arms was abrogated in 1687. A few years after the accession of Béla IV., son of
                    Andrew II., the Mongols invaded and devastated the whole country, massacring
                    great numbers of the population (1241-42). Béla did all in his power, by the
                    introduction of German colonists, to retrieve the disasters inflicted by the
                    invasion; but his wars with Austria and Styria, and the revolts of his son
                    Stephen, were prejudicial to the restoration of order. He, however, successfully
                    repelled a second Mongol invasion in 1261. The reigns of the next two monarchs,
                    Stephen V. (1270-72) and Ladislaus IV. (1272-90), are noticeable chiefly for the
                    wars on behalf of Rudolf of Austria against Ottokar of Bohemia. Ladislaus is
                    said to have been murdered in 1290 amidst violent commotions caused by his
                    Cumanian amours. His successor Andrew III., the last king of the Àrpâd dynasty,
                    after a short but disturbed reign, died in 1301, leaving no issue.</p>
                <p>On the death of Andrew III. the royal dignity became an object of competition.
                    One party elected Wenceslaus, son of the king of Bohemia and Poland (1301-5),
                    and after him Otho of Bavaria (1305-8), both connected with the Arpadian house.
                    Pope Boniface VIII. and the bishops successfully espoused the cause of Charles
                    Robert of Anjou, nephew of the king of Naples, and related to the extinct
                    dynasty through his mother, a daughter of Stephen V. Under Charles and his son
                    Louis, which latter in 1370 succeeded Casimir III. on the throne of Poland,
                    Hungary made great progress both at home and abroad. During the reign of Louis
                    it became the most formidable state in Europe. Among many other territories he
                    conquered Moldavia (1352) and Bulgaria (1365); he also greatly extended and
                    developed the royal prerogatives in his own kingdom. Upon the death of Louis
                    (1382), the states raised to the throne his daughter Maria, who, after the
                    assassination of the pretender Charles II. (1386), reigned conjointly with her
                    consort Sigismond of Brandenburg, son of the emperor Charles IV. In the early
                    part of this reign the Turks under the sultan Bajazet infested some of the
                    Hungarian provinces, and at length in 1396 utterly defeated Sigismond at
                    Nicopolis, obliging him to fly the kingdom. During his absence a party headed by
                    the palatine Gara raised the standard of rebellion, and upon his return deprived
                    him of his liberty. Scarcely was he released when he met with a rival in
                    Uladislaus, king of Poland, who had married Hedwig, second daughter of Louis.
                    Elected emperor (1411), and afterwards king of Bohemia (1419), Sigismond,
                    instead of providing for the safety of the country, employed his time in
                    persecuting the Hussites. He ended his long and troublous reign 9th December
                    1437, and was succeeded by his son-in-law Albert, archduke of Austria.</p>
                <p>The year 1439 witnessed the sudden death of Albert; his widow, however, was soon
                    delivered of a son, Ladislaus Posthumus. The states invited Uladislaus of Poland
                    to the throne, and thus considerable dissensions existed until the death of the
                    queen in 1442, when the party of Uladislaus secured his accession. At the
                    commencement of his reign the Turks were several times defeated by John Hunyady
                    (Corvinus), and they were at length forced to conclude a truce for ten years.
                    The Hungarians, having almost immediately broken faith with the Turks, and taken
                    the field against them, were completely routed at Varna on the 10th November
                    1444. In this battle Uladislaus met his end, whilst Hunyady escaped with a few
                    followers. Amid the troubles which ensued the states proclaimed Hunyady
                    “governor of Hungary” pending the absence of Ladislaus Posthumus, whom the
                    emperor Frederick III. refused to deliver to the Hungarians to be acknowledged
                    king. After the release and recognition<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He took the oath in 1453, but Frederick withheld the
                    crown.</p></note> of Ladislaus in 1452, Hunyady resigned the office of governor,
                    and was nominated generalissimo by the king.</p>
                <p>After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Mohammed II. made preparations for the
                    conquest of Hungary, and in 1456 appeared before Belgrade with an army of
                    150,000 men. This force was, however, utterly routed on July 21, 1456, by the
                    combined Hungarian, Italian, and Spanish troops, in all about 70,000 men, under
                    the command of John Hunyady and the monk John Capistran. Soon after this
                    victory, which resulted in the Turks raising the siege, Hunyady succumbed to
                    dysentery aggravated by excessive fatigue, leaving behind him two sons,
                    Ladislaus and Matthias. The former was executed by order of Ladislaus Posthumus,
                    while the latter, after that monarch’s death in November 1457, being supported
                    by a strong party under the leadership of his uncle Michael Szilâgyi, was
                    elevated to the royal dignity on the 24th January 1458, under the title of
                    Matthias I. The emperor Frederick, having disputed his right to the throne, and
                    assumed the regal title himself, was forced by Matthias to surrender all claims
                    to the Hungarian dominions, and to conclude a peace in July 1463. During the
                    next few years Matthias was employed in reorganizing the military system and
                    repelling the Turks. He after this turned his arms against Podiebrad, king of
                    Bohemia (1468), ostensibly for the purpose of defending the Catholics against
                    the Hussites. Being victorious in these campaigns, Matthias in May 1469 caused
                    himself to be proclaimed king of Bohemia and Moravia at Olmiitz. Meanwhile the
                    Turks, taking advantage<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0382-0369"/> of the absence of the king, made incursions into
                    the southern provinces of Hungary. This misfortune created a party against
                    Matthias, who, having returned to Hungary and restored order, marched against
                    the Ottoman forces, and totally defeated them in a sanguinary battle on the
                    plains of Kenyérmezô in Transylvania (13th November 1479). After the death of
                    Mohammed II. in 1481, Matthias renewed hostilities with the emperor Frederick,
                    and having taken Vienna (1485), made it the seat of his government. Matthias was
                    not only an able and warlike monarch, but a patron of letters,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The world-famed Bibliotheca
                    Corvina is variously estimated to have contained from 5000 to 10,000 volumes,
                    chiefly manuscripts, many of which were bought from Greek scholars who had fled
                    from Constantinople, or had been copied in different part s of Italy.</p></note>
                    and administered his kingdom with impartiality, subduing the rebellious nobles,
                    and restoring order, law, and prosperity.</p>
                <p>At the death of Matthias, 6th April 1490, there were several pretenders to the
                    throne, among them John Corvinus, a natural son of the late king, the emperor
                    Frederick, and his son Maximilian. But the states disallowed their claims, and
                    declared for Uladislaus of Bohemia, whose weak reign is marked chiefly by the
                    insurrection of the peasantry in Transylvania, under D&lt;5zsa, which was
                    suppressed with great bloodshed in 1514, as also for the collection made by
                    Verböczy of the common laws of the realm, entitled “Tripartitum Opus Juris
                    Consuetudinarii Inclyti Regni Hungariae,” which code was sanctioned by the king
                    and the diet in 1514. Under this monarch and his son Louis II., who succeeded
                    him, the power of Hungary rapidly declined, and it was at length utterly
                    overthrown by the Turks under Soliman the Magnificent. This powerful ruler,
                    having captured Belgrade and Peterwardein, advanced at the head of 200,000 men
                    into the interior of the country, and annihilated the Hungarian army at the
                    battle of Mohâcs, 29th August 1526. In the carnage several prelates and the
                    flower of the Hungarian nobility were destroyed, and Louis himself perished in
                    his flight. The Ottomans, after pillaging Buda and spreading devastation over
                    the whole country, took their departure with many thousands of captives.</p>
                <p>After the catastrophe at Mohâcs and death of Louis . in 1526, a portion of the
                    nobles declared for John Zâpolya, waywode of Transylvania, who was accordingly
                    crowned at Székesfehérvâr (Stuhlweissenburg). Maria, the widow of Louis,
                    immediately summoned a diet of the nobility of the western counties at Pozsony
                    (Pressburg), who pronounced the election of Zâpolya illegal, and proclaimed the
                    queen’s brother, Ferdinand of Austria, king of Hungary (16th December 1526). In
                    the following August Ferdinand, having proceeded to Hungary, was again
                    proclaimed king at Buda; he was afterwards crowned at Székesfehérvâr, 5th

                <p>John Zâpolya, being compelled to retire before the superior forces of Ferdinand,
                    took refuge for a time in Poland, whence he sought the assistance of Soliman II.
                    The sultan listened to his request, and in 1529 conducted a large army into
                    Hungary, took Buda by storm (3d September), reinstated Zâpolya, and drove the
                    Austrians before him to Vienna. Failing to take that city, Soliman in October
                    retraced his steps, and after garrisoning Buda with Turkish troops returned in
                    triumph to Constantinople. After several years of desultory warfare between John
                    and Ferdinand, their rival claims were ultimately settled by a treaty concluded
                    at Nagy värad (Grosswardein) on the 25th February 1538. By this treaty it was
                    stipulated that John was to retâin the title of king, together with Transyl
                    vania and the eastern portion of Hungary then in his possession, whilst
                    Ferdinand was to hold the remainder, with the proviso that John’s male
                    descendants were to surrender all claims to the regal dignity. John having died
                    on the 21st July 1540, his infant son Sigismond was crowned by the adherents of
                    his father, and he was subsequently confirmed in his title to Transylvania by
                    Soliman. This sultan, however, retained a great portion of Hungary in his own
                    possession, and even placed a pasha as regent at Buda; he, moreover, compelled
                    Ferdinand to pay him an annual tribute of 30,000 ducats. Ferdinand, having
                    caused his son Maximilian to be crowned as his successor in 1563, died on the
                    25th July of the following year. When Maximilian succeeded to the throne, he
                    found himself obliged to continue the war with the young Zâpolya, whose cause
                    was espoused by Soliman. In 1566 the sultan, advancing at the head of a large
                    force, was arrested at the small fortress of Sziget by Nicholas Zrinyi, who with
                    a garrison of 3000 men for four weeks heroically defied the whole power of the
                    besiegers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the Map
                    Department of the British Museum there is a curious old print by H. van Schoel
                    (1602), taken from an engraving by A. Lafrery (1566), which represents one of
                    the Turkish attacks upon this fortress.</p></note> Soliman himself died shortly
                    before the final assault on the citadel, which was overpowered only after the
                    destruction of a large part of his army. In the year 1570 Zâpolya concluded
                    peace with Maximilian, and on his death in the following year Stephen Bâthori,
                    with the consent of the sultan Selim, was elected prince of Transylvania.
                    Maximilian, having in 1573 secured the succession of his son Rudolph to the
                    throne of Hungary, died on the 12th October 1576.</p>
                <p>By this time the Reformation had made considerable progress in Hungary, more
                    especially among the higher classes, but with Rudolph the persecution of the
                    Protestants commenced. In Transylvania, however, they met with a protector in
                    Stephen Bâthori, from 1576 to 1586 distinguished as kipg of Poland. In 1604 the
                    Protestants of Hungary, having raised the standard of freedom under Stephen
                    Bocskay, defeated the generals of Rudolph in several engagements, and on the 23d
                    June 1606 they forced him to conclude peace at Vienna, thus securing to
                    themselves for a time their religious liberties. In 1608 Rudolph resigned the
                    kingdom to his brother Matthias, who during his short reign showed great
                    toleration towards the adherents of the Reformed creeds. He died 20th March
                    1619, leaving the crown to his cousin Ferdinand II., the hero of the “Thirty
                    Years’ War.” The accession of this monarch was signalized by the insurrection of
                    the Protestants of Bohemia, and the renewal of persecutions in Hungary, fomented
                    by the Jesuit prelate Peter Pâzmân. But the victories of the Transylvanian
                    prince Bethlen Gâbor (Gabriel BethlerQ over the imperialist troops forced
                    Ferdinand to conclude the treaty of Nikolsburg, 31st December 1621. By this
                    compact the privileges of the Protestants were declared inviolate, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n383/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0383-0370"/> and Bethlen’s claim to the principality of
                    Transylvania and seven counties of Hungary Proper was established. The
                    infringement of this treaty on the part of Ferdinand brought about a renewal of
                    hostilities, which resulted in a second peace, concluded at Pozsony (Pressburg)
                    in 1626. After the death of Bethlen in 1629, the Jesuits succeeded in gaining
                    over several powerful families to the Roman Church, and the religious
                    persecutions were renewed by Ferdinand HL, who succeeded his father in 1637. The
                    Transylvanians had elected George Râkôczy as their prince, who proclaimed
                    himself the protector of Protestantism and of Hungarian liberty. Having drawn up
                    a statement of grievances—those of fhe Protestants in particular—he laid the
                    document before Ferdinand, who, however, paid no attention to it. Râkôczy
                    thereupon collected troops and gained several successes over the imperialists
                    (1644), and in the next year formed a league with the Swedes. This coalition
                    brought Ferdinand into desperate straits, and he therefore soon entered into a
                    treaty of peace with Râkôczy at Linz (16th December 1645). By this treaty,
                    confirmed at the diet held in 1647, Râkôczy was formally recognized as the
                    legitimate prince of Transylvania. He died the year afterwards (1648), and was
                    succeeded by his son George II. Râkôczy. The year 1657 witnessed the death of
                    Ferdinand III., who was succeeded by his second son Leopold I.<note

                <p>During the long reign of this monarch, so injurious to the cause of Hungarian
                    liberty, Hungary was the theatre of intestine wars, insurrections, and the most
                    tragic events. Shortly after his accession, Leopold became involved in war with
                    the Turks, who had created Michael Apaffi. prince of Transylvania in the place
                    of his own partisan John Kemény. The Turks, although at first successful, were
                    ultimately defeated by the imperialists at St Gotthard, 1st August 1664. This
                    victory enabled Leopold to conclude a hasty and disadvantageous peace at Vasvâr
                    (10th August) with the infidels, and to direct his whole energies against the
                    Protestants. The irritation consequent upon this harsh treatment resulted in a
                    conspiracy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Known as
                    “Palatine Wesselényi’s Plot.” The palatine, however, died in 1667, prior to the

                    Peter Zrinyi, Count Frangepan, Francis Râkôczy, and the chief justice Nâdasdi,
                    and had for its object the separation of Hungary from the house of Hapsburg. The
                    plot having been discovered, the leaders were surprised, conveyed to Vienna,
                    and, with the exception of Râkôczy, executed (3Oth April 1671). Although an
                    amnesty was proclaimed on the 6th of June of the same year, Leopold in February
                    1673 appointed a bigoted Catholic, John Caspar Ambringen, governor-general of
                    the kingdom, and made every effort to extirpate the Protestant religion. The
                    oppression becoming at last intolerable, the Protestants again rose in arms
                    under Michael Teleki and Emeric Tökölyi (1678), and were subsequently supported
                    by the grand vizier Kara Mustapha, who in 1683 marched straight to Vienna with a
                    large force. The valour of Sobieski, king of Poland, delivered the city (12th
                    September 1683), and saved Austria from the threatened destruction. In 1686 Buda
                    was taken from the Turks by Charles of Lorraine, and these troublesome foes were
                    at length driven out of most of the provinces and towns of Hungary where they
                    had been settled for about a century and a half. The glory of these achievements
                    was, however, tarnished by the emperor’s revengeful treatment of the Hungarians,
                    hundreds of whom, on suspicion of complicity with the enemy, were put to death
                    upon the scaffold erected in the market-place of Eperies by order of General
                    Carιffa, which remained standing from March</p>
                <p>1687 till the end of the year. Leopold at length granted a general amnesty, but
                    obliged the diet to declare the throne hereditary in the house of Austria, and
                    to abrogate the clause of the Golden Bull which allowed the right of armed
                    resistance to tyranny (31st October 1687). The victories of Prince Eugene, which
                    completed the conquests over the Turks, resulted in the peace of Carlowitz,
                    January 26, 1699, by which the Porte abandoned Hungary and Transylvania to the
                    emperor. On the 5th May 1705 Leopold died, and was succeeded by his eldest son
                    Joseph I. In the year 1703 Francis Râkôczy II. headed a new revolution, which
                    lasted till May 1711, when peace was concluded at Szatmâr by Kâroly, the chief
                    of the Hungarian generals. The emperor Joseph I. died on the 17th April of the
                    same year, and was succeeded by his brother the archduke Charles. From this time
                    until 1848 no open rupture occurred between Hungary and her Hapsburg rulers.</p>
                <p>By the treaty of Passarowitz, concluded 21st July 1718, Temesvâr, the last of the
                    Turkish possessions, reverted to Hungary. In 1722 Charles received the adhesion
                    of the diet to the Pragmatic Sanction, which secured the right of succession to
                    the throne in the female line. At the instigation of Russia hostilities were
                    renewed against the Turks, but Prince Eugene being now dead, and no other leader
                    of equal ability appearing in his place, the Austrians were subjected to a
                    series of disgraceful defeats. These misfortunes were consummated by the
                    humiliating treaty of Belgrade (18th September 1739), in accordance with which
                    the emperor was forced to cede the fortress of Belgrade, with Servia and
                    Austrian Wallachia. On the 20th October of the following year Charles died,
                    leaving the throne to his daughter Maria Theresa. Her claims to the imperial
                    dignity were almost immediately called in question by Prussia, Saxony, France,
                    and Bavaria, and her hereditary dominions were invaded by hostile troops. Maria
                    in despair fled to Pozsony (Pressburg), and summoned the Hungarian diet.
                    Appearing before that assembly on the 11th September 1741, with her infant son
                    Joseph in her arms, she appealed in Latin to the magnanimity and loyal spirit of
                    the nobles. The result of her address was the unanimous declaration on their
                    part: “Moriamur pro ‘ rege nostro ’ Maria Theresa.” Nor was this an empty burst
                    of enthusiasm, for the “insurrectio” or general rise of the nation was
                    proclaimed, and a large army collected, and Hungarian blood was profusely shed
                    in support of her cause. Maria repaid the devotion of her subjects by the zeal
                    which she showed for their welfare, and the salutary changes which she effected
                    in the country. Transylvania was raised into a grand principality (1765), and
                    the town and district of Fiume declared a <hi rend="italic">corpus
                    separatum</hi> of the Hungarian crown (23d April 1779). Maria Theresa also
                    created an Hungarian guard, established several schools, and enlarged the
                    university at Nagyszombat (Tyrnau), which in 1777 was transferred to Buda, and
                    seven years later to Pest. But her efforts to ameliorate the condition of the
                    peasantry, and the reforms which she introduced under the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Urbarium</hi> (1765), which determined the rights of the tenant
                    serfs in relation to the landowners, are among the chief merits of her reign.
                    She died on the 29th November 1780, and was succeeded by her son Joseph II.</p>
                <p>This philosophic monarch was wholly carried away by his zeal for reforms, which
                    were both subversive of the constitution and opposed to the will of the nation.
                    He refused to be crowned in Hungary, and thus avoided the obligations of the
                    usual coronation oath. In defiance of ancient custom he carried the crown of St
                    Stephen to Vienna, dispensed altogether with the use of diets, and governed the
                    country autocratically by decrees. He issued <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0384-0371"/> a general edict of toleration in religious
                    matters (October 1781), but forced upon the people heavy taxes and foreign
                    officials; he moreover enjoined the exclusive use of the German language in the
                    schools, courts of justice, and public administration. The general discontent at
                    these measures was heightened by the unfavourable issue of the war against
                    Turkey; and Joseph, shortly before his death (1790), found himself compelled to
                    revoke nearly all his edicts, and promise redress to his irritated subjects. His
                    brother and successor, Leopold II., appeased the Hungarians by more definitely
                    confirming the rights and liberties of the nation than any of his predecessors.
                    After a reign of only two years Leopold died, and was succeeded by his eldest
                    son Francis I. (1792). This monarch duly swore to maintain the laws and
                    constitution of Hungary, but his efforts were eventually directed wholly against
                    them. During the continuance of his war with France he repeatedly convoked the
                    states, only, however, for the purpose of obtaining supplies of men and money to
                    carry on the struggle. Through the whole of this crisis the Hungarians
                    faithfully supported the Austrian cause, and disdainfully rejected the offers of
                    Napoleon in his proclamation of the 15th May 1809, calling upon them to rise for
                    national independence. But at the end of the great war the Hungarian nation
                    received little gratitude for its devotion. Francis for several years
                    discontinued the holding of the diet, and acted in direct violation of the
                    constitution by levying troops and increasing the taxation to more than double.
                    The opposition which these arbitrary measures provoked in the counties at length
                    obliged him in 1825 to convene the states <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> and thus
                    appease the widespread dissatisfaction.</p>
                <p>To the holding of this diet, in which Count Stephen Széchenyi initiated the use
                    of the Magyar instead of the accustomed Latin tongue, may be traced not only a
                    reaction in favour of the native language, but also the commencement of the
                    reform movement. The spirit of nationality was fully aroused, and liberal
                    sentiments were diffused over the whole kingdom, notwithstanding the active
                    opposition of the Viennese court influenced by Metternich, in the reigns of both
                    Francis and his successor Ferdinand (1835). The diets of 1832, 1839, and 1843
                    passed several measures of reform, amongst which the most important were those
                    demanding the official use of the Magyar language, the equality of the various
                    Christian confessions, and the rights of the peasantry and of the non-ennobled
                    citizens. Amongst the leaders of the liberal party the magnates were Count Louis
                    Batthyânyi and Birons Nicholas Wesselényi and Joseph Eötvös, and the deputies
                    Deék, KlauzAl, Fây, Beöthy, Balogh, Szemere, and Louis Kossuth. In the hope of
                    intimidating the advanced liberals, the Viennese court in 1839 imprisoned
                    Wesselényi and Kossuth, but they were released in 1840 owing to the amnesty then
                    proclaimed for political offenders. The publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pesti</hi><hi rend="italic">Hirlap</hi> (Pest Gazette) was commenced in 1841 by
                    Kossuth as the organ of the liberal party. This paper, the leading articles of
                    which were written in a spirit directly opposed to the policy of the Government,
                    gained an immense circulation, and considerably influenced the public mind. A
                    pamphlet styled <hi rend="italic">A Kelet</hi><hi rend="italic">Népe</hi> (The
                    People of the East), written by Széchenyi in order to counteract the schemes of
                    Kossuth, only served to add to the importance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pesti</hi><hi rend="italic">Hirlap.</hi> The conservative journal <hi
                    rend="italic">Vildg</hi> (Light) was conducted by Count Aurél Dessewffy, who
                    from 1833 until his death in 1842 was the leader of the conservative party.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile intellectual and material improvement made rapid progress, especially
                    in the Hungarian capital. Numerous works, literary and political, were
                    published, the former due to the encouragement offered by the Hungarian academy
                    and the Kisfaludy society, the latter the outcome of the great political
                    excitement prevailing throughout the country. Cluhs really if not avowedly
                    political were established in most of the principal towns. Steam navigation of
                    the Danube, the Budapest suspension bridge (commenced May 1840), and other
                    improvements of the means of internal communication, which had received their
                    first impulse from Count Széchenyi, were rapidly proceeded with. In order to
                    encourage native trade and industry, long obstructed by toll and custom duties,
                    Kossuth called into existence the <hi rend="italic">Védeyylcl</hi> (Protection
                    Union), the members of which pledged themselves to abstain from the use of
                    Austrian manufactures until the tariff should be reformed. This association soon
                    overspread the country, and affected Austrian trade so seriously that some
                    manufacturers had to transport their factories into Hungary in order to save
                    themselves from ruin. The establishment of this association, the liberal
                    measures of the late diets, and the unanimity of national feeling in Hungary
                    Proper and Transylvania embarrassed the Government of Vienna, which could reckon
                    only on the support of the Conservatives, whose numbers and moral influence were
                    comparatively small. Metternich therefore determined to annihilate the municipal
                    independence of the counties, in whose assemblies lay the real strength of the
                    Liberals, by the appointment of “administrators” paid by the court to fill the
                    places of all absent lordlieutenants. This measure raised the political
                    excitement of the nation to the highest pitch. The Liberals were soon divided
                    into two parties, the so-called “municipalists,” with Kossuth at their head, who
                    urged the reaffirmation of the county institutions, and the “centralists,” led
                    by Szalay and Eötvös, who insisted upon the nomination of a responsible
                    ministry. On the approach of the elections for the diet of 1847 these two
                    parties agreed upon a common course of action. In November the diet was
                    summoned, when Kossuth appeared as a candidate for the county of Pest, and after
                    a warm contest was elected. On the 12th November the diet was opened at Pozsony
                    (Pressburg) by Ferdinand V. in person, who by addressing the assembled states in
                    the Magyar language instead of Latin produced a very favourable impression. The
                    first act of the diet was the unanimous election of a successor to the late
                    palatine Joseph in the person of his son the archduke Stepien. Thus far all was
                    well, but the address to the throne containing clauses, inserted by Kossuth’s
                    party, deprecatory of unconstitutional measures by the Government, after passing
                    the lower was rejected by the upper house, by which means the royal speech was
                    practically ignored. At the commencement of the year 1848 an Act was carried
                    through both houses, ordaining the exclusive use of the Magyar language in all
                    branches of the administration, in legal documents, and in the schools and
                    colleges. Certain provisions were, however, made respecting Croatia and
                    Slavonia.</p>
                <p>Upon the news of the French revolution the diet was powerfully impressed, and the
                    Liberals assumed a more determined attitude. On the proposal of Kossuth it was
                    unanimously resolved to send a deputation to Vienna demanding from the
                    Government a responsible ministry, the abolition of all feudal burdens, the
                    equalization of taxes, the extension of the franchise, freedom of the press,
                    complete religious toleration, and several other measures of reform. On the 16th
                    of March the address was presented to Ferdinand, who, by reason of the troubled
                    state of his Italian pro. vinces and the .revolutionary aspect of Vienna, was
                    compelled to yield his assent. The palatine archduke Stephen was nominated
                    viceroy in Hungary, and Count Louis Batthyanyi entrusted with the formation of a
                    ministry. The irritation of the Viennese Government at this enforced compliance
                    with the Hungarian demands was increased by the choice of Kossuth as minister of
                    finance. On the 11th April Ferdinand repaired to Pozsony (Pressburg), and the
                    diet was closed with a Magyar speech from" the thröne.</p>
                <p>But the Austrian Government, although compelled to abandon for the present its
                    position of open and direct hostility to the national will of the Hungarians,
                    was determined by other means to prevent the new reforms from being carried out.
                    The plan adopted was that of secretly encouraging the southern non-Magyar
                    nationalities to assert theiι ’ independence, and oppose by force of arms the
                    consolidation of the new constitution. Croatia and Slavonia and the Bânât
                    refused to submit to the Hungarian rule, and demanded separate rights and
                    autonomous administration; while in Transylvania, the diet of which had
                    proclaimed its reunion with Hungary Proper, the Wallachs and Saxons rose in arms
                    against the Magyars. The whole of the south and south-west of the country was
                    soon in a state of revolt, and a war of races was carried on with indescribable
                    fury. Representations to the court of Vienna remained virtually unheeded, the
                    emperor contenting himself with hypocritical proclamations against the rebels,
                    and with placing at the disposal of the Hungarian ministry a few regiments of
                    soldiers, whose officers were disaffected to the Hungarian cause.</p>
                <p>It now became evident that the Hungarians, in order to retain their national
                    existence, must rely entirely upon their own resources, and make an immediate
                    and vigorous effort, more especially as Jellachich, the newly-appointed ban of
                    Croatia, was making preparations to march upon Pest. Ferdinand, who still <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n385/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0385-0372"/> professed his determination to defend the
                    integrity of the Hungarian monarchy, convoked the diet for the 5th of July, when
                    it was opened by the palatine Stephen, as viceroy. At the suggestion of Kossuth
                    a levy of 200,000 men and ample supplies for the purposes of national defence
                    were unanimously voted; but to these measures Ferdinand withheld his assent. On
                    the 6th of September a deputation of a hundred members arrived at Vienna in
                    order to urge upon the emperor the necessity of taking immediate and decisive
                    steps to oppose the Croatian invasion. On the 9th of September they were
                    admitted to an audience, but, receiving only an evasive answer, they straightway
                    returned to Pest. The abortive result of the deputation, and an official report
                    that Jellachich had crossed the Drave, were announced to the diet on the 11th
                    September, and brought matters to a crisis. A few days later the palatine
                    archduke Stéphen, who at the demand of the diet had set out for the camp, but
                    failed in his efforts at mediation, fled to Austria. The emperor thereupon
                    nominated Count Lamberg royal commissioner and commander-in-chief of all the
                    military forces in Hungary (September 25), but the diet pronounced his
                    appointment illegal and invalid, and he was murdered on the Budapest bridge of
                    boats by the infuriated populace (September 28). The Batthyânyi ministry now
                    resigned, and a committee of national defence was formed under the presidency of
                    Kossuth. On the 29th September, Jellachich, who had advanced to within 25 miles
                    of Buda, was defeated at Velencze, whence he fled towards Vienna during a three
                    days’ armistice that was granted to him by General Moga. Ferdinand now declared
                    openly against the Hungarians, annulled the decrees of the diet, and nominated
                    Jellachich generalissimo of the forces to be employed for the reduction of
                    Hungary. While the Austrian Government, still further exasperated at the march
                    of a Hungarian force to Schwechat (30th October), was preparing for a general
                    invasion, the Hungarian diet hastily equipped a large army to resist it. In the
                    meantime a new Austrian ministry was formed at Vienna, and on the 2d December
                    Ferdinand was induced to resign the imperial throne. He was succeeded by his
                    nephew archduke Francis Joseph, son of Francis Charles, the heir-apparent, who
                    refused to accept the crown. The Hungarian diet, however, protested against this
                    dynastic change as unconstitutional.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of December the main body of the Austrian army under Prince
                    Windischgrätz began to cross the western frontier of Hungary near Bruck on the
                    Leitha, while the Hungarian army of the Upper Danube, commanded by Görgei, who
                    had succeeded Moga, retreated in the direction of Moson (Wieselburg). On the
                    18th December the second Austrian army corps occupied Pozsony (Pressburg), which
                    the Hungarian troops had evacuated, and upon the same day Jellachich, who
                    commanded the first army corps, occupied Moson, compelling Görgei to withdraw
                    towards Györ (Raab). Upon the occupation of this town by the Austrians, on the
                    27th December, Görgei removed to Babolna, where he hoped to effect a junction
                    with Perczel, who had been ordered to reinforce him. But Perczel being overtaken
                    and defeated at Moor on the 29th December by the troops of the ban, was obliged
                    to beat a hasty retreat towards Székesfehérvâr (Stuhlweissenburg). These
                    reverses having rendered Budapest insecure, the diet and the committee of
                    national defence on the 1st January 1849 transferred their seat to Debreczen,
                    and on the night of the 4th and 5th the Hungarian troops marched out of the
                    capital, which on the following day was taken possession of by Windischgrätz.
                    Perczel, who had gathered together the remains of his corps at Budapest,
                    followed the Government by way of Szolnok, while Görgei made a flank movement to
                    the north, and led his corps by a circuitous route through the Carpathians to
                    join the army on the Theiss. Windischgrätz, mindful of Schwechat, and, regarding
                    the Hungarians as rebels, had refused to listen to a deputation headed by Count
                    Bat⅛yanyi making proposals of peace, and Batthyânyi himself wa⅛ arrested. While
                    the Austrian generals were making this rapid progress in Hungary Proper, the
                    Polish general Bern had succeeded in organizing a large force in Transylvania,
                    by means of which he reduced the refractory Wallachs to subjection, and drove
                    the Austrians out of the principality, which had been forced to submit to
                    General Puchner.</p>
                <p>In the diet now held at Debreczen Kossuth declared that the nation was on the
                    verge of destruction, and could only be saved by extraordinary measures. But the
                    inactivity of Windischgrätz, who, instead of hastening onwards to the Theiss,
                    remained for several weeks at Pest, gave the committee of national defence time
                    to concentrate its forces, procure war material, and make other provisions for a
                    determined resistance. On the 12th of February Görgei arrived at Kassa
                    (Kaschau), and the two Hungarian armies could now act in concert. Meanwhile the
                    national cause made little progress in the south, a great portion of which was
                    in the hands of the enemy. On the 14th February the fortress of Eszék in
                    Slavonia was lost to the Hungarians; that of Lipôtvâr (Leopoldstadt) in the
                    north had already fallen on the 2d of the same month.</p>
                <p>At length the main body of the Austrians under Windischgrätz advanced, and
                    attacked the Hungarians under the Polish general Dembinski on the 26th and 27th
                    February at Kâpolna. The battle, though obstinately contested, proved
                    indecisive, and the Hungarians were obliged to retire beyond the Theiss in order
                    to recruit their forces. A few days later, however, an Hungarian corps,
                    withdrawn from the lower Danube, and commanded by Damjanics, routed the
                    Austrians under Grammont at Szolnok (5th March). Meanwhile the Russians, coming
                    to the aid of the Austrians, had penetrated into Transylvania and occupied
                    Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt) and Brassô (Kronstadt), but the Hungarians under Bern
                    regained these fortresses on the 11th and 20th March, and drove the Russians
                    into Wallachia.</p>
                <p>By the middle of March au army of 120,000 men, provided with excellent generals
                    and ample artillery, was concentrated on the Theiss. Towards the end of the
                    month the Hungarians crossed the river at various points, and advanced on the
                    road to Pest, under the command of Görgei, Damjanics, Aulich, Klapka, and
                    others,— Guyon having been nominated to the commandership of Komârom (Komorn),
                    the relief of which was the ultimate object of the campaign. The leadership of
                    the Hungarian forces had meanwhile passed from Dembinski to Vetter, on account
                    of whose ill-health it was provisionally transferred on the 31st March to
                    Görgei. From this time the Austrians had to. endure a rapid succession of
                    defeats, —at Hatvan (April 2), Tâpiô-Bicske (April 4), Isaszeg (April 6),
                    Gödöllö (April 7), and Vacz or Waitzen (April 10). In consequence of these
                    reverses Windischgrätz was recalled, and the chief command of the Austrian
                    troops was given to Baron Weiden (April 12). In order to prevent the relief of
                    Komarom, Weiden opposed the advance of Görgei with a force under Wohlgemuth,
                    which was, however, defeated by Damjanics on the 19th April at Nagy-Sarlo, so
                    that on the 22d the relief of the fortress of Komarom was effected upon the left
                    bank of the Danube, Guyon having previously succeeded in passing through the
                    hostile lines. The subsequent rout of the besieging forces at Uj-Szöny on the
                    26th April completed the discomfiture of the Austrians, and forced them to fly
                    to the frontier. The ban Jellachich meanwhile retreated to Croatia, and nearly
                    the whole country was once more in the hands of the Hungarians.</p>
                <p>In the midst of these victories Kossuth proposed in the diet at Debreczen the
                    dethronement of the Hapsburg dynasty, and upon the 14th April an act to that
                    effect was almost unanimously passed, although afterwards unfavourably received
                    by Görgei and a large portion of the army. The chief provocation to the passing
                    of this extreme and, as it eventually proved, unfortunate measure was the
                    promulgation of the new constitution on the 4th March by the emperor Francis
                    Joseph, which made a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa</hi> of all the time-honoured
                    laws, rights, and privileges of Hungary. The substance of the declaration of
                    independence was as follows: “That the house of Hapsburg, having violated the
                    integrity of the kingdom, treacherously levied war against the nation, and
                    called in the aid of a foreign power to accomplish its aims, has trampled under
                    foot all the treaties that united it to Hungary, and is therefore declared for
                    ever excluded from the Hungarian throne.” The form of government was to be
                    settled afterwards by the diet, but in the meantime Kossuth was nominated
                    governor, the committee of national defence was dissolved, and a new responsible
                    ministry formed under the presidency of Szemere.</p>
                <p>It is generally admitted that, had the Hungarians followed up their victories by
                    an immediate march upon Vienna, they would have been able to force the Austrian
                    Government to terms, and thus have warded off the Russian invasion, the
                    preparations for which were now being conducted upon an enormous scale. Instead,
                    however, of acting on the offensive across the Austrian frontier, the Hungarian
                    commander-in-chief, Görgei, after a few days delay at Komarom, made a retrograde
                    movement towards the Hungarian capital. On the 4th May he arrived before Buda,
                    which was still in the possession of the Austrians, but it was in vain that he
                    summoned the commander Hentzi to surrender. On the 15th began the regular
                    bombardment of the fortress, and on the 21st it was taken by assault. On the 5th
                    of June Kossuth made his entry into Pest, and the diet having adjourned its
                    sittings at Debreczen, the Government returned to the capital. Every preparation
                    was now set on foot for a desperate defence against the combined armies of
                    Russia and Austria, which by the middle of the month had completed their
                    arrangements, and had begun to invade the country at various points. Prince
                    Paskewitch advanced from Galicia at the head of the main body of the Russian
                    army, consisting of over 100,000 men, while Haynau crossed the western frontier
                    with an Austrian force of 60,000, supported by a Russian division of 12,000
                    under Paniutin. On the Drave and the Stγrian frontier Nugent commanded 12,000,
                    and near Eszék was Jellachich with 25,000 men. In Transylvania the combined
                    Austrian and Russian forces under Puchner and Lüders amounted to 60,000; so
                    that, including the garrisons of the fortresses in their hands, the allied
                    forces were in all not less than 275,000 men with 600 guns. The whole available
                    forces of Hungary did not amount to more than half this number, the army of the
                    Upper Danube under Görgei being 50,000, that of Perczel and Vecsey^in the south
                    30,000, the army of the north under Dembinski 12,000; while there were about
                    32,000 men under <pb break="no"

                    Kazinczy in the county of Maramaros. On the 19th of J une the Russian corps
                    under Lüders burst through the Red Tower Pass into Transylvania, and, having
                    defeated the Hungarians, took the fortress of Nagy-Szeben, whilst in the
                    following month Brasso in like manner surrendered to the Austrians. Jellachich
                    was, however, defeated on the 14th July at Hegyes, and forced to retire from the
                    Bacska. In the meantime Haynau’s operations on the Danube met with general
                    success, while the Russian main army advanced over Eperies and Kassa into the
                    interior of the country. These disasters to the Hungarian cause were aggravated
                    by the want of unanimity between the Hungarian commander-in-chief and the
                    Government, which, being again obliged to leave Pest, transferred its seat to
                    Szeged (July 11). After various sanguinary engagements with the invading forces
                    in the vicinity of Komârom, Görgei on the night of the 12th July left the
                    fortress under the charge of Klapka. On the 15th and 17th Görgei encountered the
                    Russians at Vacz, and proceeded thence over Vad-kert, Losoncz, and Rimaszombat,
                    where on the 21st the Russian offers of truce were refused. Görgei, closely
                    followed, finally crossed the Theiss on the 28th July near Tokay, whence he
                    proceeded in the direction of Nagyvârad (Grosswardein) by routes to the east of
                    Debreczen. There on the 2d August his first army corps under Nagy Sandor was
                    defeated by the troops of Paskewitch. The Government had meanwhile removed to
                    Arad, which fortress, having previously surrendered to the Hungarians, was made
                    the last point of general concentration. In Transylvania the army of Bern had
                    been overpowered on the 31st July at Segesvär (Schässburg); and in Hungary
                    Proper Dembin ski retreated first to Szeged and Szoreg, whence he was repulsed
                    on the 5th August by Haynau, and afterwards to Temesvâr. There on the 9th he
                    suffered an overwhelming defeat. Upon the news of this catastrophe reaching Arad
                    on the night of the 10th to llth, Görgei, who had already arrived there on the
                    9th by forced marches from Nagyvârad, induced Kossuth and the few ministers who
                    were with him to lay down their authority, and upon the 11th received from them
                    the supreme civil and military command. On the evening of the same day, after
                    the departure of Kossuth for Lugos, the new dictator, believing further
                    resistance hopeless, communicated with the Russian general Rüdiger, offering to
                    surrender at discretion. The sally of Klapka from Komarom, and his signal
                    victory over the besieging Austrian army (August 3), were unknown at Arad. On
                    August 13 Görgei surrendered his army, consisting of some 24,000 men with 140
                    guns, to Rüdiger at Szöllös near Vilagos; on the 16th Kazinczy followed with his
                    troops, and on the 17th Damjanics gave up the fortress of Arad, and on the 5th
                    September a similar fate befell Peterwardein.</p>
                <p>A few thousand men followed Bern and Guyon to Turkey, whither Kossuth and the
                    late ministers Szemere, Casimir Batthyânyi, and Mészâros, and the military
                    leaders Dembinski, Vetter, Perczel, Kmetty, and Wysocki also escaped. On the 2d
                    to 5th October Komarom capitulated on honourable terms, General Klapka having
                    refused to surrender until an amnesty and free passports had been granted by the
                    Austrians. On the 6th October Aulich, Damjanics, Dessewffy, Kiss, Knézich,
                    Lahner, Lâzàr, Leiningen, Nagy-Sândor, Pöltenberg, Schweidel, Török, and Vecsey
                    met their end at Arad. On the same day Count Louis Batthyanyi, and subsequently
                    Prince Woronieczki, Baron Jeszenak, Csanyi, Perényi, and others suffered at
                    Pest. By a decree of Haynau, to whom the Russians had delivered up the prisoners
                    of war, all officers below the rank of a general, if not consigned to prison,
                    were pressed as privates into the Austrian service. The Hungarian
                    commander-inchief Görgei, however, was pardoned, and interned at Klagenfurt in
                    Carinthia.</p>
                <p>Hungary now lay entirely prostrate, and was treated as a conquered country. The
                    Russians retreated to the north and east, leaving the Austrians with their
                    commander Haynau, who availed himself of the summary powers conferred on him by
                    the state of siege to inflict the greatest cruelties on the vanquished people.
                    Many of the Hungarian nobility were condemned to long terms of imprisonment; the
                    estates of the richer patriots were confiscated; and numerous Austrian and
                    Bohemian officials were thrust upon the exhausted country. A rigorous,
                    censorship of the press was at the same time enforced. At length, in July 1850,
                    Haynau was removed from the chief authority. A milder regime was inaugurated by
                    the archduke Albrecht, who arrived at Pest on the 14th October 1851 as the new
                    civil and military governor. But it was only after the visit of the emperor to
                    Hungary (5th June to 14th August 1852) that the military courts were closed. The
                    whole country, now reduced to a province of the Austrian empire, was placed
                    under the direct control of the central Government at Vienna. On the 1st May
                    1853 the new organization was carried into effect, and the Austrian civil code
                    made applicable to Hungary. On the 8th September the Hungarian insignia of
                    royalty, which had disappeared from Arad at the time of Kossuth’s flight, were
                    discovered in the neighbourhood of Orsova; they were conveyed on the 19th to
                    Vienna, but were afterwards transferred to Buda. On the 17th April 1854 the
                    state of siege was abolished, and on the 12th July 1856 an amnesty was
                    proclaimed. On the 4th May of the following year the emperor visited Hungary,
                    and on the 9th of the same month granted the restoration of their confiscated
                    estates to late political offenders. In August he commenced a second progress
                    through his Hungarian dominions, and availed himself of the opportunity to
                    express his sentiments of consideration for the people.</p>
                <p>Indeed, from this time (1857) both the emperor and the Government of Vienna
                    seemed desirous of making the Hungarians forget the troubles of 1848 and 1849 by
                    concessions to the national will, whilst the encouragement given to improvements
                    in the means of communication, and to the new projects for the regulation of the
                    Theiss, as. also the schemes for the colonization of sparsely populated
                    districts, are well worthy of notice. During the year the railways from Szeged
                    to Temesvar and from Szolnok to Debreczen were opened. By an imperial decree
                    issued at the end of 1858 agricultural colonists, it of one nationality and
                    creed, were allowed to settle in various parts of Hungary, with special
                    exemptions from taxation. By a ministerial order of the 8th August 1859 the
                    language used in the higher schools was for the future to be regulated according
                    to circumstances of nationality, the predominance of German being thereby
                    abolished. On the 21st of the same month the absolutist minister Bach was
                    dismissed, in consequence of the ill-success of the Italian war, which was
                    attributed to his ill-advised policy against the various nationalities of the
                    realm. The so-called “Protestant patent” of September 1st, which ostensibly
                    granted the communes the free administration of their own educational and
                    religious. matters, was, however, the cause of much dissatisfaction, and more
                    than 2,800,000 Protestants petitioned for its withdrawal. In April 1860 the
                    archduke Albrecht was at his own desire removed from the civil and military
                    governorship of Hungary, and the master of the ordnance, Benedek, a native
                    Magyar, was appointed in his stead. The Hungarian members in the Reiehsräth,
                    specially summoned for the purpose of finding a definite form of settlement for
                    the whole empire, now put forward claims for the autonomy of their country, and
                    by an imperial diploma of the 20th October their wishes were partly met. Benedek
                    was removed from the general governorship of the kingdom, whilst the Hungarian
                    court chancellery was restored, and Baron Vay nominated chancellor. At the same
                    time the <hi rend="italic">curia regia</hi> (supreme court of judicature) and
                    the county assemblies were reinstituted, and the Magyar recognized as the
                    official language. Furthermore, the emperor on the 27th December granted the
                    reannexation of the Temesvar Bânat to Hungary Proper. In the following February
                    it was decreed that their former constitutions should be restored to Hungary,
                    Transylvania, and Croatia and Slavonia, and on the 6th of April the diet met at
                    Buda, afterwards removing to Pest. But as the address sent to Vienna in June
                    demanded the fullest autonomy for Hungary, and the Hungarians refused to yield
                    their claims, in spite of the emperor’s declared inability to accede, the diet
                    was dissolved by imperial decree on the 22d August. Meanwhile a new Hungarian
                    court chancellor had been appointed in the person of Count Forgâch. Stringent
                    measures were taken by the Government of Vienna to counteract the organized
                    passive resistance of the counties, and in many places the payment of the taxes
                    was enforced by military aid. On the 27th October the holding of all public
                    county meetings was forbidden, and administratore or coadjutors were in many
                    counties thrust upon the lord-lieutenants, who were forced to submit to the
                    authority of the newly-appointed Government superintendent Count Palffy de
                    Erdöd. On the 18th November 1862 a general amnesty was granted to those who were
                    implicated by their hostility to the late Government measures. In the summer of
                    1863 Hungary suffered from a severe famine, but the Reichsrath voted 20 million
                    florins to alleviate the distress. On the 22d April 1864 Count Forgâch was
                    replaced by Count Arminius Zichy, who, on account of his unpopularity, was on
                    the 26th June 1865 removed for Count George Majlath, a Conservative. In a visit
                    to Budapest on the 6th to 9th June 1865, the emperor declared his willingness to
                    do justice to the constitutional demands of the Hungarians, as far as was
                    consistent with the integrity of the empire. On the 18th July Count Palffy de
                    Erdöd was replaced by Baron Sennyey, one of the leaders of the old Conservative
                    party. On the 14th December the diet was opened by the emperor in person, who
                    assented to the principle of self-government for Hungary, and agreed to
                    recognize the Pragmatic Sanction as the basis of a settlement of the questions
                    involved. The diet, however, demanded also an acknowledgment of the continuity
                    of the constitutional rights of 1848. After the outbreak of the war between
                    Austria and Prussia the diet was prorogued (26th June 1866). Upon its reopening
                    on the 19th November an imperial rescript was read in which the emperor
                    acquiesced in the Hungarian demands for constitutional self-government, and
                    promised to appoint a responsible ministry. The result of the “compromise”
                    effected by Baron Beust between the Austrian Government and the committee,
                    headed by Deâk, empowered by the Hungarian diet, was the dualistic system of the
                    Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, as finally sanctioned on the 18th February 1867.
                    This arrangement secured to Hungary the restoration of the constitutional,
                    legal, and administrative autonomy of 1848, while the supreme command <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0387-0374"/> and direction of the army were assigned to the
                    emperor-king. A responsible ministry, including Barons Wenckheim and Eötvös,
                    Count Mikô, Melchior Lonyay, and others, was formed on the 20th February 1867,
                    under the presidency of Count Andrâssy. Ou the 8th of the following June the
                    emperor and empress were crowned king and queen of Hungary at Budapest, and a
                    complete pardon was proclaimed to all political offenders both at home and
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>The reconciliation of the Magyars with the Hapsburg dynasty being thus complete,
                    both parties sought to throw a veil over the past by mutual concessions.
                    Transylvania was incorporated with Hungary Proper, and a joint commercial
                    contract was entered upon between Hungary and Austria. In like manner foreign
                    affairs and joint finance were assigned to “common ministries.” On the 8th of
                    August 1868 the Hunga. bin house of representatives accepted the dual Government
                    military scheme, by which the standing army remained under the direction of the
                    imperial ministry of war. The <hi rend="italic">Honvéd</hi> (home defence) army
                    obtained its own special organization and commander-in-chief. The long-existing
                    misunderstanding between Hungary and Croatia was at length settled by the
                    agreement concluded in September, which placed the relations of Croatia to the
                    Hungarian crown on a more equable footing than hitherto. After the passing of
                    various other measures of reform, including the emancipation of the Jews, a
                    compulsory education act, and a special act (November 29) for the consolidation
                    of all nationalities under the crown of St Stephen, the session of the Hungarian
                    diet was closed on the 10th December 1868. In the elections for the next session
                    (1869-72) the Deâk party, which had taken the lead in the previous diet, were
                    returned by a large majority, and in the new diet, opened April 23, 1869, the
                    policy of conciliation still prevailed. The ministry from time to time underwent
                    certain modifications, owing to the death of Baron Eötvös, the minister of
                    education (February 1871), the appointment of Count Lonyay (May 1870) to the
                    imperial ministry of finance, and his subsequent nomination to the presidency of
                    the Hungarian council in the place øf Count Andrâssy, who in November 1871
                    succeeded Beust as foreign minister of Austria-Hungary. Meanwhile the finances
                    of Hungary were becoming rapidly embarrassed owing to the repeated contraction
                    since 1867 of enormous loans for state railways and costly public works. The
                    elections of 1872 were, however, again favourable to the Deâk faction. At the
                    end of November Lonyay retired from the presidency of the ministry, and on the
                    1st December was succeeded by Szlâvy, who in March 1873 obtained the consent of
                    the diet to some additional taxes. In August the Military Frontier districts
                    were placed under civil jurisdiction, the eastern portion or the Servian-Banat
                    frontier being incorporated with Hungary Proper. The new cabinet was not more
                    fortunate than that which had preceded it in a solution of the financial
                    question, and in March 1874 made room for a coalition ministry under Bitto, with
                    Ghyczy as finance minister. Upon its resignation in February 1875, in
                    consequence of the refusal of the house to grant further taxation, a strong
                    liberal combination was formed by Tisza from members of the left and of the
                    former Deâk party. The new ministry, under the presidency of Wenckheim (3d
                    March), was supported by an overwhelming majority in the elections for the new
                    session (1875-78). On the 16th October Tisza, minister of the interior, was
                    nominated president, and the financial difficulty was met by an advance in the
                    income tax, and a fresh loan. The death of Deâk on the 29th January 1876 casta
                    gloom over the whole country. For some time previously he had withdrawn from the
                    field of politics, where less moderate but more distinctly Magyarizing
                    tendencies now prevailed. By its resolutions of the 24th and 27th March 1876 the
                    diet deprived of their former privileges the so-called “Saxon” sees and
                    districts in Transylvania. From these new counties were formed on the system
                    adopted for the rest of Hungary, and were placed under the general
                    administration. The number of royal free towns in Hungary was, moreover, much
                    reduced, especially in the Transylvanian circle. The insurrectionary state of
                    the Slavic provinces of Turkey excited the apprehensions of the Magyars with
                    regard to the Slav races of southern Hungary, and aroused a strong feeling of
                    sympathy for the Porte. This was still further increased by the attitude of
                    Russia, and the cordiality towards the Magyars evinced by the sultan Abdul Hamid
                    II., who in 1877 presented the university of Budapest with a portion of the
                    remains of the library of Matthias Corvinus. During the course of the war
                    between Turkey and Russia the Magyars were with difficulty restrained from open
                    manifestations in favour of the former and against the latter power.
                    Nevertheless, after the conclusion of peace, Hungary had, in conformity with the
                    requirements of Art. XXV. of the Berlin Treaty (July 1878), to furnish her quota
                    of troops for the occupation of Bosnia and the Herzegovina, a task effected only
                    with a considerable loss of men, and an additional burden on the state finances.
                    The diet having been closed by the king on the 30th June, the new elections weιe
                    held at the time the struggle for the occupation of Bosnia was progressing. The
                    popular excitement in Hungary Proper was very great, both on account of the
                    losses suffered by the Hungarian troops and the destruction by a violent
                    thunderstorm of the town of Miskolcz. On the 3d October Széll, minister of
                    finance, resigned office; other ministers also tendered their resignations, but
                    were induced to retain their posts for a time. In the elections the majority of
                    votes had fallen to the Liberal or Government party. On the 20th October the
                    Hungarian parliament was opened, and at the beginning of December the
                    reconstruction of the ministry was completed, the only new members being, for
                    finance Count Szapâry, and for commerce Baron Kemény. On the 14th a sum of
                    20,000,000 florins was granted for the occupation expenses of the following
                    year.</p>
                <p>Early in the spring of 1879 the attention of all parties was for a time
                    distracted from political matters by the disastrous inundation of Szeged. At the
                    beginning of May the friendly relations of the non-Magyar nationalities of
                    Hungary, and more particularly of the Roumanians of Transylvania, towards the
                    Magyars seemed to be endangered by the passing of the amended education bill
                    ordering the state language to be taught in all the non-Magyar primary schools.
                    The new law, as affecting many nationalities, is likely to have an important
                    bearing on the future of Hungary. The urgent necessity for more extended river
                    embankments and a better system of dykes and dredging in the water-coursed
                    levels of the midland Trans-Tisian counties became more than ever apparent in
                    December, when inundations of the triple Körös and the Maros submerged many
                    villages, farms, and pasturages, devastated large portions of Nagyvärad
                    (Grosswardein), Arad, and other low-lying communes, and rendered thousands of
                    persons homeless. In March 1880 a loan of 40,000,000 florins was raised for the
                    purposes of regulating the Theiss and the Maros, and of rebuilding and securing
                    the town of Szeged.</p>

                <p>Although for nearly a thousand years established in Europe and subjected to Aryan
                    influences, the Magyar language has yet retained its essential Turanian
                    features, and the etymology and syntax still preserve these as their chief
                    characteristics. The grammatical forms are expressed, as in Turkish, by means of
                    affixes modulated according to the high or low vowel power of the root or chief
                    syllables of the word with which they are connected,—the former being

                    articulations, and inseparable as consonants, are used to make up the deficiency

                    are the use of the singular substantive after numerals, and adjectives of

                    Professor Charles 01mosy”; and the possessive forms of the nouns, which are
                    varied according to the number and person of the possessor and the number of the

                    presenting no auxiliary verb “to have,” no primitive possessive pronouns, no
                    gender nor even separate pronominal forms and terminations for the distinction
                    of the sexes, and (suffixed syllables or postpositions being used instead)
                    hardly any true declension for objective terms, the Magyar far surpasses every
                    Teutonic, Slavonic, Italic, and other Indo-European or Aryan language in the
                    wealth of its verbal formations, as also in the power of harmonizing and
                    assimilating the determinatives to the roots. Logical in its derivatives and in
                    its grammatical structure, the Magyar language is, moreover, copious in
                    idiomatic expressions, rich in its store of words, and almost musical in its
                    harmonious intonation. It is, therefore, admirably adapted for both literary and
                    rhetorical purposes.</p>

                    published at Klausenburg in 1794; and the various grammars for the use of

                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Literature.</hi></p>
                <p>The comparatively restricted and unobtrusive character of the Magyar or native
                    Hungarian literature is partly owing to the fact that there are so many other
                    languages current in Hungary, but it is chiefly to be attributed to the almost
                    exclusive recognition, through many centuries, of Latin as the vehicle of
                    cultured thought. The Romish ecclesiastics who settled in Hungary during the
                    11th century, and who found their way into the chief offices of the state, were
                    mainly instrumental in establishing Latin as the predominant language of the
                    court, the higher schools, and public worship, and of eventually introducing it
                    into the administration. Having thus become the tongue of. the educated and
                    privileged classes, Latin continued to monopolize the chief fields of literature
                    until the revival of the native language at the close of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>Amongst the earliest Latin works that claim attention are the “Chronicle” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Gesta Hungarorum),</hi> by the “anonymous notary” of King Béla,

                    that it was Béla I., and that consequently the “anonymous notary " belongs
                    rather to the 11th than to the 12th century.</p></note><hi rend="italic"

                <p>As there are no traces of literary productions in the native or Magyar dialect
                    before the 12th century, the early condition of the language is concealed from
                    the philologist. It is, however, known that the Hungarians had their own martial
                    songs, and that their princes kept lyre and lute players who sang festal odes in
                    praise of the national heroes. In the 11th century Christian teachers introduced
                    the use of the Roman letters,but the employment of the Latin language was not
                    formally decreed until 1114 (see Bowring, <hi rend="italic">Poetry, of the
                    Magyars,</hi> Introd. xix. ). It appears, moreover, that up to that date public
                    business was transacted in Hungarian, for the decrees of KingColoman the Learned
                    (1095-1114) were translated from that language into Latin. Among the literary
                    relics of the 12th century are the ‘ ‘ Latiatuc” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Halotti</hi><hi rend="italic">Beszéd</hi> funeral discourse and prayer in

                    evident that from time to time the native language continued to be employed as a

                    Magyar became the language of the court. That it was used also in official
                    documents and ordinances is shown by copies of formularies of oaths, the import

                    did Magyar begin in any sense to replace Latin for literary purposes. The period
                    placed by Hungarian authors between 1437 and 1530 marks the first development of
                    Magyar literature.</p>

                    chroniclers of the 16th century, were Csanadi, Tinôdi, Nagy-Baczai, Bogati,
                    Ilôsvay, Istvanfi, Görgei, Temesvâri, and Valkai. Of these the best and. most
                    prolific writer was Tinôdi. Székely wrote in prose, with verse introduction, a
                    “Chronicle of the World” under the title of <hi rend="italic">Cronica ezvildgnac
                    yeles</hi><hi rend="italic">dolgairöl</hi> (Cracow, 1559). Csaktornya and Kakony
                    imitated the ancient classical poets, and Erdösi introduced the hexameter.
                    Andrew Farkas and the homilist Peter Melius (Juhasz) attempted didactic verse;
                    and Batizi busied himself with sacred song and Biblical history. During the
                    latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th two poets of a
                    higher order appeared in Valentine Balassa, the earliest Magyar lyrical writer,
                    and his contemporary John Rimay, whose poems are of a contemplative and pleasing
                    character.</p>
                <p>The melancholy state of the country consequent upon the persecutions of Rudolph
                    I., Ferdinand II., and Leopold I., as also the continual encroachment of
                    Germanizing influences under the Hapsburgs, were unfavourable to the development
                    of the national literature during the next literary period, dating from the
                    Peace of Vienna (1606) to that of Szatmar (1711). A few names were, however,
                    distinguished in theology, philology, and poetry. In 1626 a Hungarian version of
                    the Vulgate was published at Vienna by the Jesuit George Kai di,<note

                    not published till 1717 at Leyden, twenty-nine years after his death.<note

                    the Jesuit Peter Pazman, eventually primate, Nicholas Eszterhâzy, Sâmbâr,
                    Balâsfi, and others were the authors of various works of a polemical nature.
                    Especially famous was the <hi rend="italic">Hodoegus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >kalauz</hi> of Pazmân, which first appearedat Pozsony(Pressburg) in 1613. Among
                    the Protestants who exerted themselves in theological and controversial writings
                    were Németi, Alvinczy, Alexander Felvinczy, Marton-falvi, and Melotai, who was
                    attached to the court of Bethlen Gabor. Telkibauyai wrote on “English
                    Puritanism” (1654). The Calvinist Albert Molnar, already mentioned, was more
                    especially remarkable for his philological than for his theological labours.
                    Parispâpai compiled an Hungarian-Latin Dictionary, <hi rend="italic"

                    (Utrecht, 1653). John Szalardi, Paul Lisznyai, Gregory Pethö, JohnKemény, and
                    Benjamin Szilâgyi, which last, however, wrote in Latin, were the authors of
                    various historical works. In polite literature the heroic poem Zriπywisz(l651),
                    descriptive of the fall of Sziget, by Nicholas Zrinyi, grandson of the defender
                    of that fortress, marks a new era in Hungarian poetry. Of a far inferior
                    character was the monotonous <hi rend="italic">Mohdcsi veszedelem</hi> (Disaster
                    of Mohâcs), in 13 cantos, produced two years afterwards at Vienna by Baron
                    Liszti. The lyric and epic poems of Stephen Gyöngyösi, who sang the deeds of
                    Maria Széchy, the heroine of MUrany, <hi rend="italic">Murdnyi Venus</hi>
                    (Kassa, 1664), are samples rather of a general improvement in the style than of
                    the purity of the language. As a didactic and elegiac poet Stephen Kohari is
                    much esteemed, though his poems are of a very serious and contemplative turn.
                    More fluent but not less gloomy are the sacred lyrics of Nyéki-Veres first

                <p>The period comprised between the peace of Szatmar (1711) and the year 1772 is far
                    more barren in literary results than even that which preceded it. The exhaustion
                    of the nation from its protracted civil and foreign wars, the extinction of the
                    court of the Transylvanian princes where the native language had been cherished,
                    and the prevalent use of Latin in the schools, public transactions, and county
                    courts, all combined to bring about a complete neglect of the Magyar language
                    and literature. Among the few prose writers of distinction were Andrew Spangâr,
                    whose ‘ ‘ Hungarian Bookstore,” <hi rend="italic">Magyar Konyvtdr</hi> (Kassa,
                    1738), is said to be the earliest work of the kind in the Magyar dialect; George
                    Bârânyi, who translated the New Testament (Lauba, 1754); the historians Michael
                    Cserei and Matthew Bél, which last, however, wrote chiefly in Latin; and Peter
                    Bod, who besides his theological treatises compiled a history of Hungarian
                    literature under the title <hi rend="italic">Magyar</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Athénds</hi> (Szeben, 1766). But the most celebrated writer of this period was
                    the Jesuit Francis Faludi, the translator, through the Italian, of William
                    Darrell’s works. On account of the classic purity of his style in prose Faludi
                    was known as the “Magyar Cicero.” Not only as a philosophic and didactic writer,
                    but also as a lyric and dramatic poet he surpassed all his contemporaries.
                    Another pleasing lyric poet of this period was Ladislaus Amade, the naturalness
                    and genuine sentiment of whose lightly running verses are suggestive of the love
                    songs of Italian authors. Of considerable merit are also the sacred lyrical
                    melodies of Paul Radai in his <hi rend="italic">Lelki hodolds</hi> (Spiritual
                    Homage), published at Debreczen in 1715. Among the didactic poets may be
                    mentioned Lewis Nagy, George Kalmar, John Illey, and Paul Bertalanfi, especially
                    noted for his rhymed “Life of St Stephen, first Hungarian king,” <hi

                <p>The remaining three literary periods stand in special relationship to one
                    another, and are sometimes regarded as the same. The first two, marking
                    respectively the progress of the “Regeneration of the Native Literature”
                    (1772-1807) and the “Revival of the Language” (1807-1830), were introductory to
                    and preparatory for the third or “Academy” period, which dates from the year
                    1830, and comprises the results of the native language and literature in the
                    highest state of cultivation.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the general neglect of the Magyar language during the reigns of
                    Maria Theresa and her successor Joseph II., the more important prose productions
                    of the latter part of the 18th century, as for instance the historical works of
                    George Pray, Stephen Katona, John Engel, and Ignatius Fessler, were written
                    either in Latin or in German. The reaction in favour of the native literature
                    manifested itself at first chiefly in the creation of various schools of poetry.
                    Foremost among these stood the so-called “French” school, founded by George
                    Bessenyei, the author of several dramatic pieces, and of an imitation of Pope’s
                    “Essay on Man,” under the title of <hi rend="italic">Az embernekprdbdja</hi>
                    (Vienna, 1772). Bessenyei introduced the use of rhymed alexandrines in place of
                    the monotonous Zrinian measure. Other writers of the same school were Laurence
                    Orczy and Abraham Barcsay, whose works have a striking resemblance to each
                    other, and were published together by Rêvai (1789). The songs and elegies of the
                    short-lived Paul Anyos, edited by Bacsânyi in 1798, show great depth of feeling.
                    Versifiers and adapters from the French appeared also in Counts Adam and Joseph
                    Teleki, Alexander Bârôczi, and Joseph Péczeli, known also as the translator of
                    Young’s “Night Thoughts.” The chief representatives of the strictly “classical”
                    school, which adopted the ancient Greek and Latin authors as its models, were
                    David Barôti Szabo, Nicholas Rêvai, Joseph Râjnis, and Benedict Virâg. Among the
                    most noteworthy works of Barôti are the <hi rend="italic">Uj</hi><hi

                    linguistic labours have already been alluded to (see above, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Language)</hi>; but as a poet he may be considered superior to Rajnis,
                    translator of Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Bucolics</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    under Virâg, whose poetical works, consisting chiefly of Horatian odes and
                    epistles, on account of the perfection of their style, obtained for him the name
                    of the “Magyar Horace.” The <hi rend="italic">Poctai Mιmkai</hi> (Poetical
                    Works) of Virag were published at Pest in 1799, and again in 1822. Of his prose
                    works the most important is the <hi rend="italic">Magyar Szdzadok</hi> or
                    “Pragmatic History of Hungary” (Buda, 1808 and 1816). Vâlyi-Nagy, the first
                    Magyar translator of Homer, belongs rather to the “popular” than the “classical”
                    school. His translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> appeared at
                    Sarosρatak in 1821. The . establishment of the “national” or “popular” school is
                    attributable chiefly to Andrew Dugonics, though Ins earliest works, <hi
                    rend="italic">Troja</hi><hi rend="italic">veszcdelme</hi> (1774) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ulysses</hi> (1780), indicate a classical bias. His national
                    romances, however, and especially <hi rend="italic">Etelka</hi> (Pozsony, 1787)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Az arany per-eczek</hi> (Pest and Pozsony, 1790),
                    attracted public attention, and were soon adapted for the stage. The most
                    valuable of his productions is his collection of “Hungarian Proverbs and Famous
                    Sayings,” which appeared in 1820 at Szeged, under the title of <hi rend="italic"

                    monddsok.</hi> The most noteworthy follower of Dugonics was Adam Horvath, author
                    of the epic poems <hi rend="italic">Hunnidsz</hi> (Györ, 1787) and <hi

                    mentioned John Endrödy, Caspar Göböl, Joseph Takacs, and Barbara Molnar, the
                    earliest distinguished Magyar poetess.</p>
                <p>Of a more general character, and combining the merits of the above schools, are
                    the works of the authors who constituted the so-called “Debreczen Class,” which
                    boasts the names of the naturalist and philologist John Földi, compiler of a
                    considerable part of the <hi rend="italic">Debreczeni</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >magyar</hi><hi rend="italic">grammatica</hi>; Michael Fazekas, author of <hi

                    poem, in 4 cantos; and Joseph Kovacs. Other precursors of the modern school were
                    the poet and philologist Francis Verseghy, whose works extend to nearly forty
                    volumes; the gifted didactic prose writer, Joseph Karman; the metrical rhymster,
                    Gideon Raday; the lyric poets, Szentjôbi Szabo, John Bacsànyi, and the
                    short-lived Gabriel Dayka, whose posthumous “Verses” were published in 1813 by
                    Kazinczy. Still more celebrated were Michael Csokonai and Alexander Kisfaludy.
                    The former is one of the most original and genial of poets, his style somewhat
                    resembling that of Petöfi. The best edition of Csokonai’s works was published by
                    Toldy (Pest, 1844). The first volume of Alexander Kisfaludy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Himfy,</hi> a series of short lyrics of a descriptive and reflective nature,
                    appeared at Buda in 1801, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Kesergδ
                    szerelcm</hi> (Unhappy Love), and was received with such applause as but few
                    books have ever met with; nor was the success of the second volume <hi
                    rend="italic">Boldog szerelcm</hi> (Happy Love), which appeared in 1807,
                    inferior. The-‰7⅛ or “Tales of the Past,” were published at Buda from 1807 to
                    1808, and still further increased Kisfaludy’s fame; but in his dramatic works he
                    was not equally successful. Journalistic literature in the native language
                    begins with the <hi rend="italic">Magyar Hirmond6</hi> (Harbinger) started by
                    Matthias Rath at Pozsony in 1780. Among the magazines the most important was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Magyar</hi><hi rend="italic">Muzeum,</hi> established at Kassa
                    (Kaschau) in 1788 by Barôti, Kazinczy, and Bacsànyi. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orpheus</hi> (1790) was the special work of Kazinczy, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urania</hi> (1794) of Karman and of Pajor.</p>
                <p>Closely connected with the preceding period is that of the “Revival of the
                    Language” (1807-1830), with which the name of Francis Kazinczy is especially
                    associated. To him it was left to perfect that work of restoration begun by
                    Barôti and amplified by Rêvai. Poetry and belles lettres still continued to
                    occupy the chief place in the native literature, but under Kazinczy and his
                    immediate followers Berzsenyi, Kölcsey, Fay, and others, a correctness of style
                    and excellence of taste hitherto unknown soon became apparent. Kazinczy, in his
                    efforts to accommodate the national language to the demands of an improved
                    civilization, availed himself of the treasures of European literature, but
                    thereby incurred the opposition of those who were prejudiced by a too biased
                    feeling of nationality. The opinions of his enemies were ventilated in a lampoon
                    styled <hi rend="italic">Mondolat.</hi> His bellelettristic works, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Szép</hi><hi rend="italic">Litcratura</hi> (Pest, 1814-16), extend
                    to 9 vols., consisting in great part of translations. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >EredetiMukai</hi> (Original Works), in 5 vols., appeared at Pest in 1836-45,
                    under the joint editorship of Bajza and Toldy. Daniel Berzsenyi, whose odes are
                    among the finest in the Hungarian language, was the correspondent of Kazinczy,
                    and like him a victim of the attacks of the <hi rend="italic">Mondolat.</hi> But
                    the fervent patriotism, elevated style, and glowing diction of Berzsenyi soon
                    caused him to be recognized as a truly national bard. <hi rend="italic">A</hi>
                    too frequent allusion to Greek mythological names is a defect sometimes
                    observable in his writings. His collective works were published at Buda by
                    Döbrentei in 1842. Those of John Kis, the friend of Berzsenyi, cover a wide
                    range of subjects, and comprise, besides original poetry, many translations from
                    the Greek, Latin, French, German, and English, among which last may be mentioned
                    renderings from Blair, Pope, and Thomson, and notably his translation, published
                    at Vienna in 1791, of Lowth’s “Choice of Hercules.” The style of Kis is
                    unaffected and easy. As a sonnet writer none stands higher than Paul Szemere,
                    known also for his rendering of Körner’s drama <hi rend="italic">Zrinyi</hi>
                    (1818), and his contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Elct</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">és</hi><hi rend="italic">Litcratura</hi> (Life and Literature).
                    The articles of Francis Kölcsey in the same periodical are among the finest
                    specimens of Hungarian aesthetical criticism. The lyric poems of Kölcsey can
                    hardly be surpassed, whilst his orations, and markedly the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emlék beszéd</hi><hi rend="italic">Kazinczy fclett</hi> (Commemorative Speech
                    on Kazinczy), exhibit not only his own powers, but the singular excellence of
                    the Magyar language as an oratorical medium. Andrew Fay, sometimes styled the
                    “Hungarian Aesop,” was an industrious writer in almost every branch of
                    literature during both this and the following period, but is now chiefly
                    remembered for his <hi rend="italic">Eredeti Mesek</hi> (Original Fables). The
                    dramatic works of Charles Kisfaludy, brother of Alexander, won him enthusiastic
                    recognition as a regenerator of the drama. His plays, moreover, bear a
                    distinctive national character, the subjects of most of them referring to the
                    golden era of the country. His genuine simplicity as a lyrical writer is shown
                    by the fact that several of his shorter pieces have passed into popular song. As
                    the earliest Magyarizer of Servian folk-song, Michael Vitkovics did valuable
                    service. Not without interest to Englishmen is the name of Gabriel Döbrentei,
                    the translator of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” represented at Pozsony in 1825, and
                    of Sterne’s “Letters from Yorick to Eliza,” <hi rend="italic">Yorick</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">és</hi><hi rend="italic">Eliza leυelci</hi> (Pest, 1828). But his
                    chief merit in the eyes of his fellow-countrymen were his editorship of the
                    Kolozsvar <hi rend="italic">Erdélyi</hi><hi rend="italic">Muzeum</hi> (1814-18,
                    vol. x.), and his laborious compilation of the <hi rend="italic">Régi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Magyar</hi><hi rend="italic">Nyelvemlékek</hi> (Memorials of the
                    Magyar Language), which works are among the most important contributions to the
                    literary history of the nation. An historical poem of a somewhat philosophical
                    nature was produced in 1814 by Andreas Horvath under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Zircz</hi><hi rend="italic">emlékezete</hi> (Reminiscence
                    of,Zircz); but his <hi rend="italic">Arpdd,</hi> in 12 books, finished in 1830,
                    and published' at Pest in the following year, is a great national epic. Among
                    other poets of this period were Alois Szentmiklôssy, George Gaal, Emil Buczy,
                    Joseph Szàsz, Ladislaus Toth, and Joseph Katona, author of the much-extolled

                    works on philosophy, we find Samuel Köteles, John Imre, Joseph Ruszek, Daniel
                    Ercsei, and Paul Sàrvàri; as a theologian and Hebraist John Somossy; as an
                    historian and philologist Stephen Horvath, who endeavoured to trace the Magyar

                    nursed by the academy, developed rapidly, and showed its capacity for giving

                    original dramatic productions, the academy provided that the national theatre
                    should not suffer from a lack of classical dramas. During the earlier part of
                    its, existence the Hungarian academy devoted itself mainly to the scientific
                    development of the language and philological research. Since its reorganization
                    in 1869 the academy has, however, paid equal attention to the various
                    departments of history, archaeology, national economy, and the physical
                    sciences. The encouragement of polite literature was more especially the object

                    but after the formation of the academy and the Kisfaludy society it advanced
                    with accelerated speed towards the point attained by other nations. Foremost
                    among epic poets, though not equally successful as a dramatist, was Michael
                    Vörösmarty, who, belonging also to the close of the last period, combines great
                    power of imagination with elegance of language. His historical tragedy <hi
                    rend="italic">Salamon Kirdly</hi> (King Solomon, 1821), though deficient in
                    dramatic force, attracted considerable attention. As fine specimens of epic
                    poetry the <hi rend="italic">Zaldn futdsa</hi> (Flight of Zalan, 1824) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cserhalom</hi> (1826) are unrivalled. His lyrical poems are
                    exquisite both in taste and style; his <hi rend="italic">Sz6zat</hi> (Appeal) is
                    the Magyar national anthem. Vörösmarty is also celebrated as the translator of
                    Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” and “King Lear.” Generally less varied and
                    romantic, though easier in style, are the heroic poems <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aιιgsburgi</hi><hi rend="italic">ütközet</hi> (Battle of Augsburg) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aradi</hi><hi rend="italic">gyülés</hi> (Diet of Arad) of Gregory
                    Czuczor, who was, moreover, very felicitous as an epigrammatist. Martin
                    Debreczeni was chiefly famed for his <hi rend="italic">Ki6vi csata</hi> (Battle
                    of Kieff), published at Pest in 1854 after his death by Count Emeric Miko. The
                    laborious John Garay in his <hi rend="italic">Szent</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ldszlô</hi> shows considerable ability as an epic poet, but his greatest merit
                    was rather as a romancist and ballad writer, as shown by the “Pen Sketches” or
                    <hi rend="italic">Tollrajzok</hi> (1845), and his legendary series <hi
                    rend="italic">Àrpddok</hi> (1847). Joseph Bajza was a lyricist of a somewhat
                    melancholy cast, but his <hi rend="italic">Borének</hi> (Wine Song), <hi
                    rend="italic">Sohajtds</hi> (Sigh), <hi rend="italic">Ébresztü</hi> (Awakening),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Apotheosis</hi> are much admired. He is known further as
                    the translator of F. C. Dahlmann’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der
                    englischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Revolution.</hi> As generally able writers of
                    lyrical poetry during the earlier part of this period may be mentioned among
                    others Francis Csaszar, Joseph Székâcs, and Andrew Kunoss,—also Lewis Szakâl and
                    Alexander Vachott, whose songs and romances are of an artless and simple
                    character, and the sacred lyricist Béla Târkânyi. As an original but rather
                    heavy lyric and didactic poet we may mention Peter Vajda, who was, moreover, the
                    translator of Bulwer’s “Night and Morning.” Of a more distinctly national
                    tendency are the lyrics of John Kriza<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Late Unitarian bishop of Transylvania, author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vadr6z&gt;dk,</hi> or “Wild-Roses” (1863), a collection of Szekler
                    folk-songs, ballads, and sayings.</p></note> and John Erdélyi, but the
                    reputation of the latter was more especially due to his collections of folk-lore
                    made on behalf of the Kisfaludy society. More popular than any of the preceding,
                    and well-known in England through Sir John Bowring’s translation, are the
                    charming lyrics of Alexander Petöfi, the <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> ‘ Burns”
                    of Hungary. His poems, embodying as they do the national genius, have passed
                    into the very life of the people; particularly is he happy in the pieces
                    descriptive of rural life. In his verse “Folk-tales,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Népregék</hi> (1846), and “Ballads,” <hi rend="italic">Regék</hi> (1852), may
                    Michael Tompa, another popular poet, be regarded as sometimes hardly less
                    felicitous. The most diversely gifted Magyar singer, however, is John Arany,
                    whose talents have been displayed, not only in ballads and lyrical effusions,
                    but in almost every branch of poetry except the dramatic. Especially famous is
                    the Toldi trilogy, of which the first part <hi rend="italic">Toldi,</hi> in 12
                    cantos, relating to the youth of the hero, was published at Pest in 1847; the
                    third part, <hi rend="italic">Toldi</hi><hi rend="italic">Estéje</hi> (Toldi’s
                    Eve), describing his fall and death, in 1854; and the middle part, <hi
                    rend="italic">Toldi Szerelme</hi> (Toldi’s Love), in 1879. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nagyidai ezigdnyok</hi> (Eida Gipsies), a fine humorous epic poem in 4 cantos,
                    appeared in 1852. A collective edition of Arany’s poetical works was published
                    at Pest and Vienna in 1867.</p>
                <p>Among recent lyricists who have attracted attention are the following :—Coloman
                    Toth, who is also the author of several epic and dramatic pieces; John Vajda,
                    whose <hi rend="italic">Kisebb</hi><hi rend="italic">Koltemények</hi> (Minor
                    Poems), published by the Kisfaludy society in 1872, are partly written in the
                    mode of Heine, and are of a pleasing but melancholy character; Joseph Lévay,
                    known also as the translator of Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Titus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Andronicus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Taming of the Shrew,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Henry IV.</hi>; and Paul Gyulai, who, not only as a faultless
                    lyric and epic poet, but as an impartial critical writer, is highly esteemed,
                    and whose <hi rend="italic">Romhdnyi</hi> is justly prized as one of the best
                    Magyar poems that has appeared in modern times. To the above may be added the
                    names of Charles Berecz, Joseph Zalar, Samuel Nyilas, Joseph Vida, Lewis Tolnai,
                    the sentimental Ladislaus Szelestey, and the talented painter Zoltan Balogh,
                    whose romantic poem <hi rend="italic">Alpdri</hi> was published in 1871 by the
                    Kisfaludy society. The lyrics of Anthony Vârady (1875, 1877) are somewhat dull
                    and unequal in tone; both he and Baron Ivor Kaas, author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Az</hi><hi rend="italic">itélet</hi><hi rend="italic">napja</hi> (Day of
                    Judgment, 1876), have shown skill rather in the art of dramatic verse. The poems
                    of Count Géza Zichy and Victor Dalmady, those of the latter published at
                    Budapest in 1876, are mostly written on subjects of a domestic nature, but are
                    conceived in a patriotic spirit. Emil Abrânyi adopts a rather romantic style,
                    but his <hi rend="italic">Nagy</hi><hi rend="italic">péntek</hi> (Good Friday)
                    is an excellent descriptive sketch. Alexander Endrödy, author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tι'ιcs'6k dalok</hi> (Cricket Songs, 1876), is a glowing writer,
                    with great power of conception, but his metaphors, following rapidly one upon
                    the other, become often confused. Joseph Kiss in 1876 brought out a few lyric
                    and epic poems of considerable merit. The <hi rend="italic">Mcsék</hi> of
                    Augustus Greguss (1878), a collection of verse “Fables,” belonging to the school
                    of Gay, partake more of a didactic than lyrical nature. This feature is
                    noticeable also in the <hi rend="italic">Koltemények</hi> (1873) of Ladislaus
                    Torkos, and the <hi rend="italic">Modern</hi><hi rend="italic">Mesék</hi> (1874)
                    of Ladislaus Nevy. An energetic satirical poet has recently appeared in Lewis
                    Bartok.</p>
                <p>As one of the latest remarkable productions of Magyar poetry, we must not omit to
                    draw attention to the <hi rend="italic">Salamon</hi> (1878) of Charles Szâsz,
                    which poem was rewarded with the prize of the academy. The subject, taken from
                    the age of Hungarian chivalry, is artistically worked out from mediaeval
                    legends, and gives an excellent description of the times of St Ladislaus of
                    Hungary. Charles Szâsz is generally better known as a metrical translator than
                    as an original poet. He is the Magyarizer of Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthony and Cleopatra, Othello, Macbeth, Henry VIII., Winter's Tale, Romeo and
                    Juliet,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tempest,</hi> as also of some of the best
                    pieces of Burns, Moore, Byron, Shelley, Milton, Béranger, Lamartine, Victor
                    Hugo, Goethe, and others. A translator from Byron and Pope appeared also in
                    Maurice Lukâcs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Besides

                    are interesting from an ethnographical point of view. Versions from the English

                <p>Meanwhile dramatic literature has found many champions, of whom the most
                    energetic is the late Edward Szigligeti, <hi rend="italic">proprie</hi> Joseph
                    Szathmâry, who has enriched the Hungarian stage with more than a hundred pieces.
                    Of these the most popular are comedies and serio-comic national dramas. His
                    recently produced tragedy <hi rend="italic">Béla</hi><hi rend="italic">IV.</hi>
                    is also much admired. A less prolific but more classical writer appeared in
                    Charles Obernyik, whose <hi rend="italic">George Brankovics</hi> is, next to
                    Katona’s <hi rend="italic">Bdnk Bdn,</hi> one of the best historical tragedies
                    in the language. Several of the already mentioned lyric and epic poets were, as
                    we have shown in the case of Vörösmarty, occasional writers also for the drama.
                    To these we may add the gifted but unfortunate Sigismund Czakô, Lewis Dobsa,
                    Joseph Szigeti, Ignatius Nagy, Joseph Szenvey (a translator from Schiller),
                    Joseph Gaal, Charles Hugo, Lawrence Toth (the Magyarizer of the <hi

                    famous as a novelist), Stephen Toldy, and Lewis Doczi, author of the popular

                    poem of a philosophical and contemplative character, and is not intended for the
                    stage. Among the latest most successful dramatic pieces may be mentioned the <hi
                    rend="italic">Falu rossza</hi> (Village Scamp) of the late Edward T6th (1875),
                    which represents the life of the Hungarian peasantry, and shows both Eoetic
                    sentiment and dramatic skill; <hi rend="italic">A szerelem harcza</hi> (Combat
                    of ove), by Count Géza Zichy; <hi rend="italic">Iskdriot</hi> (1876) and the

                    Maurice Jôkai (1877). The principal merit of this author’s drama <hi

                    although in some parts exquisitely worded, did not meet with the applause

                    of comedy we single out Arpad Berczik for his <hi rend="italic">A hdzasitôk</hi>

                    by Joseph Bajza to 1837. Almost simultaneously with the rise of the Kisfaludy
                    society, works of fiction assumed a more vigorous tone, and began to present
                    just claims for literary recognition. Far from adopting the levity of style too
                    often observable in French romances, the Magyar novels, although enlivened by
                    touches of humour, have generally rather a serious historical or political
                    bearing. Especially is this the case with Nicholas Josika’s <hi rend="italic"

                    Bohemians in Hungary), and <hi rend="italic">Az</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >utolsô</hi><hi rend="italic">Bdtori</hi> (The Last of the Bâthoris), published
                    in 1847. In these, as in many other of the romances of J6sika, a high moral
                    standard is aimed at. The same may be said of Baron Joseph Eotvos’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Karthausi</hi> (1839), and <hi rend="italic">Falu Jegyzδje</hi>
                    (Village Notary), published in 1845, and translated into English (1850) by 0.
                    Wenckstern (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Eötvös,</hi> vol. viii. p. 455). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Àrvizk'ônyv</hi> or “Inundation Book,” edited by Eötvös, 1839-41,
                    is a collection of narratives and poems by the most celebrated authors of the
                    time. Of the novels produced by Baron Sigismond Kemény the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gyulai Pal</hi> (1847), in 5 vols., is, from its historical character, the most
                    im-f&gt;ortant. His <hi rend="italic">Férj és</hi><hi rend="italic">nö</hi>
                    (Husband and Wife) appeared in 1853 latest ed., 1878), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bajong6k</hi> (Fanatics), in 4 vols., in 1858-59.</p>
                <p>The graphic descriptions of Hungarian life in the middle and lower classes by
                    Lewis Kuthy won for him temporary renown; but his style, though flowery, is
                    careless. Another popular writer of great originality was Joseph Radâkovics <hi
                    rend="italic">alias</hi> Vas-Gereben. The romances of Baron Frederick
                    Podιnaniczky are simpler, and rather of a narrative than colloquial character.
                    The fertile writer Paul Kovacs excels more particularly in humorous narration.
                    Fay’s singular powers in this direction were well shown by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >JAvor orvos</hi><hi rend="italic">és</hi><hi rend="italic">Bakator Ambrus
                    szolgdja</hi> (Doctor Jâvor and his servant Ambrose Bakator), brought out at
                    Pest in 1855. The <hi rend="italic">Beszélyek</hi> (Tales) of Ladislaus Beöthy
                    were produced in the same year, his <hi rend="italic">Pusztdk Jia</hi> (Son of
                    the Pusztas) in 1857. Pleasing humorous sketches are contained also in Ignatius
                    Nagy’s <hi rend="italic">Beszélyek</hi> (1843) and “Caricatures” or <hi
                    rend="italic">Torzképek</hi> (1844); in Caspar Bernât’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fresko</hi><hi rend="italic">képek</hi> (1847-50); in Gustavus Lauka’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Vidék,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">A jô régi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vilAg</hi> (The Good Old World), published respectively in 1857
                    and 1863; and in Alexander-Balazs’s <hi rend="italic">Beszélyei</hi> (1855) and
                    <hi rend="italic">Tük'ôrdarabok</hi> (1865). Among authors of other historical
                    or humorous romances and tales which have appeared from time to time are Francis
                    Marton <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Lewis Abonyi, Joseph Gaal, Paul Gyulai,
                    William Györi, Lazarus Horvath, the short-lived Joseph Irinyi, translator of
                    “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” Francis Ney, Albert Palffy, Alexander Vachott and his
                    brother Emeric (Vahot), Charles Szathmary, Desider Margittay, Victor Vajda,
                    Joseph Bodon, Atala Kisfaludy, John Kratky, and the several writers whose names
                    and latest works are noticed at the end of this paragraph. But by far the most
                    prolific and talented novelist that Hungary can boast of is Maurice Jokai, whose
                    power of imagination and brilliancy of style, no less than his true
                    representations of Hungarian life and character, have earned for him a European
                    reputation. His earlier romances, published before the revolution of 1848, are
                    chiefly of a social or political tendency. Of his more recent productions the
                    best known are <hi rend="italic">Egy</hi><hi rend="italic">magyar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ndbob</hi> (A Magyar Nabob), with its continuation <hi
                    rend="italic">Kdrρdthy Zoltdn,</hi> published in 1853 and 1854 respectively; <hi

                    >Az</hi><hi rend="italic">élet komédidsai</hi> (The Comedians of Life, 1876);
                    the historical romance <hi rend="italic">Szép</hi><hi rend="italic">Mikhdl</hi>
                    (1876) already referred to; and his justly admired and vividly interesting work
                    <hi rend="italic">Egy az isten,</hi> (God is One, 1877). The events of the
                    last-mentioned novel, in which the Unitarians play an important part, are
                    supposed to take place between the years 1848 and 1859, and the scenes are laid
                    partly in Transylvania, partly in Italy. In his <hi rend="italic">A
                    névtelen</hi><hi rend="italic">wir</hi> (Nameless Castle, 1878), the author
                    connects an epoch of French history with Hungarian, and gives an account of the
                    Hungarian army employed so unsuccessfully against Napoleon in 1809. <hi
                    rend="italic">Bab Rdby</hi> (Captive Raby), produced in 1879, is a tale of the
                    times of Joseph II. Defects occasionally observable in Jokai’s works are want of
                    unity, consistency, and probability. Of the novels produced by other authors
                    since 1870, we may mention <hi rend="italic">A hoi az ember</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">kezdödik</hi> (Where the Man Begins), by Edward Kavassy (1871), in

                    Hungarian provincial life, by Zoltân Beöthy, a pleasing writer who possesses a

                    (1877), the tale is made the medium for a satirical attack upon official
                    corruption and Hungarian national vanity; and' in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almolc</hi><hi rend="italic">dlmodôja</hi> (Dreamer of Dreams), by John Asboth
                    (1878), other national defects are aimed at. <hi rend="italic">A rosz</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">szomszéd</hi> (The Bad Neighbour), by Charles Vadnay (1878), is a
                    felicitous representation of the power of love. The <hi rend="italic">Az</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">utolsô</hi><hi rend="italic">Bebck</hi> (The Last of the Bebeks),
                    by the late Charles Pétery, is a work rich in poetic invention, but meagre in
                    historical matter. The reverse is the case with, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lajos</hi><hi rend="italic">pap</hi> (Priest Lewis), by Charles Vajkay (1879),
                    the scene of which is placed at Pest, in the beginning of the 14th century. In
                    this romance the interest of the narrative is weakened by a superabundance of
                    historical and archaeological detail.</p>
                <p>As regards works of a scientific character, the Magyars until recently were
                    confessedly behind hand as compared with many other European nations. Indeed,
                    before the foundation of the Hungarian academy in 1830, but few such works
                    claiming general recognition had been published in the native language. Even in
                    1847 astronomy, physics, logic, and other subjects of the kind had to be taught
                    in several of the lyceums through the medium of Latin. The violent political
                    commotions of the next few years allowed but little opportunity for the
                    prosecution of serious studies; the subsequent quieter state of the country, and
                    gradual re-establishment of the language as a means of education, were, however,
                    more favourable to the development of scientific knowledge.</p>
                <p>In the department of philosophy, besides several writers of dissertations bearing
                    an imitative, didactic, or polemical character, Hungary can boast a few authors
                    of independent and original thought. Of these one of the most notable is Cyril
                    Horvath, whose treatises published in the organs of the academy display a rare
                    freedom and comprehensiveness of imagination. John Hetényi and Gustavus Szontagh
                    must be rather regarded as adopters and developers of the ethical teaching of
                    Samuel Köteles in the previous period. Hyacinth Ronay in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >MutatvAny</hi> (Representation) and <hi rend="italic">Jellemisme</hi>
                    (Characteristics) endeavoured to popularize psychological studies. The
                    philosophical labours of the already mentioned John Erdélyi and of Augustus
                    Greguss won for them λvell-deserved recognition, the latter especially being
                    famous for his aesthetical productions, in which he appears to follow out the
                    principles of Vischer. The <hi rend="italic">TanulmAnyok</hi> (Studies) of
                    Greguss were brought out at Pest in 1872. The reputation of John Szilasy, John
                    Varga, Fidelius Beély, and Francis Ney arose rather from their works bearing on
                    the subject of education than from their contributions to philosophy.</p>
                <p>The labours of Stephen Horvath in the preceding period had prepared the way for
                    future workers in the field of historical literature. Specially meritorious
                    among these are Michael Horvath, Ladislaus Szalay, Paul Jâszay, and Count Joseph
                    Teleki. The <hi rend="italic">Magyarok</hi><hi rend="italic">t'ôrténete</hi>
                    (History of the Magyars), in 4 vols., first published at Papa (1842-46), and
                    afterwards in 6 vols, at Pest (1860-63), and in 8 vols. (1871—73), is the most
                    famous of Michael Horvath’s numerous historical productions. Ladislaus Szalay’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Magyarorszdg</hi><hi rend="italic">t'ôrténete</hi> (History of
                    Hungary), vols. L-iv. (Leipsic, 1852-54), vols, v.-vi. (Pest, 1856-61), second
                    edition, i.-v. (1861-66), is a most comprehensive work) showing more
                    particularly the progress of Hungarian legislative development in past times.
                    His style is elevated and concise, but somewhat difficult. Magyar history is
                    indebted to Paul Jâszay for his careful working out of certain special periods,
                    as, for instance, in his <hi rend="italic">A Magyar nemzet napjai</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a legrégibb</hi><hi rend="italic">idötöl</hi><hi rend="italic">az
                    arany bulldig</hi> (Days of the Hungarian nation from the earliest times to the
                    date of the Golden Bull). Count Joseph Teleki is famed chiefly for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Hunyadiak kora MagyarorszAgon</hi> (The Times of the Hunyadys in
                    Hungary), vols, i.-vi. (Pest, 1852-63), x.-xii. (1853— 57), the result of thirty
                    years’ labour and research. In particular departments of historical literature
                    we find George Bartal, author of <hi rend="italic">Commentariorum</hi><hi

                    Hungarian revolution of 1848-49; Charles Ldnyi and John Pauer, authors of

                    historians of Magyar literature Francis Toldy <hi rend="italic">alias</hi>
                    Schedel holds the foremost place. As compilers of useful manuals may be
                    mentioned also Joseph Szvorényi, Zoltan Beöthy, Alexander Imre, Paul Jâmbor,
                    Ladislaus Névy, John Környei, and Joseph Szinnyei, junior. For philological and
                    ethnographical research into the origin and growth of the language none excels
                    Paul Hunfalvy. He is, moreover, the warm advocate of the theory of its
                    Ugrio-Finnic origin, as established by the late Uralian traveller Anthony
                    Reguly, the result of whose labours Hunfalvy published in 1864, under the title
                    <hi rend="italic">A Vogul fold</hi><hi rend="italic">és nép</hi> (The Vogul Land
                    and People). Between 1862 and 1866 valuable philological studies bearing on the

                    history and its allied branches, owing to the direct encouragement given by the
                    Hungarian Historical Society, and by the historical, archaeological, and
                    statistical committees of the academy.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the exertions of Paul Bugât to arouse an interest in the natural
                    sciences by the establishment in 1841 of the “Hungarian Royal Natural Science
                    Association,” no general activity was manifested in this department of
                    knowledge, so far as the native literature was concerned, until 1860, when the
                    academy organized a special committee for the advancement of mathematical and
                    natural science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See,

                    Thanhoffer; for zoology, John Frivaldszky, John Kriesch, and Theodore Margo; for

                    awarded by the academy, we may mention the <hi rend="italic">Természettan</hi>

                <p>Almost simultaneously with the formation of the above-mentioned committee of the
                    academy, the “Natural Science Association”</p>
                <p>showed signs of renewed animation, and soon advanced with rapid strides in the
                    same direction, but with a more popular aim than the academy. This may be seen
                    from the fact that between 1868 and 1878 the number of its members increased
                    from some 600 to about 5000. Since 1872, in addition to its regular organs, it
                    has issued Hungarian translations of several popular scientific English works,
                    as, for instance, Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi>; Huxley’s

                <p>In order to give a general idea of the dominant position that the native
                    Hungarian literature has obtained during the last half century, we conclude our
                    sketch with a few statistics of the number of books and periodicals issued from
                    the press at various dates since the foundation of the academy. In the year 1831
                    there were 184 Magyar works published; in 1853 there were 336; this number in
                    1874 increased to 946; in 1877 to 1067; and in 1878 and 1879 to 1312 and 1154
                    respectively. In 1879 there appeared also 111 German works, and 185 in other
                    non-Magyar languages. In 1830 the number of Magyar periodicals was 10; in
                    1848-49 it increased to 80, but fell in 1850 to 9. In 1867, after the
                    restoration of the Hungarian constitution, the number was again 80, and
                    increased so rapidly during the next twelve years that by 1879 it reached 324,
                    and has in the present year (1880) risen to 368. There are now, moreover, 197
                    newspapers and journals of all kinds in the nonMagyar languages, viz., 114
                    German, 61 Slavonic, 16 Roumanian, 4 Italian, and 2 Hebrew; so that there are at
                    this date altogether 565 periodicals published in Hungary.</p>
                <p>If we take a retrospective glance at the depressed state of the native language
                    and literature as it was a century ago, when the first Magyar newspaper was
                    published at Pozsony, 1st January 1780,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A Latin periodical, intended only for transmission abroad,

                    was first published in Hungary about 1731.</p></note> and contrast its
                    commanding position now,—or if we consider that, though constantly surrounded
                    and pressed by foreign and antagonistic elements, the native language and
                    literature have not only not been overpowered, but have even gained the mastery,
                    —we cannot fail to admire the determined perseverance of the champions of Magyar
                    literature, and believe that the state language is destined to be a common and
                    enduring bond of union between the various nationalities comprised under the
                    crown of St Stephen.</p>
