                    >Hortensia,</hi> a low deciduous shrub, producing rather large oval
                    strongly-veined leaves in opposite pairs along the stem. It is terminated by a
                    massive globular corymbose head of flowers, which remain a long period in an
                    ornamental condition. The normal colour of the flowers, the majority of which
                    have neither stamens nor pistil, is pink; but by the influence of sundry agents
                    in the soil, such as alum or iron, they become changed to blue. The part of the
                    inflorescence which appears to be the flower is an exaggerated expansion of the
                    calyx-leaves, the other parts being generally abortive. The perfect flowers are
                    small, rarely produced in the species above referred to, but well illustrated by
                    others, in which they occupy the inner parts of the corymb, the larger showy
                    neuter flowers being produced at the circumference. A pure white variety, named
                    Thomas Hogg, has been recently introduced, and is a very desirable plant.</p>
                <p>There are upwards of thirty species, found chiefly in Japan, in the mountains of
                    India, and in North America, and many of them are familiar in gardens, <hi
                    rend="italic">H. Hortensia</hi> is the most useful for decoration, as the head
                    of flowers lasts long in a fresh state, and by the aid of forcing can behad for
                    a considerable period for the ornamentation of the greenhouse and conservatory.
                    Their natural flowering season is towards the end of the summer, but they may be
                    had earlier by means of forcing. <hi rend="italic">H. japonica</hi> is another
                    fine conservatory plant, with foliage and habit much resembling the last-named,
                    but this has flat corymbs of flowers, the central ones small and perfect, and
                    the outer ones only enlarged and neuter. This also produces pink or blue flowers
                    under the influence of different soils.</p>
                <p>The Japanese species of hydrangea are sufficiently hardy to grow in any tolerably
                    favourable situation, but except in the most sheltered localities they seldom
                    blossom to any degree of perfection in the open air, the head of blossom
                    depending on the uninjured development of a well-ripened terminal bud, and this
                    growth being frequently affected by lite spring frosts. They are much more
                    useful for potculture indoors, and should be reared from cuttings of shoots
                    having the terminal bud plump and prominent, put in during summer, these
                    developing a single head of flowers the succeeding summer. Somewhat larger
                    plants may be had by nipping out the terminal bud and inducing three or four
                    shoots to start in its place, and these, being steadily developed and
                    well-ripened, should each yield its inflorescence in the following summer, that
                    is, when two years old. Large plants grown in tubs and vases are fine subjects
                    for large conservatories, and may be used for decorating terrace walks and
                    similar places during summer, being housed in winter, and started under glass in
                    spring.</p>
                <p>The Indian and American species, especially the latter, are quite hardy, and some
                    of them are extremely effective. The finest of these by far is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora,</hi> the branched inflorescence
                    of which is under favourable circumstances a yard or more in length, and
                    consists of large spreading masses of crowded white neuter flowers which
                    completely conceal the few inconspicuous fertile ones. The plant attains a
                    height of 8 to 10 feet, and when in flower late in summer and in autumn is a
                    very attractive object in the shrubbery.</p>
