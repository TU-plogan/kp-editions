                    lieutenantgovernorship of the Punjab, India, lying between 30° 58' and 32° 5' N.
                    lat. and between 75° 31' and 76° 4Γ 15'' E. long. It forms the central district
                    of the Jalandhar division, and is bounded N.E. by the district of Kângra and the
                    native state of Nâlagarh, N. and N.W. by the river Bias, S,W. by Jalandhar, and
                    S. by the river Satlaj (Sutlej) and Ambâla (Umballa) district.</p>
                <p>The district of Hushiârpur falls into two nearly equal portions of hill and plain
                    country. Its eastern face consists of the westward slope of the Kângra
                    Mountains; parallel with that ridge, a line of lower heights traverses the
                    district from south to north, while between the two chains stretches a valley of
                    uneven width, known as the Jaswân Dùn. Its upper portion is crossed by the Soân
                    torrent, while the Sutlej sweeps into its lower end by a break in the hills, and
                    flows in a southerly direction till it turns the flank of the central range, and
                    debouches westwards upon the plains. This western plain consists of alluvial
                    formation, with a general westerly slope owing to the deposit of silt from the
                    mountain torrents in the submontane tract. The Bias has a fringe of lowland,
                    open to moderate but not excessive inundations, and considered very fertile. A
                    considerable area is covered by Government woodlands, under the care of the
                    forest department.</p>

                <p>Tħe census of 1868 was taken over an area of 2086 square miles, an 1 showed a
                    total population of 938,890 (males, 504,393; females, 434,497). Of these, the
                    Hindus numbered 415,471; Mahometans, 317,967; Sikhs, 79,417; and “others,”
                    126,035. The district contained nine municipalities in 1875-76,
                    namely,—Hushiârpur (see below), Urmar Tanda (13,970), Mukerian(5116), Dasuya
                    (8677), Anandpur (6405), Hariâna (7802), Garhdiwala (3874), Una (4908), and
                    Mi&lt;ini (Meeanee) (7942). The total imperial revenue in 1872-73 was £148,708;
                    the local revenue for expenditure on works of public utility, £14,856. Fifteen
                    civil and revenue judges exercised jurisdiction in the district. There were 321
                    schools, with 7066 pupils, receiving £2291 from the public funds.</p>
                <p>The cultivated area in 1868 amounted to 751,707 acres, out of an assessed total
                    of 1,335,245. Rice is largely grown, owing to the abundance of marshy flats
                    along the banks of the Bias. The other products are wheat, barley, gram,
                    tobacco, <hi rend="italic">jodr,</hi> maize, <hi rend="italic">moth, mash,</hi>
                    cotton, and sugar-cane. The state of agricultural knowledge is very backward,
                    and implements are of the simplest description. Only 17,836 acres are under
                    irrigation, chiefly from an old canal in the northern corner. The trade of
                    Hushiarpur is confined to its raw material, including grain, sugar, hemp,
                    safflower, fibres, tobacco, indigo, and cotton; of these, sugar forms by far the
                    most important commercial item. The manufactures are of no importance. Several
                    religious fairs are held, at Anandpur, Mukeriân, and Achintpurni, all of which
                    attract an enormous concourse of people. The Jalandhar and Kângra road forms the
                    chief route; and good roads connect Hushiârpur and other centres with the
                    neighbouring towns. The district, owing to its proximity to the hills, possesses
                    a comparatively cool and humid climate. Malarious fever, cholera, and bowel
                    complaints are the prevailing illnesses. The annual rainfall in 1871-72 was 32 6
                    inches. There are five charitable dispensaries.</p>
                <p>The country around Hushiârpur formed part of the Katoch kingdom of Jalandhar. The
                    state was eventually broken up, and the present district was divided between the
                    râjâs of Ditârpur and Jaswân. They retained undisturbed possession of their
                    territories until 1759, when the rising Sikh chieftains commenced a series of
                    encroachments upon the hill tracts. In 1815 the aggressive mahârâjâ, Ranjit
                    Sinh, forced the ruler of Jaswân to resign his territories in exchange for an
                    estate on feudal tenure; three years later the râjâ of Ditârpur met with similar
                    treatment. By the close of the year 1818 the whole country from the Sutlej to
                    the Bias had come under the Government of Lahore, and after the first Sikh war
                    in 1846 passed into the hands of the English Government. The deposed râjâs of
                    Ditârpur and Jaswân received cash pensions from the new rulers, but expressed
                    bitter disappointment at not being restored to their former sovereign position.
                    Accordingly the outbreak of the Mooltan war, and the revolt of Ciιatthr Sinh in
                    1848, found the disaffected chieftains ready for rebellion. They organized a
                    revolt, but the two râjâs and the other ringleaders were captured, and their
                    estates confiscated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hushiârpur,</hi> municipal town and administrative
                    headquarters of the above district, is situated on the bank of a broad sandy
                    torrent. The population in 1868 numbered 13,022, comprising 6350 Hindus, 6002
                    Mahometans, 119 Sikhs, 62 Christians, and 489 “others.” The town was founded,
                    according to tradition, about the early part of the 14th century. In 1809 it was
                    occupied by Ranjit Sinh. The mahârâjâ and his successors maintained a
                    considerable cantonment one mile south-east of the town, and the British
                    Government kept it up for several years after the annexation. Floods often cause
                    much damage, to guard against which an embankment was raised in 1852. The civil
                    station contains tiιe district court house and treasury, βessions-house, <hi
                    rend="italic">tahHl</hi> and police offices, dispensary, staging bungalow, and
                    <hi rend="italic">sarai.</hi> Both station and town are plentifully wooded, and
                    enjoy a good sanitary reputation. There is a trade in grain, sugar, and
                    tobacco.</p>
