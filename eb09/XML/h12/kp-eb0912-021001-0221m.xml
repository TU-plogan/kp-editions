                    public life, and at the age of nineteen he made his first speech at the bar, and
                    shortly afterwards successfully conducted the defence of a petty king of
                    Bithynia, one of Rome’s many dependants in the East. From that time his
                    reputation as an eloquent advocate was decisively established. As the son-in-law
                    of Catulus he was attached to the aristocratical party of which Sulla was the
                    head, and among his clients he numbered several of its most eminent members.
                    During Sulla’s ascendency the courts of law were Under the control of the
                    senate, the judges being themselves senators. To this circumstance perhaps as
                    well as to his own merits Hortensius may have been indebted for much of his
                    success. Many of his clients were the governors of provinces which they were
                    accused of having plundered, and such men were generally sure to find themselves
                    brought before a somewhat lenient or even friendly tribunal, one, too, which was
                    shamefully accessible to corruption. Hortensius himself, according to Cicero,
                    was not ashamed to avail himself of this disgraceful weakness, and a good deal
                    of the plunder which his clients had got from the provincials went into the
                    pockets of the judges. Cicero made this statement in open court, and we are thus
                    driven to assume that it must have had some foundation.</p>
                <p>Hortensius, like other eminent Roman citizens, passed through the regular
                    succession of public offices, rising from the quaestorship in 81 to the
                    consulship in 69 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In the year before his
                    consulship he came into collision with the now rapidly rising eloquence of
                    Cicero in the memorable case of Verres, and from that time his supremacy at the
                    bar was shaken. In fact his younger rival stepped into his position. Cicero’s
                    success against a man who was backed up by all the influence of Sulla’s party
                    was a splendid triumph, and it must have been a heavy blow to Hortensius.
                    Shortly afterwards he was again pitted against Cicero, and again failed. In 67 a
                    proposal was made to supersede Lucullus in his command in the East against
                    Mithradates in favour of Pompeius. This was supported by Cicero, and was
                    successfully carried in face of the opposition of Hortensius. From the year 63
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the famous year of Cicero’s consulship and of
                    the Catiline conspiracy, we find the two great rivals often associated together
                    as counsel in the same case. The fact was that Cicero was now himself drawn
                    towards the aristocratical party,—the party of Hortensius. Consequently, in the
                    many cases which had more or less of a political complexion as arising out of
                    the disorder and turbulence incident to party quarrels, it was natural that the
                    two men should have the same sympathies and be engaged on the same side. So it
                    happened, for example, in the case of Licinius Murena, whom Cicero defended
                    along with Hortensius against a charge of bribery in canvassing for the
                    consulship. And so strongly declared was his sympathy with Milo against Cicero’s
                    bitter enemy Clodius that he was nearly murdered by some of Clodius’s gang.
                    After Pompeius’s return from the East in 61 B.C., and the political revolution
                    which for a time united him with Caesar, Hortensius withdrew from public life
                    and devoted himself exclusively to his profession. For nine more years he was in
                    continual employment as an advocate, and won a number of verdicts. In 50 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the last year of his life, he defended successfully
                    one Appius Claudius against Dolabella, Cicero’s son-in-law, who prosecuted the
                    man on a serious charge of bribery.</p>
                <p>None of Hortensius’s speeches have come down to us; and it was, it seems, only on
                    special occasions that he wrote them. Almost all our knowledge of him is derived
                    from Cicero. He was undoubtedly a highly-gifted and accomplished man, and though
                    of course he owed his very early success to his great connexions, yet he was
                    perfectly well able to stand on his own conspicuous merits. His eloquence
                    perhaps was not quite of the highest order it was not for the most part what
                    Cicero called “gravis,” weighty, dignified, impressive; there was, it may be
                    presumed, an absence of those appeals to great moral principles which give such
                    grandeur to the best speeches of Cicero and Demosthenes, and of our own Burke.
                    His oratory, according to his great rival, was of the Asiatic style, by which
                    appears to be meant a florid rhetoric, better to hear than to read. He had the
                    gift of a marvellously tenacious memory, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0222-0211"/> could retain every single point in his opponent’s
                    argument. His action was highly artificial, and even his manner of folding his
                    toga was noted by eminent tragic actors of the day, and is left on record by
                    Macrobius. He had, too, a fine musical voice, which he could skilfully
                    command.</p>
                <p>Cicero sometimes speaks of Hortensius very favourably, and even almost
                    affectionately, though it would appear from some passages in his letters that he
                    never quite trusted him. He could not have thought him a high-principled man, as
                    he openly charged him with bribery, and as he actually mentions a case in which
                    he claimed property under a will which he knew to be a forgery (Z&gt;e <hi
                    rend="italic">Officiis,</hi> iii. 18). Hortensius, in fact, seems to have been a
                    lax, easygoing, clever man, with very little noble ambition and very little real
                    moral worth. “An amiable Epicurean” is a phrase which describes him not
                    unfairly. The anecdotes we have about him all point to a man of luxurious tastes
                    and a great capacity for enjoyment. The vast wealth he had accumulated during
                    forty-four years of successful practice he spent after the fashion of rich Roman
                    nobles, in splendid villas, in parks, in fish ponds, and costly entertainments.
                    He left his heir an unusually well-stocked cellar of wine, and his park at
                    Laurentum abounded in every variety of game. He was also a great buyer of
                    pictures and works of art. With true consistency he opposed Pompeius and Crassus
                    when they proposed their sumptuary law. He is said to have spoken wittily on the
                    occasion; he was at any rate successful.</p>
                <p>There is a good account of Hortensius in Dunlop’s <hi rend="italic">Roman
                    Literature</hi> (ii. 222), and in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Greek
                    and Roman Biography</hi> his life and career are traced as thoroughly as the
                    materials at our disposal allow. (W. J. B.)</p>
