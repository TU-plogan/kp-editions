                <p><label type="entry">HOSPITAL</label> is derived from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >hospitalis</hi> (adj.), and this again from the noun <hi rend="italic"
                    >hospes,</hi> a host or guest. The place in which a guest was received was in
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">hospitium</hi> (hence the French, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hospice),</hi> but in course of time the adjective became used as a noun, and
                    the words <hi rend="italic">hospitalis, hospitale,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >hospitalia</hi> were adopted in the same sense as <hi rend="italic"
                    >hospitium,</hi> by dropping the nouns <hi rend="italic">domus, cubiculum,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">cubicula.</hi> In this sense Vitruvius uses <hi
                    rend="italic">hospitalia</hi> to mean the chambers where guests were received.
                    The English word <hi rend="italic">hospital</hi> (often reduced to <hi
                    rend="italic">spital)</hi> comes from the old French <hi rend="italic"
                    >hospital,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">hôpital,</hi> of which Littré says that it
                    was remade from the Latin many centuries ago, although originally <hi
                    rend="italic">hospitalis</hi> had given rise quite regularly to <hi
                    rend="italic">hostel,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">hôtel.</hi> The three words,
                    <hi rend="italic">hôpital,</hi><hi rend="italic">hospice,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">hôtel,</hi> although from the same source, are used now in very
                    different meanings, the first being usually restricted to establishments for
                    temporary occupation by the sick and hurt, for the purposes of medical and
                    surgical treatment; the second <hi rend="italic">(hospice)</hi> to places for
                    permanent occupation by the poor, the infirm, the incurable, or the insane; and
                    the last <hi rend="italic">(hôtel)</hi> to dwellings, either public or private,
                    for ordinary occupation. To the last, however, there is one exception, viz.,
                    when the term <hi rend="italic">hôtel-Dieu,</hi> (that is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hôtel de Dieu)</hi> is applied to the chief hospital or infirmary of a town or
                    city. In English we have no equivalent to <hi rend="italic">hospice,</hi> so
                    that the word <hi rend="italic">hospital</hi> has been, and is still, used in
                    the double sense, viz., as a place for medical treatment, and also as a retreat
                    or almshouse for the poor, the infirm, &amp;c. On the other hand the word <hi
                    rend="italic">infirmary,</hi> which originally meant a place or room set apart
                    in an establishment (such as a monastery) for the reception of the sick members,
                    and also for those who were through age or infirmity incapacitated from work, is
                    not infrequently employed in the same sense as <hi rend="italic">hospitcd,</hi>
                    namely, as a separate establishment for the treatment of the sick.</p>
                <p>Although in ancient times there may have been places for the reception of
                    strangers and travellers, it seems at least doubtful if there was anything of
                    the nature of a charitable institution for the reception of the sick, such as
                    existed after the introduction of Christianity. The Bethesda of Scripture
                    (Aramaic, from ∏'3, a house, and charity) was probably no more than a collection
                    of mere sheds built round the pool to whose waters miraculous healing powers
                    were attributed. Among the Greeks there seems little evidence of the existence
                    of establishments for the sick; <hi rend="italic">ξevωv,</hi> described by Plato
                    as a place of shelter for travellers, is also explained as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >voσo-κoμeiov,</hi> or hospital, by Suidas; but that lexicographer is a late
                    writer (10th or 11th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and the word <hi
                    rend="italic">voσo-κoμ*ιov</hi> itself does not appear to be earlier in use than
                    the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The word is used by St Jerome in
                    the 4th century, and in the Code of Justinian in the 6th, from which it is
                    possible Suidas may have got his definition, although <hi rend="italic"
                    >½evo8oχeιov</hi> is distinctly used by Justinian as a shelter for travellers,
                    as indeed its name implies. Even for sick and wounded soldiers but little
                    provision seems to have been made, although we do not know much of the <hi
                    rend="italic">valetudinarium,</hi> which appears to have existed in a Roman
                    camp. That the Romans had a medical staff has been shown by the monuments
                    discovered in Great Britain, and the subject has been carefully examined by the
                    late Sir James Simpson <hi rend="italic">(Transactions of the Society of
                    Antiquaries of Scotland, Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medicine,</hi> &lt;kc.).
                    Among the earliest hospitals on record are that said to have been founded by
                    Valens in Caesarea 370-80 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the one built at
                    Rome by Fabiola, a Roman lady and friend of St Jerome, although like most others
                    of that and even later times both were probably almshouses as well.</p>
                <p>The origin of our present hospitals must, however, be looked for in the monastic
                    arrangements for the care of the sick and indigent. Every monastery had its <hi
                    rend="italic">infirmaria,</hi> managed by an <hi rend="italic">infirmarius,</hi>
                    in which not only were sick and convalescents treated, but also the aged, the
                    blind, the weak, &lt;fcc., were housed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">Glossary, s.υ.</hi> “Infirmaria.”</p></note> In course of time
                    separate buildings were erected for the purpose, and special revenues, augmented
                    from time to time by benefactions, appropriated for their maintenance. In
                    numerous instances, however, the hospitals were converted into benefices by the
                    priests, and the scandal had to be dealt with by the authority of general
                    councils, which, like that of Vienne, forbade the practice. About the earliest
                    distinct record of the building of a hospital in England is in the life of
                    Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, who in 1080 founded two, one for leprosy and
                    one for ordinary diseases. The former is referred to in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vie de St Thomas</hi><hi rend="italic">le</hi><hi rend="italic">Martyr,</hi> a
                    work of the 12th century. The establishments for the sick remained in the hands
                    of the clergy until the Reformation, when some of the monasteries and church
                    property were appropriated and set apart for the use of the sick. Of those the
                    most noted instances were St Bartholomew’s in Smithfield, St Thomas’s in the
                    Borough, Bethlehem or Bedlam, Bridewell, and Christ’s Hospital, which were long
                    known as the “Five Royal Hospitals.” St Bartholomew’s was a priory, founded by
                    Rahere, a minstrel, in 1102, and the ancient hospital chapel is still the parish
                    church of St Bartholomew the Less. It was handed over to the citizens of London
                    as a hospital in 1547; it escaped the fire of 1666, and was rebuilt in 1729. St
                    Thomas’s was founded by Richard, prior of Bermondsey, in 1213, surrendered in
                    1538, and purchased by the mayor and citizens of London in 1551, and opened for
                    260 sick. It was incorporated in 1553, rebuilt in 1693, added to in 1732,
                    removed temporarily to Surrey Gardens in 1862, and finally transferred to
                    Lambeth, its present site, in 1871. Bethlehem (or Bedlam) was a priory, founded
                    by Simon Fitzmary, in 1247. In 1547 it was handed over by Henry VIII. for the
                    reception of lunatics. It was rebuilt in 1676, and wings were added in 1733. The
                    present building was constructed in 1810. Bridewell and Christ’s Hospital early
                    ceased to be receptacles for the sick. (For further information regarding
                    charitable institutions see <hi rend="smallcaps">England,</hi> vol. viii. p.
                    253.)</p>
                <p>But the great movement in hospital building took place in the 18th century, and

                <p>During the present century the increase of hospitals has continued, seven general
                    and many special having been founded in London alone. Dr Steele gives statistics
                    of 27 metropolitan hospitals, having an aggregate of nearly 6000 beds, and
                    receiving about 46,000 in-patients annually. This does not take into account the
                    infirmaries attached to the workhouses or the metropolitan asylums hospitals. In
                    addition to this probably from ten to twelve times the number of out-patients
                    are treated in the course of the year.</p>
                <p>Hospitals are usually divided into <hi rend="italic">General</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Special.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">General Hospitals</hi> cases of all kinds are admitted in
                    some, whilst in others certain classes are excluded. Thus cases of contagious
                    zymotic disease are not admitted now in many instances, especially in London
                    since the establishment of the metropolitan asylums, fever and smallpox
                    hospitals. Lying-in cases, venereal cases, &amp;c., are also frequently
                    excluded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Special Hospitals</hi> are of various kinds, such as lying-in
                    hospitals, ophthalmic, lock (for venereal diseases), cancer, consumption,
                    &amp;c., besides fever and small-pox hospitals. At the end of the last and
                    beginning of this century fever hospitals were generally called “houses of
                    recovery,” with a view of not alarming the people too much who had to resort to
                    them. Special hospitals are also set apart for the treatment of diseases of
                    children.</p>
                <p>Besides the various civil hospitals there are also naval and military hospitals
                    for the cure of sailors and soldiers.</p>
                <p>Although hospitals have been intended as a blessing and benefit to the poor, they
                    have too often proved the reverse, on account of the ignorance, on the part of
                    their administrators, of the true principles of health. So much was this the
                    case formerly that it has been not infrequently debated whether hospitals are or
                    are not gigantic evils; and even where it is admitted that they are of value in
                    cases of actual disease, it is still doubtful if they are really of benefit in
                    cases of confinement It may be of use to consider briefly the statistics of
                    mortality at different times and in different places. It is very difficult to
                    compare former death-rates with present or recent if we consider cases in bulk,
                    because previous to the present century it was but little the custom to classify
                    cases; so that a preponderance of surgical cases might exist at one period and
                    of medical at another, with a corresponding variation of the death-rate. Of
                    course in some exceptional instances we can point to remarkable differences due
                    to known causes of unhealthiness. Thus in the Hôtel Dieu of Paris, in the last
                    century, a terrible mortality occurred, amounting to 1 in 4 J, or 220 per 1000
                    (Tenon);—and in the British hospitals at Scutari the mortality reached between
                    400 and 500 per 1000. In both of those cases there was inordinate crowding, such
                    as is hardly likely to be met with again. But in dealing with ordinary hospitals
                    there are so many modifying causes that the comparison, without careful
                    analysis, may be misleading. Thus Dr Steele has shown that in the last century
                    (1730-1800) the death-rate of St Thomas’s was 86 per 1000, whilst that of Guy’s
                    was 119; but this, as he points out, may have arisen from the latter being
                    looked upon as an asylum for incurables. In 1875 the death-rates of the general
                    hospitals in London ranged from 72 per 1000 in the Royal Free to 127 in King’s
                    College; in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary it was 92, and in the Glasgow 118. But
                    it is when we examine the mortality of special cases that the most instructive
                    lessons are to be learned; and the best for this purpose are surgical cases and
                    lying-in cases. From these we gather that the mortality is pretty generally in
                    the ratio of the size of the hospital and the consequent aggregation of
                    patients, the crowding together of patients in the wards, the deficiency of
                    ventilation, defective sewerage arrangements, and the want of constant attention
                    to the details of cleanliness. Thus Sir James Simpson showed in his paper on
                    “Hospitalism” the following statistics of mortality from amputations :—</p>

                <p>Baron Meydell, chief of the sanitary department of St Petersburg, has shown that
                    in the largest lying-in hospital there, in which 2000 women are confined in a
                    year, the death-rate is from 30 to 40 per 1000; in the second, in which about
                    1000 women per annum are received, only 25 die; in the third, where 400 are
                    received, only 20 die per 1000; in the small detached asylums of 2 or 3 beds, of
                    which there are 11 in different parts of the city, giving accommodation to 1600
                    women per annum, or about 155 each, only 9 per 1000 die; whilst amongst those
                    confined in their own homes, including the poorest and most wretched, only 5 per
                    1000 die <hi rend="italic">{Rapport du Congrès</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Brussels, 1876, vol. i. p. 226). These numbers correspond with the observations
                    above.</p>
                <p>It can also be shown that outbreaks of disease are coincident with individual
                    overcrowding, whether the hospital be large or small. Thus the terrible
                    mortality of the Hôtel-Dieu of Paris in the last century was due as much to
                    actual overcrowding as to the enormous aggregation of patients. The
                    extraordinary spectacle was to be seen there of two or three small-pox patients,
                    or several surgical cases, or sometimes even four parturient women, lying in one
                    bed. A large proportion of the beds were purposely made for four patients, and
                    six were frequently crowded in. In the Salle St Charles and St Antoine there
                    were 139 large beds (intended for four patients each, but often holding six),
                    and 38 small beds for one patient each. Those beds were generally full, giving
                    under ordinary conditions 558 patients, and in times of pressure 836. To this
                    might be added the Salle St Roch, opening directly from and really forming part
                    of the great ward; this contained 35 large beds and 3 small,—normal number of
                    patients 143, with a possible increase to 213. This gives a grand total of 701
                    patients as a normal amount, with a possible increase to 1049.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n314/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0314-0303"/>
                <p>There was thus collected in one enormous ward a larger number of patients than
                    any hospital in England contained altogether, if we except the Royal Naval
                    Hospital at Haslar. In addition, however, to the above inordinate number, there
                    were in the three stories placed above this great ward 1926 patients, which
                    number might be increased to 2596,—without reckoning the serving staff of the
                    institution;—or (including the wards on the Pont Double) a total in one block of
                    building equal to 3418, which might be increased to 4320. The law forbade the
                    hospital authorities to refuse admission to anyone, and in 1773 there were 5000
                    patients in the hospital, which occupied a space of little more than 3 English
                    acres,—giving a total gross area of only 30 square feet per head. The gross area
                    per bed of the modern Hôtel-Dieu is just ten times this amount, being 311 square
                    feet, according to Μ. Toilet; but even this is much too small, 100 square metres
                    (1076 square feet) being the minimum proposed by Toilet, who estimates the
                    general average per inhabitant of Paris at 430 square feet, whereas that of
                    London is nearly double. We cannot point to any such overcrowding in England as
                    that of the old Hôtel-Dieu, but in many cases there has been enough to produce
                    very grave results. The ill effects are seen in outbreaks of erysipelas,
                    hospital gangrene, and surgical fever among surgical cases, and in puerperal
                    fever in lying-in cases,—whilst in all communicable diseases the danger of
                    spreading is greatly intensified. It was observed in 1877 in the General
                    Lying-in Hospital, the year before it was closed for alterations, that when only
                    two or three women were in a ward, puerperal disease rarely showed itself, but
                    that when, in consequence of pressure of applications, five or six were put in,
                    disease generally broke out. Similar results have been observed elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Another great cause of mortality has been inefficient ventilation. If we can
                    scatter our sick population and give them individually plenty of space in their
                    wards, we shall have done much,—but, if we do not also change the air
                    sufficiently often we may still have evil results with all our care. Formerly no
                    arrangements were made for ventilation in hospitals, schools, barracks,
                    churches, or indeed in any buildings whatsoever. An immense deal remains tobe
                    desired in this direction still, but in recent hospitals, at least, more or less
                    efficient means have been introduced, whilst efforts have been made to improve
                    the conditions of the old. The want of fresh air aggravates all diseases,
                    increases the power of infection, retards the convalescence, and hastens the
                    death of patients <hi rend="italic">; moreover,</hi> it lowers the tone of the
                    healthy, and is the most potent of all agents in the propagation of phthisis or
                    destructive lung disease. The labours of the Royal Commission of 1857, appointed
                    to inquire into the health of the army, brought out in full relief the
                    disastrous effects of want of proper ventilation in the sleeping rooms of our
                    soldiers. It was there shown that the death-rate of Her Majesty’s Foot Guards
                    was more than 20 per 1000 per annum, 67 per cent, greater than the death-rate at
                    the same ages in Manchester, our most unhealthy town, double the general
                    death-rate of England, and nearly three times that of the most healthy country
                    districts. As regards phthisis alone the death-rate was 10∙8 per 1000 from
                    1830-1836, and ll·9 from 1837 to 1846, or an average of 114 per 1000 for the
                    period, an amount more than the total mortality of the civil male population of
                    England and Wales at the same ages. In the army generally the proportion was 7 ’
                    86. Since the evil was recognized steps have been taken to remedy the
                    conditions, particularly in the direction of giving more space in barrack-rooms,
                    and securing a certain standard of air renewal. The results are seen in the
                    present death-rate from phthisis, which is reduced to 2 ’ 5 per 1000, about
                    one-third of the old, and not much above that of the best districts in England.
                    It is still, however, too high, as a large number of men are invalided for
                    disease who go to swell the returns of sickness and mortality in civil life.
                    That this is mainly owing to defective air renewal is evident from the fact that
                    in civil life starvation, crowding, and poverty are insufficient to produce the
                    same evil results we have seen in our army,—because, in all likelihood, the very
                    wretchedness of the dwellings of the poor has brought about an amount of
                    involuntary air renewal, which has been their safeguard.</p>
                <p>Defective arrangements for the removal of excreta have constituted another cause
                    of mortality. Water closets opening directly out of wards, and sinks,
                    waste-pipes, bathpipes, &lt;fcc., in direct communication with the sewers, have
                    been the means of introducing sewer poison into hospitals, producing surgical
                    and puerperal diseases, enteric fever, and diphtheria, and aggravating every
                    other form of malady.</p>
                <p>A want of constant attention to the details of cleanliness has been a fertile
                    source of hospital disease. Dr B. W. Richardson has traced out in a very
                    instructive way the remarkable immunity of the Jews from epidemic and other
                    diseases, and has shown that their religious attention to the details of the
                    periodic cleansing enjoined by the Mosaic law appears to be the main cause of
                    this notable circumstance. An instructive instance of the importance of this
                    point is recorded by Mr W. Cadge, surgeon of the Norwich Infirmary, which
                    institution had long suffered from surgical diseases, such as erysipelas,
                    pyaemia, and the like. These, it was supposed, were mainly due to the age and
                    structural defects of the building, so that it was determined to pull it down
                    and reconstruct it throughout. In the meantime a change of administration took
                    place, and a new matron was introduced, who effected an entire alteration in the
                    arrangements, and in particular insisted on an absolute and unremitting
                    attention to every detail of cleanliness, both of building, clothing, bedding,
                    and person. The result was an immediate cessation of the dreaded complications
                    which had so vexed the hospital, and from that time there has been no return of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Faulty diet had also, doubtless, its influence on mortality, although its effects
                    would be less easy to trace. One singular feature in the last century was the
                    enormous allowance of beer given to patients in hospital,—from two to three
                    pints being common, and the allowance sometimes reaching half a gallon per diem.
                    The absence of fresh vegetables from the diet, not only of hospitals but also of
                    the populace at large, probably introduced a scorbutic taint which may have had
                    some part in aggravating or modifying disease.</p>
                <p>Some influence must also be allowed to the indiscriminate mixture of cases. The
                    evil of this, especially in the more or less crowded state of the older
                    hospitals, was recognized even in the last century, and was referred to by Tenon
                    among others Although the danger is materially lessened when ample space per bed
                    is allowed, it is still unadvisable, not to say unfair, to place contagious
                    cases with other patients. The argument has been advanced that by distributing
                    infectious cases there is less danger of concentration of poison than when they
                    are congregated together by themselves. With proper hygienic precautions,
                    however, this concentration may be minimized, whilst the isolation of such cases
                    gives the greatest immunity to others.</p>
                <p>This question of concentration has been pushed still further, so as to bear
                    against the existence of all hospitals whatsoever, and so far as lying-in
                    hospitals are concerned we have seen that the objections are well founded. But
                    when we consider the subject in its various aspects it must be admitted that it
                    would be difficult to do without hospitals in some form or another. It would
                    hardly be possible<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n315/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0315-0304"/> to afford people the same advantages of
                    treatment, attendance, nursing, and comforts at their own homes, although in
                    some cases the system of home treatment might be advantageously substituted, as
                    has been done for so many years with so much success in Edinburgh and other
                    towns of Scotland on the dispensary system. Another most important aspect of the
                    question is the necessity for hospitals as places of instruction for those
                    entering the profession of medicine. Although it would be wrong to subordinate
                    in any serious way the claims of patients of any class to the requirements of
                    teaching, it must yet be admitted that the only sound way of learning medicine
                    and surgery is by clinical or bedside instruction, and we may therefore
                    reasonably demand that those who owe their treatment and care to public charity
                    should be willing so far to contribute to the general welfare. Now it is clear
                    that in dealing with large classes of students it would hardly be possible to
                    convey proper clinical instruction except in a hospital. For this purpose the
                    provincial hospitals ought to be more largely utilized, in addition to the
                    metropolitan; at present the resources of the former are to a great extent
                    wasted for teaching purposes.</p>
                <p>Assuming then the necessity for hospitals, there still remains the question of
                    the kind of hospital that should be constructed or approved of. It is certainly
                    open to doubt whether we should continue to build monumental hospitals, and not
                    rather construct slighter buildings, which may be destroyed and rebuilt from
                    time to time, thus both scattering patients over a wider area and lessening the
                    risk from long accumulation of infective material. This latter has been named
                    the cottage or hut system of construction. The difficulties attending it are
                    chiefly connected with original expense of site and with the current expenses of
                    nursing and administration. On the other hand, it may be urged with some reason
                    that with correct hygienic management there is no reason why a large hospital
                    should not be kept in a healthy condition.</p>
                <p>We may now consider the principles of hospital construction.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Locality and Site.—</hi> Hospitals are required for the use
                    of the community in a certain locality, and to be of use they must be within
                    reach of the centre of population. Formerly the greater difficulty of locomotion
                    made it necessary that they should be actually in the midst of towns and cities,
                    and to some extent this continues to prevail. It is at least doubtful if this be
                    the best plan. Fresh and pure air being a prime necessity, as well as a
                    considerable amount of space of actual area in proportion to population, it
                    would certainly appear to be better to place hospitals as much in the outskirts
                    as is consistent with considerations of usefulness and convenience. In short,
                    the best site would be open fields; but, if that be impracticable, a large
                    space—a “sanitary zone,” as it is called by Toilet—should be kept permanently
                    free between them and surrounding buildings, certainly never less than double
                    the height of the highest building. The difference between the expense of
                    purchase of land in a town and in the environs is generally considerable;—and
                    this is therefore an additional reason for choosing a suburban locality. Even
                    with existing hospitals it would be in most cases pecuniarily advantageous to
                    dispose of the present building and site and retain only a receiving house in
                    the town. St Thomas’s in London, the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris, and the Royal
                    Infirmary in Manchester are all good examples where this might have been carried
                    out. In none, however, has this been done, the first two having been rebuilt, at
                    enormous outlay, in the cities as before, although not exactly in the same
                    locality, while the last is still retained with a few structural alterations. In
                    Edinburgh, on the other hand, an open space of a much more favourable character
                    has been obtained, which, although within the limits of the city, is almost
                    rural in character.</p>
                <p>As regards the actual site itself, where circumstances admit of choice, a dry
                    gravelly or sandy soil should be selected, in a position where the ground water
                    is low and but little subject to fluctuations of level, and where the means of
                    drainage are capable of being effectually carried out. There should also be a
                    cheerful sunny aspect, and some protection from the coldest winds.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Form of Building.—</hi> A form of building must be selected
                    which answers the following conditions:—(a) the freest possible circulation of
                    air round each ward, with no <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac</hi> or enclosed
                    spaces where air can stagnate; (J) free play of sunlight upon each ward during
                    at least some portion of the day; (c) the possibility of isolating any ward, or
                    group of wards, effectually, in case of infectious disease breaking out; <hi
                    rend="italic">{d)</hi> the possibility of ventilating every ward independently
                    of any other part of the establishment. Those conditions can only be fulfilled
                    by one system, viz., a congeries of houses or pavilions, more or less connected
                    with each other by covered ways, so as to facilitate convenient and economical
                    administration. The older plans of huge blocks of building, arranged in squares
                    or rectangles, enclosing spaces without free circulation of air, are obviously
                    objectionable. Even when arranged in single lines or crosses they are not
                    desirable, as the wards either communicate with each other or with common
                    passages or corridors, rendering separation impossible. On this point it may be
                    remarked that some of the buildings of the last century were more wisely
                    constructed than many of those in the first half of the present, and that the
                    older buildings have been from time to time spoilt by ignorant additions made in
                    later times. The question next arises —Is it better to have pavilions of two or
                    more stories high, or to have single-storied huts or cottages, scattered more
                    widely? Where land is expensive the former plan is of course more economical,
                    but where land is easily got the latter ought to be adopted. The pavilions may
                    be arranged in various ways: they may be joined at one end by a corridor, or may
                    be divided by a central corridor at right angles to them, &amp;c. In fact, the
                    plan is very elastic, and adapts itself to almost any circumstances. A certain
                    distance, not less than twice the height of the pavilions, ought to be preserved
                    between them. By this means free circulation of air and plenty of light are
                    secured, whilst separation or isolation may be at once accomplished if
                    required.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Foundations, Building Materials, &lt;kc.—</hi> It is of the
                    first consequence that a hospital should be dry; therefore the foundation and
                    walls ought to be constructed so as to prevent the inroads of damp. An
                    impervious foundation has the further advantage of preventing emanations from
                    the soil rising up in consequence of the suction force produced by the higher
                    temperature of the internal atmosphere of the building itself. There should be
                    free ventilation in the basement, and the raising of the whole on arches is a
                    good plan, now generally carried out in hot climates. If the pavilions are two
                    or more stories high it is advisable to use fire-proof material as much as
                    possible, but single-storied huts may be of wood. In any case effectual means of
                    excluding damp must be employed. The interiors of wards ought to be rendered as
                    non-absorbent as possible, by being covered with impervious coatings, such as
                    glazed tiles (parian, though much used, is apt to crack), silicate paint,
                    soluble glass, or the like. The ceilings ought to be treated in the same way as
                    the walls, or, perhaps better still, they might be made like the deck of a ship,
                    without any lath and plaster, so as to have nothing but the floor itself between
                    room and room. For the floors themselves various materials have been suggested:
                    in France there is a preference for flags (dalles), but in England wood is more
                    liked; and indeed hard well-fitting wood, such as teak, oak, or pitch-pine,
                    leaves nothing to be desired. The surface should be waxed and polished or
                    varnished. Even deal floors can be rendered non-absorbent by waxing, by
                    impregnating them -with solid paraffin as recommended by Dr Langstaff, or by
                    painting with soluble glass as suggested by Dr Luther of Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Shape and Arrangement of Wards.—</hi> It is now generally
                    agreed that wards should have windows on at least two opposite sides, and three
                    main shapes have been proposed, viz., (a) long wards with windows down each
                    side, and (generally) one at the further end; (5) wards nearly square, with
                    windows on three sides; and (c) circular wards, with windows all round. The
                    first (a) is the form usually adopted in pavilions; (Z&gt;) is recommended by Dr
                    Folsom <hi rend="italic">{Plans for the Johns Hopkins Hospital)</hi>; and (c)
                    has been suggested by Mr John Marshall,. F.R.S. <hi rend="italic">{Nat. Assoc,
                    for Promotion of Social Science,</hi> 1878). Of these <hi rend="italic">{b)</hi>
                    seems the least to be commended, and <hi rend="italic">{c)</hi> has not yet been
                    tried in practice; we may therefore confine our attention to the long or oblong
                    wards. The length is to be determined chiefly by the number of patients to be
                    accommodated, but the breadth admits of less variation. Each bed should be a
                    little distance, say from 8 inches to 1 foot from the wall, and each bed may be
                    reckoned as 6⅛ feet long; this gives 7⅜ feet on each side. Between the ends of
                    the beds about 10 feet space is necessary, so that 25 or 26 feet of total
                    breadth may be taken as a favourable width. The wards of the Herbert Hospital
                    are 26 feet; but some exceed this, as, for instance, St Thomas’s, London, and
                    the New Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, 28; New Hôtel-Dieu, 29; and Lariboisière,
                    30. There seems no necessity for exceeding 26, but if the breadth be greater
                    there ought to be more window-space,— the great difficulty being to get a wide
                    space thoroughly ventilated. There ought to be only two rows of beds, one down
                    each wall, with if possible a window to each bed, and never less than one to
                    every two beds.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Ventilation, Warming, and Lighting.—</hi> For ventilation
                    two things are required,—sufficient space and sufficiently frequent change or
                    renewal of air. As regards space, this must be considered <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0316-0305"/> with reference both to total space and to lateral
                    or floor space. Unless a minimum of floor space be laid down, we shall always be
                    in danger of overcrowding, for cubic space may be supplied vertically with
                    little or no advantage to the occupier. If we allow a minimum distance of 4 feet
                    between the beds and 10 feet between the ends of the beds, this gives 100 square
                    feet of space per bed; less than this is undesirable. In severe surgical cases,
                    fever cases, and the like, a much larger space is required; and in the Edinburgh
                    New Infirmary 150 square feet is allowed. Cubic space must be regulated by the
                    means of ventilation; we can rarely change the air offener than three times an
                    hour, and therefore the space ought to be at least one-third of the hourly
                    supply. This ought not to be less than 4000 cubic feet per bed, even in ordinary
                    cases of sickness,— and the third of that is 1333 cubic feet of space. With 100
                    square feet of floor space a ward of 13⅜ feet high would supply this amount, and
                    there is but little to be gained by raising the ceiling higher,— ndeed, 12 feet
                    is practically enough. The experiments of Drs Cowles and Wood of Boston (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Report of State Board of Health of Massachusetts</hi> for 1879)
                    show that above 12 feet there is little or no movement in the air except towards
                    the outlet ventilator; the space above is therefore of little value as
                    ventilation space. Additional height adds also to the cost of construction,
                    increases the expense of warming, makes cleaning more difficult, and to some
                    extent hampers ventilation. Whatever be the height of wards, the windows must
                    reach to the ceiling, or there must be ventilators in the ceiling or at the top
                    of the side walls. If this be not arranged for a mass of foul air is apt to
                    stagnate near the ceiling, and sooner or later to be driven down upon the
                    inmates. The reasons for a large and constant renewal of air are of course the
                    immediate removal and dilution of the organic matter given off by the inmates;
                    and, as this is greater in quantity and more offensive and dangerous in sickness
                    than in health, the change of air in the former case must be greater than in the
                    latter. Hence in serious cases an amount of air practically unlimited is
                    desirable,—the aim of true ventilation being to approach as near as possible to
                    the condition of pure external air. Without going too much into details, a few
                    general rules may be laid down :—(1) Fresh air ought if possible to be brought
                    in at the lowest part of the ward, warmed if necessary; (2) foul air ought to be
                    taken out at the highest part of the ward; (3) fresh air should reach each
                    patient without passing over the bed of any other; (4) the vitiated air should
                    be removed from each patient without passing over the bed of any other; (5) 4000
                    cubic feet of fresh air per head per hour should be the minimum in ordinary
                    cases of sickness, to be increased without limit in severer cases; (6) the air
                    should move in no part of a ward ata greater rate than 1⅛ feet per second,
                    except at the point of entry, where it should not exceed 5 feet per second, and
                    at the outlet, where the rate may be somewhat higher; about 64 square inches of
                    inlet and outlet sectional area ought to be supplied per head as a minimum; (7)
                    every opportunity ought to be taken of freely flushing the wards with air, by
                    means of open windows, when this can be done with safety.</p>
                <p>Warming is a question of great importance in most climates, especially in such a
                    climate as ours, where everj <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> system of
                    ventilation must involve either the warming of some portion of the incoming air,
                    or the contriving its delivery without too great lowering of temperature; at the
                    same time it cannot be too strongly insisted upon that the tendency is too much
                    in the direction of allowing warmth to supersede freshness of air. There are
                    very few cases of disease (if any) that are not more injured by foul air than by
                    low temperature; and in the zymotic diseases, such as typhus, enteric fever,
                    small-pox, &amp;c., satisfactory results have been obtained even in winter
                    weather by almost open-air treatment. At the same time a reasonable warmth is
                    desirable on all grounds if it can be obtained without sacrificing purity of
                    atmosphere. For all practical purposes 60° to 63° F. is quite sufficient, and
                    surgical and lying-in cases do well in lower temperatures. Various plans of
                    warming have been recommended, but probably a combination is the best. It is
                    unadvisable to do away altogether with radiant heat, although it is not always
                    possible to supply sufficient warmth with open fireplaces alone. A portion of
                    the air may be warmed by being passed oyer a heating apparatus before it enters
                    the ward, by having an air chamber round the fire-place or stove, or by the use
                    of hot-water pipes in the ward itself. In each case, however, the air must be
                    supplied independently to each ward, so that no general system of ventilation is
                    applicable.</p>
                <p>The lighting of wards at night will be most conveniently done by means of gas, in
                    the form of a jet over each bed, with a special ventilator to carry off
                    combustion products, as in the Edinburgh New Infirmary.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Furniture of Wards.—</hi> This should be simple, clean, and
                    nonabsorbent; the bedsteads of iron, mattresses hair, laid on spring bottoms
                    without sacking. No curtains should be permitted.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Watcr. —</hi> The water-supply ought to be on the constant
                    system, and plentiful; 50 gallons per head per diem may be taken as a fair
                    minimum estimate.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Closets, Baths,</hi> &amp;c.—The closets ought to be of the
                    simplest construction, the pans of earthenware all in one piece, the flushing
                    arrangements moved by opening the door,—the supply of water ample. Each ward
                    should have its own closets, lavatories, &amp;c., built in small annexes, with a
                    cross-ventilated vestibule separating them from the ward. All the pipes should
                    be disconnected from the drains, the closets by intercepting traps, the sink and
                    waste pipes by being made to pour their contents over trapped gratings. The soil
                    pipes should be ventilated, and placed outside the walls, protected as may be
                    necessary from frost. Each ward should have a movable bath which can be wheeled
                    to the patient’s bedside.</p>
                <p>9. Each ward should have attached to it a room for the nurse from which she can
                    look into the ward, a small kitchen for any special cooking that may be
                    required, a room for the physician or surgeon, and generally a room with one or
                    two separate beds. No cooking should be done in the wards, nor ought washing,
                    airing, or drying of linen to be allowed there.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Nursing.—</hi> The arrangements for nursing the sick have
                    greatly improved in recent times, although controversy still goes on as to the
                    best method of carrying it out. In arranging for the nursing in a hospital both
                    efficiency and economy have to be considered. Miss Nightingale recommends large
                    wards of 32 beds each, as at the Herbert Hospital, on the ground that one
                    head-nurse is sufficient for such a number by day and one nurse by night. In the
                    Edinburgh New Infirmary the wards are not so large, the medical being arranged
                    for 21, and the surgical for 14 patients. Circumstances must to a large extent
                    determine the arrangement, but it seems desirable on the whole that the work of
                    a nurse should be confined to a single ward at a time if possible. The duties of
                    nurses ought also to be distinctly confined to attendance on the sick, and no
                    menial work, such as scrubbing floors and the like, should be demanded of them;
                    a proper staff of servants ought to be employed for such purposes. It is alsc
                    desirable that a separate pavilion for lodging the nurses should be set apart,
                    and that fair and reasonable time for rest and recreation should be allowed.
                    Some discussion has taken place as to the advisability of placing the nursing of
                    a hospital in the hands of a sisterhood or separate corporation. It will,
                    however, be admitted that the best plan is for the nursing staff of each
                    hospital to be special and under one head within the establishment itself, even
                    although it may be connected with some main institution outside. The nursing
                    must of course be carried on in accordance with the directions and treatment of
                    the physicians and surgeons.</p>
                <p>11. The kitchen, laundry, dispensary, and other offices must be in a separate
                    pavilion or pavilions, away from the wards, but within convenient access.</p>
                <p>12. A separate pavilion for isolation of infectious cases is desirable. This may
                    be a wooden hut, or in some cases even a tent; either is probably preferable to
                    a permanent block of building.</p>
                <p>13. A <hi rend="italic">Disinfecting Chamber</hi> ought to be provided, where
                    heat can be applied to clothes and bedding, for the destruction both of vermin
                    and of the germs of disease. It is advisable to expose all bedding and clothing
                    to its influence after each occasion of wear. Although this may entail
                    additional expense from deterioration of fabric, it is worth the outlay to
                    secure immunity from disease. This plan is rigidly followed at the Royal South
                    Hants Infirmary at Southampton.</p>
                <p>14. It is of great importance that the wards should be periodically emptied, and
                    kept unoccupied for not less than one month in each year, and longer if
                    possible. During such period thorough cleansing and flushing with air could be
                    carried out, so as to prevent any continuous deposit of organic matter.</p>
                <p>Up to quite lately hospital accommodation was confined to the larger towns, but
                    the desirability of having it more accessible in smaller towns and villages has
                    made itself more and more felt. Accordingly in many places <hi rend="italic"
                    >cottage hospitals</hi> have been established with advantage. One greatadvantage
                    of the pavilion system is that the principles of its construction and
                    arrangements are equally applicable to large and small establishments, so that
                    we may either look upon a large hospital as an extension of a cottage hospital,
                    or upon a small one as a section of a pavilion one. The importance of increased
                    accommodation for the reception of infectious cases is now very generally
                    acknowledged, as shown not only by the establishment of the Metropolitan Asylums
                    Hospitals, but also of others in various parts of the country. In some instances
                    they have apparently been the means of arresting the spread of disease and
                    protecting the locality from epidemics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paying Hospitals, Pay-Wards, Provident Dispensaries.—</hi> The
                    general object for which hospitals have been established may be stated to be the
                    gratuitous medical and surgical treatment of the indigent sick. Many abuses
                    have, ho∖v-ever<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0317-0306"/>, crept in, and large numbers of persons yearly
                    receive medical treatment gratuitously who are quite able to pay for it. The
                    numbers have been stated at one in four in London and one in two in Liverpool of
                    the entire population. To obviate this evil the establishment of paying
                    institutions has been much recommended. There is a large class above the very
                    poor who are but ill able to afford the most skilled attendance and nursing at
                    their own homes, which in most cases do not supply the accommodation necessary
                    for sickness. It is not desirable, nor is it always their own wish, that those
                    persons should be objects of charity, and the establishment of hospitals and
                    dispensaries at which they could contribute something towards the expense of
                    their treatment and attendance would meet the difficulty to some extent.
                    Numerous arrangements of the kind are to be found on the continent of Europe, in
                    America, and in the British colonies. Attempts have recently been made to
                    introduce the system into England, and it is highly desirable that it should be
                    accomplished, if it can be done with fairness to all concerned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> In the civil hospitals of Britain this is
                    usually carried on by a body of governors, who are either specially appointed or
                    are benefactors of the institution. From them an executive committee is chosen,
                    or the executive power may be vested in a single official, often the treasurer.
                    A secretary or superintendent is usually charged with the financial and general
                    management of the affairs of the hospital, whilst an apothecary superintends the
                    pharmaceutic department. The treatment of the sick is of course entirely in the
                    hands of the physicians and surgeons, whose appointments are for the most part
                    honorary, in the sense of being unpaid, and under whom resident medical officers
                    act. The medical staff ought always to be represented on the governing body as a
                    means of preventing unnecessary friction. The appointment seems desirable in
                    every hospital of a sanitary officer, whose duty it should be to watch and
                    supervise the carrying out of every detail of ventilation, warming, cleanliness,
                    disinfection, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>On the Continent hospitals are more directly under state control, and their
                    arrangement is therefore considerably modified.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Naval, and Military Hospitals.—</hi> These are provided in all
                    civilized countries for the care of the sailors and soldiers of the state. The
                    two great English hospitals of Greenwich and Chelsea were founded as asylums for
                    disabled and superannuated sailors and soldiers, but the former is now given up
                    for that purpose, although a part is appropriated as a hospital for sick
                    merchant seamen of all nations. The chief naval hospitals are those of Haslar,
                    Plymouth, and Chatham. Haslar is the largest hospital in the country, having
                    been originally intended for 2000 sick, and even now, with increased allowance
                    of space per bed, accommodating 1500 patients. There are also hospitals in most
                    of the principal naval stations abroad, such as Malta, Jamaica, Halifax,
                    Hong-Kong, &amp;c. The principal military hospitals are the Royal Victoria
                    Hospital at Netley (the invaliding hospital of the army and the locality of the
                    army medical school), the Herbert Hospital at Woolwich, the Cambridge Hospital
                    at Aldershott, and numerous others at the principal stations. The cubic space
                    allotted by regulation is 1200 cubic feet at home and 1500 to 2000 cubic feet in
                    the tropics per bed. Formerly every regiment of cavalry and infantry and each
                    battery or troop of artillery had its own hospital, but this plan is now given
                    up, and station hospitals with a fixed staff are being arranged at the chief
                    centres of military districts. In both the army and the navy the regulations
                    place the administration and command of hospitals in the hands of the respective
                    medical departments; in the army this is as yet only partially carried out, but
                    it has been accomplished in the navy with the advantage of both efficiency and
                    economy. In time of war general hospitals are established at the base of
                    operations, whilst field hospitals move with the troops as the campaign
                    progresses.</p>
                <p>In France there have long been hospitals established for the navy, such as those
                    at Rochefort, Toulon, Brest, &amp;c., as well as schools of instruction for
                    medical officers. The chief military hospital is the Val de Grâce at Paris,
                    formerly a convent; it is there that the medical school for the army is located.
                    Large hospitals are also established in all the great stations. Great attention
                    to military hospitals is also paid in Germany, Austria, and other countries of
                    Europe. In most of them the administration is in the hands of the medical
                    department, except in France, where the intendance still holds the reins, much
                    to the disadvantage of efficiency and good working.</p>
                <p>In the United States of America the army is small and chiefly employed on
                    frontier duties, so that the hospitals are all what are called post hospitals,
                    and as a rule are wooden huts or temporary structures, built to last ten years,
                    and to hold 12 to 24 beds. There are, however, two permanent hospitals, one for
                    cadets at West Point, and the other, the Barnes Hospital, at the Soldier’s Home
                    near Washington. All the arrangements are under the army medical department. The
                    navy and the mercantile marine were long amalgamated in America, so far as
                    hospital arrangements went. The Marine Hospital Service was formed in 1798, and
                    the navy was not separated from it until 1811, although it was not for some
                    years after that special naval hospitals were built. In connexion with the
                    marine hospital service, hospitals have been established at a great number of
                    ports, both sea, river, and lake. Up tσ 1870 each of these hospitals had its own
                    organization, but since that time a regular service has been established under a
                    supervising surgeon-general. A tax of 40 cents a month is levied for the service
                    upon all seamen or members whatsoever of a ship’s company. One of the finest
                    hospitals is the Mercantile Marine Hospital at Chicago, a pavilion building of
                    several stories, and of considerable architectural pretensions. But in America,
                    as in Europe, the tendency has latterly been to abandon such monumental
                    hospitals, and to construct single-storied pavilions on the hut or “barrack”
                    principle,—the word barrack being employed in this sense as equivalent to the
                    French <hi rend="italic">baraque,</hi> a wooden hut. Accordingly the new marine
                    hospital at San Francisco has been thus constructed, three one-storied pavilions
                    of Californian redwood radiating from the outside of a curved corridor, from the
                    ends and inner centre of which project the administrative blocks. The cost is
                    about £120 ($600) per bed, whereas the average cost of the older ones was fully
                    seven times that amount, with the drawback that in course of time they became
                    extremely unhealthy, and showed all the evils of hospitalism.</p>
                <p>A brief notice may be added here of the history of hospital construction in
                    recent times, particularly with reference to the pavilion system. It is to
                    France that we must look for the commencement of that system, although it has
                    been carried out with even greater success in other countries. Its origin may be
                    traced to the discussions which arose from time to time as to the advisability
                    of reconstructing the Hôtel-Dieu at Paris. So long ago as the 17th century,
                    Desgodets, architect to Louis XIV., presented a plan for reconstructing the
                    hospital in “rayons.” But it was after the fire that took place in 1772 that the
                    question was taken up with real interest. In 1773 it was proposed to transfer
                    the hospital to the plain of Grenelle, and in 1774 Μ. Petit proposed a radiating
                    building of four stories at the base of the hill of Belleville (probably at no
                    great distance from the existing hospital of Ménilmontant). Μ. le Boi presented
                    a plan for a hospital at Chaillot, consisting of long singlestory pavilions,
                    arranged alternately, with the roof open at intervals,—each patient to be
                    screened off by partitions. Finally, the committee of the Académie des Sciences
                    reported favourably in 1788 on a proposal of Μ. Poyet’s to construct a hospital
                    on the Ile des Cygnes (between Grenelle and Passy), consisting of isolated
                    pavilions radiating from a central rotunda, the hospital to hold 5000 <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0318-0307"/> patients,—each pavilion to be 115 feet long, by
                    24 broad and 14 to 15 high, to contain 34 to 36 patients, and to have windows to
                    the ceiling. These proportions would give 77 to 80 square feet of floor space,
                    6⅛ to 6f feet of wall space, and 1080 to 1200 cubic feet of total space, an
                    immense advance upon then existing arrangements. The Revolution put a stop to
                    those projects, and half a century elapsed before a pavilion building, as now
                    understood, was actually constructed. Curiously enough, revolution again stepped
                    in to arrest the movement, for the first building of the kind, the Hôpital
                    Louis-Philippe, was begun in the last years of that monarch’s reign, and
                    suspended in consequence of the revolution of February 1848. Some years later,
                    in 1854, it was completed and renamed Lariboisière, from the name of the
                    benefactress whose munificence helped to bring it to a successful conclusion.
                    The building is oblong, enclosing a space in the centre, the front (south end)
                    containing the administration, and the opposite (north) end the chapel,
                    kitchens, &amp;c. From the two sides the pavilion wards jut out. The building is
                    on the whole not a good one; the distance between the pavilions is only half
                    what is required, and the wards are frequently overcrowded. Unfortunately most
                    of the defects, with some additional ones, have been reproduced in the new
                    Hôtel-Dieu. The new hospital at Ménilmontant, in the north-east of Paris, is
                    also a pavilion one, differing somewhat in detail, but of great size, each
                    pavilion having numerous stories. The military hospital at Vincennes is a good
                    specimen of modern construction. A small experimental pavilion, built on the
                    suggestions of Dr Tarnier in the garden of the Maternité in Paris, merits
                    notice. It consists of two stories, each containing four wards for one
                    parturient woman each. The kitchen, office, &amp;c., are in the centre, but the
                    only access to each ward is by the verandah direct from the open air. The walls,
                    floors, and ceilings are non-absorbent, and there is a space of 56 cubic metres,
                    or nearly 2000 cubic feet for each inmate. The chief objection is that there are
                    no means of ventilation except by the door or window;— otherwise the plan is
                    excellent. This plan of making each ward open directly from the open air was
                    proposed by the late Sir James Simpson, as a means of improving the sanitary
                    state of existing old hospitals. The plans of Μ. Toilet ought not to be passed
                    unnoticed. In addition to the ordinary principles of pavilion construction, he ’
                    insists upon the ogival or Gothic form of architecture, which he thinks was
                    adopted in the Middle Ages as much for sanitary as for architectural
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>In England the question of hospital improvement slept until the disasters at
                    Scutari, in 1854-55, roused the attention of the Government and the public to
                    the necessities of the case, and the report of the Army Sanitary Commission and
                    of the Barrack and Hospital Committee, and Miss Nightingale’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notes on Hospitals,</hi> led the way in advocating hospital reform.
                    Unfortunately just before this movement the plans of Netley Hospital were made,
                    and the building begun on the corridor system. Efforts were made to arrest its
                    progress, but unhappily without effect, and the country which has led the van in
                    sanitary science has as its chief military hospital a building far from
                    satisfactory. The first pavilion hospital in England was the Blackburn
                    Infirmary, built rather more than twenty years ago. The pavilions are there at
                    right angles to a centre corridor, and are alternate; a similar arrangement is
                    followed out at the Children’s Hospital at Pendlebury, near Manchester. St
                    Thomas’s at Westminster Bridge consists of a row of parallel pavilions united by
                    a corridor at one end. A plan practically identical was proposed for a new
                    hospital at Valetta (Malta), but this building, though frequently referred to in
                    books, has never been constructed. The Herbert Hospital at Woolwich consists of
                    parallel pavilions jutting out from the sides of a centre corridor at right
                    angles; although it is now nearly twenty years old, it is still one of the best
                    examples of a pavilion hospital. The latest pavilion hospital is the New Royal
                    Infirmary at Edinburgh, to which reference has already been made. Every care
                    seems to have been bestowed on its construction and arrangement; the space
                    allowed per head is ample and the site excellent.</p>
                <p>In Germany the Friedrichshain Hospital at Berlin is one of the best specimens of
                    a pavilion building. The pavilions are 160 feet apart, six two-storied and four
                    one-storied, with isolation wards and the necessary administrative buildings.
                    The hut hospital erected during the late war at Tempelhof near the same city was
                    a good example of how the pavilion system may be indefinitely extended, the huts
                    being placed in échelon in wide zigzag lines.</p>
                <p>In America great attention has been paid to the question of hospitals, especially
                    since its importance was so roughly thrust upon the country’s notice in the
                    great civil war of 1861-64. During that time numerous plans were tried, and
                    among others the old plan of Petit, Poyet, &amp;c., namely, radiating pavilions
                    from a circular or oval centre, which contained the offices and administration.
                    This plan was found not to be a good one, as it interfered with both lighting
                    and ventilation. The earliest American hospital of any size was the
                    Pennsylvanian Hospital of Philadelphia, which was begun in 1755, under the
                    auspices of Dr Thomas Bond and Benjamin Franklin, and finished in 1805. It was
                    also in Philadelphia that the first pavilion hospital of a permanent character
                    was erected, the corner stone being laid in 1860; in it the pavilions are
                    parallel, two stories besides basement and attics. The space allowed is ample,
                    but the wards are too wide, nearly 31 feet. In New York there is a large amount
                    of hospital accommodation—about 6000 beds, or about 1 in 1500 of the population.
                    The New York Hospital new pavilions give 112 square feet of floor space and 1800
                    cubic feet of total space. The Roosevelt Hospital has somewhat the same
                    dimensions, but with a much greater space for surgical patients. One peculiarity
                    of arrangement in that building is that the closets are not at the end of the
                    wards as usual, but in the centre, grouped round a central shaft which extends
                    through all the stories, cellar and basement. In this the water and steam pipes
                    are placed, as also the foul linen shafts; the closets are cleaned by a steam
                    jet. This plan does not seem very commendable. The Massachusetts General
                    Hospital at Boston is the oldest in America, except the Pennsylvania Hospital.
                    Since 1872 four new pavilions have been built on peculiar plans: two are square,
                    one containing one large ward for 20 patients, and the other divided into sma∏
                    rooms of 2 beds each, giving each about 97 feet of floor space and 1500 to 1850
                    feet of total space; the other two are oblong, divided into rows of single
                    rooms, with a dividing corridor, something like an arrangement of prison cells.
                    The floor space is about the same, with less height. The Johns Hopkins Hospital
                    at Baltimore will be memorable for the care bestowed upon the consideration of
                    its plans. The one finally adopted is on the pavilion principle, scattered over
                    a wide space of ground.</p>
