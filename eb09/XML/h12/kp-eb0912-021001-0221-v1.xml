                <p><label type="entry">HORTENSIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Quintus</hi></label>, was
                    one of the first and most famous orators at the Roman bar in the latter days of
                    the republic, when the orator’s art was particularly flourishing and was
                    diligently cultivated. His father had been governor of Sicily, and had left
                    behind him a good name for justice and uprightness. He was himself born in 114
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and he lived to the year 50 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c., so</hi> that his life and career ran parallel to that
                    of Cicero, whose senior he was by only eight years. He had the best possible
                    introductions into public life, and at the age of nineteen he made his first
                    speech at the bar, and shortly afterwards successfully conducted the defence of
                    a petty king of Bithynia, one of Rome’s many dependants in the East. From that
                    time his reputation as an eloquent advocate was decisively established. As the
                    son-in-law of Catulus he was attached to the aristocratical party of which Sulla
                    was the head, and among his clients he numbered several of its most eminent
                    members. During Sulla’s ascendency the courts of law were Under the control of
                    the senate, the judges being themselves senators. To this circumstance perhaps
                    as well as to his own merits Hortensius may have been indebted for much of his
                    success. Many of his clients were the governors of provinces which they were
                    accused of having plundered, and such men were generally sure to find themselves
                    brought before a somewhat lenient or even friendly tribunal, one, too, which was
                    shamefully accessible to corruption. Hortensius himself, according to Cicero,
                    was not ashamed to avail himself of this disgraceful weakness, and a good deal
                    of the plunder which his clients had got from the provincials went into the
                    pockets of the judges. Cicero made this statement in open court, and we are thus
                    driven to assume that it must have had some foundation.</p>
                <p>Hortensius, like other eminent Roman citizens, passed through the regular
                    succession of public offices, rising from the quaestorship in 81 to the
                    consulship in 69 B.c. In the year before his consulship he came into collision
                    with the now rapidly rising eloquence of Cicero in the memorable case of Verres,
                    and from that time his supremacy at the bar was shaken. In fact his younger
                    rival stepped into his position. Cicero’s success against a man who was backed
                    up by all the influence of Sulla’s party was a splendid triumph, and it must
                    have been a heavy blow to Hortensius. Shortly afterwards he was again pitted
                    against Cicero, and again failed. In 67 a proposal was made to supersede
                    Lucullus in his command in the East against Mithradates in favour of Pompeius.
                    This was supported by Cicero, and was successfully carried in face of the
                    opposition of Hortensius. From the year 63 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the
                    famous year of Cicero’s consulship and of the Catiline conspiracy, we find the
                    two great rivals often associated together as counsel in the same case. The fact
                    was that Cicero was now himself drawn towards the aristocratical party,—the
                    party of Hortensius. Consequently, in the many cases which had more or less of a
                    political complexion as arising out of the disorder and turbulence incident to
                    party quarrels, it was natural that the two men should have the same sympathies
                    and be engaged on the same side. So it happened, for example, in the case of
                    Licinius Murena, whom Cicero defended along with Hortensius against a charge of
                    bribery in canvassing for the consulship. And so strongly declared was his
                    sympathy with Milo against Cicero’s bitter enemy Clodius that he was nearly
                    murdered by some of Clodius’s gang. After Pompeius’s return from the East in 61
                    B.C., and the political revolution which for a time united him with Caesar,
                    Hortensius withdrew from public life and devoted himself exclusively to his
                    profession. For nine more years he was in continual employment as an advocate,
                    and won a number of verdicts. In 50 B.c., the last year of his life, he defended
                    successfully one Appius Claudius against Dolabella, Cicero’s son-in-law, who
                    prosecuted the man on a serious charge of bribery.</p>
                <p>None of Hortensius’s speeches have come down to us; and it was, it seems, only on
                    special occasions that he wrote them. Almost all our knowledge of him is derived
                    from Cicero. He was undoubtedly a highly-gifted and accomplished man, and though
                    of course he owed his very early success to his great connexions, yet he was
                    perfectly well able to stand on his own conspicuous merits. His eloquence
                    perhaps was not quite of the highest order it was not for the most part what
                    Cicero called “gravis,” weighty, dignified, impressive; there was, it may be
                    presumed, an absence of those appeals to great moral principles which give such
                    grandeur to the best speeches of Cicero and Demosthenes, and of our own Burke.
                    His oratory, according to his great rival, was of the Asiatic style, by which
                    appears to be meant a florid rhetoric, better to hear than to read. He had the
                    gift of a marvellously tenacious memory, and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0222-0211"/> could retain every single point in his
                    opponent’s argument. His action was highly artificial, and even his manner of
                    folding his toga was noted by eminent tragic actors of the day, and is left on
                    record by Macrobius. He had, too, a fine musical voice, which he could skilfully
                    command.</p>
                <p>Cicero sometimes speaks of Hortensius very favourably, and even almost
                    affectionately, though it would appear from some passages in his letters that he
                    never quite trusted him. He could not have thought him a high-principled man, as
                    he openly charged him with bribery, and as he actually mentions a case in which
                    he claimed property under a will which he knew to be a forgery (Z&gt;e <hi
                        rend="italic">Officiis,</hi> iii. 18). Hortensius, in fact, seems to have
                    been a lax, easygoing, clever man, with very little noble ambition and very
                    little real moral worth. “An amiable Epicurean” is a phrase which describes him
                    not unfairly. The anecdotes we have about him all point to a man of luxurious
                    tastes and a great capacity for enjoyment. The vast wealth he had accumulated
                    during forty-four years of successful practice he spent after the fashion of
                    rich Roman nobles, in splendid villas, in parks, in fish ponds, and costly
                    entertainments. He left his heir an unusually well-stocked cellar of wine, and
                    his park at Laurentum abounded in every variety of game. He was also a great
                    buyer of pictures and works of art. With true consistency he opposed Pompeius
                    and Crassus when they proposed their sumptuary law. He is said to have spoken
                    wittily on the occasion; he was at any rate successful.</p>
                <p>There is a good account of Hortensius in Dunlop’s <hi rend="italic">Roman
                        Literature</hi> (ii. 222), and in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                        Greek and Roman Biography</hi> his life and career are traced as thoroughly
                    as the materials at our disposal allow. (W. J. B.)</p>
