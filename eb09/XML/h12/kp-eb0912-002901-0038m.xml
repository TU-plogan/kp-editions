                    more important dispute with Bishop Atterbury against the Anglican doctrine of
                    nonresistance. His principal treatises on this subject were the <hi
                    rend="italic">Measures of Submission to the Civil Magistrate</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Origin and Institution of Civil Government discussed</hi>; and
                    his part in the discussion was so much appreciated by the Commons that in 1709
                    they presented an address to the queen praying her to “bestow some dignity in
                    the church on Mr Hoadly for his eminent services both to church and state.” The
                    queen returned a favourable answer, but the dignity was not conferred. In 1710
                    he was presented by a private patron to the rectory of Streatham in Surrey. In
                    1715 he was appointed chaplain to the king, and the same year he obtained the
                    bishopric of Bangor. In 1716 he published a <hi rend="italic">Preservative
                    against the Principles and Practices of Honjurors in Church and State,</hi> and
                    in the following year preached before the king his famous sermon on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kingdom of Christ,</hi> which was immediately published by royal
                    command. These works were attacks on the divine authority of kings and of the
                    clergy, but as the sermon dealt more specifically and distinctly with the power
                    of the church, its publication caused an ecclesiastical ferment which in certain
                    aspects has no parallel in religious history. It was at once resolved to proceed
                    against him in convocation, but this was prevented by the king proroguing the
                    assembly, a step which had consequences of vital bearing on the history of the
                    church, since from that period the great Anglican council ceased to transact
                    business of a more than formal nature. The restrained sentiments of the council
                    in regard to Hoadly found expression in a war of pamphlets known as the
                    Bangorian controversy, which, partly from a want of clearness in the statements
                    of Hoadly, due perhaps both to his intellectual defects and to a cautious regard
                    to ulterior consequences, partly from the disingenuousness of his opponents and
                    the confusion resulting from exasperated feelings, developed into an intricate
                    and bewildering maze of side discussions in which the main issues of the dispute
                    were concealed almost beyond the possibility of discovery. But however vague and
                    uncertain might be the meaning of Hoadly in regard to several of the important
                    bearings of the questions around which he aroused discussion, he was explicit in
                    denying the power of the church over the conscience, and its right to determine
                    the condition of men in relation to the favour of God. To such an extent was the
                    mind of the religious world exercised on the matters in dispute that in July
                    1717 as many as seventy-four pamphlets made their appearance; and at one period
                    the crisis became so serious that the business of London was for some days
                    virtually at a standstill. Hoadly was translated in 1721 to the see of Hereford,
                    in 1723 to Salisbury, and in 1734 to Winchester. He died at his palace at
                    Chelsea, April 17,1761. Though his writings possess no charm of style, and are
                    not only devoid of originality, but characterized by great prolixity and
                    dulness, they in their own day did important service to the cause of civil and
                    religious liberty, and accidentally he was the occasion of a change in the
                    practical authority of the church which had an influence of prime importance on
                    its after history. He was an intimate friend of Dr Samuel Clarke, of whom he
                    wrote a life.</p>
                <p>The works of Hoadly were collected and published by his son in 3 vols., 1773. To
                    the first volume was prefixed the article “Hoadly,” from the supplement to the
