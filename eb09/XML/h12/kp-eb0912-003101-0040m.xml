                    is said to have got into trouble later on by quarrelling with a rival at the
                    church door, and been forced to decamp, leaving his three children (of whom
                    Thomas was second) to the charitable care of an elder brother, a flourishing
                    glover in Malmesbury. Hobbes was put to school at Westport church at the age of
                    four, passed to the Malmesbury school at eight, and was taught again in Westport
                    later, at a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer, fresh from
                    Oxford and “a good Grecian.” He had begun Latin and Greek early, and under
                    Latimer made such progress as to be able to translate the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medea</hi> of Euripides into Latin iambic verse before he was fourteen. About
                    the age of fifteen he was sent to Oxford by his uncle and entered at Magdalen
                    Hall, which had just been put on an independent footing, after being first a
                    grammar school in connexion with the great foundation of Magdalen College and
                    then governed as a hall by one of the college fellows. While Hobbes was there as
                    a student the first principal of Magdalen Hall, Dr John Hussee, gave way to a
                    second, Dr John Wilkinson, who is noted as having ruled strongly in the interest
                    of the Calvinistic party in the university; and this fact, with other
                    circumstances in the Oxford life of the time, makes it not improbable that the
                    destined foe of the Puritan Revolution was thus early led to mark the aggressive
                    Puritan spirit. For the rest, Oxford did no more to train Hobbes’s mind for his
                    future philosophical work than the decayed scholastic regimen of the
                    universities in that age was able to do for any other of the active spirits that
                    then began in different countries to open the modern era of thought and inquiry.
                    We have from himself a lively record of his experience and pursuits as a student

                    age, may be taken as sufficiently trustworthy. In this he tells how he was set
                    to learn “Barbara, Celarent,” but, when he had slowly taken in the doctrine of
                    figures and moods, he put it aside and would prove things only in his own way;
                    how he then heard about bodies as consisting of matter and form, as throwing off
                    species of themselves for perception, and as moved by sympathies and
                    antipathies, with much else of a like sort,all beyond his comprehension; and how
                    he therefore turned to things more congenial, took up his old books again, fed
                    his mind on maps and charts of earth and sky, traced the sun in his path,
                    followed Drake and Cavendish girdling the main, and gazed with delight upon
                    pictured haunts of men and wonders of unknown lands. Very characteristic in this
                    account is the interest in men and things, and the disposition to cut through
                    questions in the schools after a trenchant fashion of his own. We may also
                    believe that he was little attracted by the scholastic learning, and only should
                    err if we took his words as evidence of a precocious insight into its weakness.
                    The truth probably is that, finding himself left at Oxford very much to his own
                    devices, he took no particular interest in studies which there was no risk in
                    neglecting, and thought as little of rejecting as of accepting the traditional
                    doctrines. He adds that he took his degree at the proper time; but in fact, upon
                    any computation and from whatever cause, he remained at Magdalen Hall five,
                    instead of the required four, years, not being admitted as bachelor till
                    February 5, 1608.</p>
                <p>In the same year, shortly after leaving the university, Hobbes was recommended by
                    Wilkinson as tutor to the son of William Cavendish, baron of Hardwick, and thus
                    began a connexion with a great and powerful family that ended only with his
                    life. Twice it was loosened— once, for a short time, after twenty years, and
                    again, for a longer period, during the Civil War—but it never was broken, and
                    during more than fifty years, to the credit alike of him and his patrons, it was
                    of the closest character. William Cavendish, second son of the famous “Bess of
                    Hardwick” by the second of her four marriages, had just by the favour of King
                    James obtained his barony, before being advanced, a few years later, to the
                    earldom of Devonshire. His son, the heir to a name thus rising as well as to a
                    great fortune, was hardly younger than Hobbes, and was indeed already married, a
                    f e w m onths before, at the instance of the king, who made up the match, to the
                    only daughter of the Scottish Lord Bruce of Kinloss, though by reason of the
                    bride’s age, which was only twelve years, the pair had no establishment for some
                    time to come. In the circumstances Hobbes was companion rather than tutor
                    (before becoming secretary) to young Cavendish; and, growing soon greatly
                    attached to each other, they were sent abroad together on the grand tour in
                    1610. How long they were gone upon this journey, which lay through France,
                    Germany, and Italy, is not known: but it was long enough to give <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n41/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0041-0032"/> Hobbes the opportunity of acquiring a moderate
                    knowledge of French and Italian; and he did not return without having received a
                    distinct mental impulse that had a lasting effect on his life. The real
                    intellectual activity of that time (still more than five and twenty years before
                    the definite inauguration of modern philosophy by Descartes’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourse on Method</hi> in 1637) was in the newly enlarged if not newly opened
                    domain of physical science; and Hobbes was little prepared by his juvenile
                    training to understand the achievements of Galileo and Kepler, if he heard
                    anything of them. But he had had a little modicum of scholastic philosophy
                    retailed to him at Oxford; and now, wherever he went, he could hear nothing but
                    words of scorn poured upon all such learning. How it had come to pass that the
                    scholastic way of thinking, once so dominant, was thus discredited at the hands
                    alike of revolutionary thinkers such as Bruno, of scientific workers like
                    Galileo, and of men of the world like Montaigne, he could not know. Accordingly,
                    it seems that at first he was more dismayed to find that the only knowledge to
                    which he could pretend was laughed at by people whom he did not understand, than
                    pleased to be furnished with such an excuse for his own youthful indifference to
                    its value. It was not long, however, before he yielded to the stream. He was not
                    yet able to strike out a new line of thought, and so (like Descartes) rise above
                    the misconceptions mingled with the general aversion from scholasticism,
                    amounting to a neglect of all philosophy. He had but sufficient force of mind to
                    wish to· be seen, like others, at work upon something else. The line he should
                    take could hardly be doubtful; he had nothing to fall back upon except his Latin
                    and Greek. He was no longer so familiar with them, but it was still open to him
                    to become a scholar; nor in the age of Scaliger and Casaubon was there any lack
                    of ambition in making classical study the occupation of a life. The resolution
                    was made when he returned home, if not earlier, and made in a determined spirit;
                    but when after many years’ labour he had made himself a scholar, his true work
                    was still to lie all before him.</p>
                <p>Hobbes’s period of scholarly acquirement lasted till 1628, and had as its
                    immediate outcome a translation of Thucydides. In Derbyshire or in London, with
                    his young master, he had abundant leisure and easy access to books, and he went
                    carefully through the classical poets and historians, reading critically with
                    the help of commentators, and at the same time bent on acquiring (as if for
                    future use) a good Latin style, clear and easy to read, because fitting words to
                    thoughts. Among all the ancient writers Thucydides attracted him most, and he
                    seems to have set himself early to the work of translation, wishing others to
                    share in the pleasure and instruction he derived from his favourite’s pages. But
                    when he had finished his work he kept it lying by him for years, being no longer
                    so sure of finding appreciative readers; and when he did send it forth at last,
                    in 1628, he was fain to be content with “the few and better sort.”<note

                    Hobbes claims to have performed his work “with much more diligence than
                    elegance,” his version is remarkable as a piece of English writing, but is by no

                    another hand.</p></note> That he was finally determined to pub lication by the
                    political troubles of the year 1628 may be regarded as certain, not only from
                    his own express declaration at a later time (F⅛. <hi rend="italic">carm.
                    exp.},</hi> but also from unmistakable hints in the account of the life and work
                    of his author prefixed to the translation on its appearance. 1628 was the year
                    of the Petition of Right, extorted by the popular leaders from a reluctant king
                    in the third parliament he had tried within three years of his accession; and,
                    in view of Hobbes’s later activity, it is very significant that just then he
                    should come forward, at the mature age of forty, with his version of the
                    impressive story of the Athenian democracy as the first production of his pen.
                    Nothing else is known of his doings before 1628, except that through his
                    connexion with young Cavendish, who from about the year 1619 became an important
                    social and political figure, he had relations with literary men of note like Ben
                    Jonson, and also with the two philosophical thinkers who before himself rendered
                    the English name illustrious in the 17th century—Bacon and Lord Herbert of
                    Cherbury. If he never had any sympathy with Herbert’s intuitionalist principles
                    in philosophy, he was no less eager, as he afterwards showed, than Herbert to
                    rationalize in matters of religious doctrine, so that he may with the same
                    reason be called the second of the English deists as Herbert has been called the
                    first. With Bacon there is evidence of his having been so intimate (Aubrey’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives,</hi> pp. 222, 602) that it is not surprising that some
                    writers have been betrayed into describing him as the disciple and follower of
                    the great Instaurator. The facts as recorded, however,—that he used sometimes to
                    walk with Bacon at Gorhambury, and would jot down with exceptional intelligence
                    the eager thinker’s sudden “notions,” also that he was employed to make the
                    Latin version of some of the <hi rend="italic">Essays,—</hi> prove nothing of
                    the sort, when weighed against his own disregard of all Bacon’s most
                    characteristic principles, and the other evidence that the impulse to
                    independent philosophical thinking came to him not from Bacon, and not till some
                    time after Bacon’s death in 1626.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the faintest reminiscence of the import assigned to it by Bacon; and, as will be

                <p>So far as we have any positive evidence, it was not before the year 1629 that
                    Hobbes first entered on the path of philosophical inquiry; and meanwhile a great
                    change had been wrought in his outer life. His friend and master, after only
                    about two years’ tenure of the earldom, fell a sudden victim to the plague in
                    June 1628; and the affairs of the Devonshire family having become greatly
                    disordered by lavish expenditure, the widowed countess was left with the task of
                    righting them in the boyhood of the third earl. Hobbes went on for a time living
                    in the household; but his services were no longer in demand as before, and,
                    remaining inconsolable under his personal bereavement, he sought distraction, in
                    1629, in another engagement which took him abroad as tutor to the son of Sir
                    Gervase Clifton, of an old Notts family. This, his second, sojourn abroad
                    appears to have been spent chiefly in Paris, and the one important fact recorded
                    of it is that he then first began to look into Euclid. Sojourn and engagement
                    came to an end together in 1631, when he was recalled to train the young earl of
                    Devonshire, now thirteen years old, as he never had had an opportunity of
                    training the boy’s father. In the course of the next <pb break="no"

                    remains the boy’s dictation-book, interspersed with headings, examples, &amp;c.,

                    other subjects. Most probably their life for the first three years was in
                    Derbyshire, till they went abroad in the middle of 1634. They remained away till
                    the spring of 1637, and Hobbes went over much the same ground as in his first
                    journey, but now in a very different frame of mind. His head was now full of the
                    thought of motion in nature, and whenever he could meet with the philosophical
                    speculators or scientific workers who were then with a new-born ardour seeking
                    for a clue to the secret of the physical world, none so forward to consort with
                    them as he. He was still in time to pay his respects to the aged Galileo, for
                    whom he conceived and ever retained the warmest admiration; and on the way
                    homewards he spent no less than eight months in daily converse with the members
                    of a busy scientific circle in Paris, held together by the genial influence of
                    the Père Mersenne. From that time (the winter of 1636-7) he too, as he tells us,
                    was numbered among philosophers.</p>
                <p>It is not impossible to trace a little more exactly the steps by which Hobbes
                    reached this consummation when he was just touching his fiftieth year. There can
                    be no doubt, it seems, that his introduction to Euclid took place in 1629, and
                    according to Aubrey, who tells the story with a quaint dramatic vigour <hi
                    rend="italic">{Lives,</hi> p. 604), the introduction was quite accidental.
                    Euclid’s manner of proof was as a revelation to him, and it became the model for
                    his own way of thinking upon all subjects ever after; nor was he content till he
                    too could be seen at work solving questions of geometry with as much confidence
                    as if he had been, like Descartes, an accomplished mathematician from his
                    boyhood. It is less easy to determine when he awoke to an interest in the
                    physical doctrine of motion. The story told by himself <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Vit.,</hi> p. xx.) is that, being struck one day in a company of learned men
                    by the question, What is sense? which some one asked and nobody could answer, he
                    fell to thinking often on the subject, till it suddenly occurred to him that if
                    bodies and their internal parts were at rest, or were always in the same state
                    of motion, there could be no distinction of anything, and consequently no sense;
                    the cause of all things must, therefore, he presumed, be sought in diversity of
                    movements, and starting from this principle he was driven to geometry for
                    insight into the ground and modes of motion. Unfortunately no date or place is
                    given; but if it may be supposed that he must already have known something of
                    geometry to understand its bearing on the study of motion, the scene or at least
                    the conclusion to which it led should be referred to some time after his casual
                    introduction to Euclid. It is even suggested in one or two of the biographical
                    narratives that the new mental advance was not made till the time of the third
                    journey. Nothing is said, however, which should exclude another account, that on
                    the third journey he began to study the doctrine of motion more seriously, being
                    interested in it before; and as he claims more than once <hi rend="italic">{L.
                    W.,</hi> v. p. 303; <hi rend="italic">E. W.,</hi> vii. p. 468) to have explained
                    light and sound by a mechanical hypothesis as far back as 1630, the
                    company-scene (which is more likely to have occurred abroad than in England) and
                    the sudden inspiration may perhaps more safely be assigned to the time of the
                    second journey. But it was not till the third journey that the new interest
                    became an overpowering passion, and the “philosopher” was on his way home before
                    he had advanced so far as to conceive the scheme of a system of thought to the
                    elaboration of which his life should henceforth be devoted.</p>
                <p>Hobbes was able to carry out his plan in some twenty years or more from the time
                    of its conception, but the execution was so broken in upon by the dire political
                    events that happened from the year 1637, and became so complicated with other
                    labours, that its stages can hardly be followed without some previous
                    understanding of the relations of the parts of the scheme, as there is reason to
                    believe they were sketched out from the beginning. And there is the more need
                    for some preliminary statement because at least one of the parts—the doctrine of
                    Sian—is far more effectively wrought out in other works than in the treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Homine,</hi> which professes to contain
                    the formal exposition of it. Hobbes’s notion was that the whole body of
                    philosophical truth should be disposed in three sections, dealing progressively
                    with Body, Man, and State or Society. An anxious political observer before he
                    became a philosopher, he was supremely interested in the problem of con duct;
                    but the philosopher could not be satisfied till the foundations of settled
                    social life were based deep in the constitution of human nature; and his new
                    philosophical insight revealed to him the need and the possibility of
                    interpreting the facts of human nature by what had begun to be known of physical
                    nature generally. He would therefore first work out, in a separate treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Corporc,</hi> a systematic doctrine of Body, showing how
                    physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, as motion or
                    mechanical action was now (through Galileo and others) understood, —the theory
                    of motion being applied in the light of mathematical science, after quantity,
                    the subject-matter of mathematics, had been duly considered in its place among
                    the fundamental conceptions of philosophy, and a clear indication had been
                    given, at first starting, of the logical ground and method of all philosophical
                    inquiry. He would then single out Man from the realm ol nature, and, in a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Hornine,</hi> show what specific bodily motions
                    were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation and
                    knowledge, as also of the affections and passions thence resulting, whereby man
                    came into relation with man. Finally he would consider, in a crowning treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De Civc,</hi> how men, being naturally rivals or foes, were
                    moved to enter into the better relation of Society, and demonstrate how this
                    grand and beneficent product of human wit must be regulated if men were not to
                    fall back into brutishness and misery. Such, in briefest summary, was the scheme
                    conceived, at a time of new intellectual expansion, with reference to a
                    threatening movement of social upheaval. We are now to see how it fared in the
                    execution.</p>
                <p>Hobbes came home, in 1637, to a country seething with discontent. The reign of
                    “Thorough” was collapsing, and the forces pent up since 1629 were soon to rend
                    the fabric of the English state to pieces. In February Hampden’s case began to
                    be tried; in July broke out the Edinburgh riot over Laud’s prayer-book; next
                    year was formed the Solemn League and Covenant; the year after the rebel Scots
                    had the king at their mercy in the open field; and finally, in the spring of
                    1640, with a new prospect of war, Charles had no resource left but once more,
                    after eleven years of personal rule, to call a parliament. Such a rush of events
                    was but too likely to overpower Hobbes’s resolution to work up to social
                    problems from abstract questions of body and space and motion, and there is
                    clear evidence that he was soon distracted from the orderly execution of his
                    philosophic plan. The Short Parliament, as he tells us himself at a later time
                    <hi rend="italic">{E.</hi> IK., iv. p. 414), was not dissolved, in three weeks
                    from the time of its meeting, before he had ready “a little treatise in
                    English,” in which he sought to prove that the points of the royal prerogative
                    which the members were determined to dispute before granting supplies, “were
                    inseparably annexed to the sovereignty which they did not then deny to be in the
                    king.” Now it can be proved that at this time he had written not only his <hi
                    rend="italic">Human Nature</hi> but also his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Corpore</hi><hi rend="italic">Politico,</hi> the two treatises,
                    though published separately ten years later, having been composed as parts of
                    one work;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among the
                    Hardwick papers there is preserved a MS. copy of the work, under the title <hi

                    earl of Newcastle, written in Hobbes’s own hand, and dated May 9, 1640. This
                    dedication was prefixed to the first thirteen chapters of the work when printed
                    by themselves, under the title <hi rend="italic">Human Nature,</hi> in
                    1650.</p></note> and there cannot be the least question that together they make
                    “the little treatise” just mentioned. We are therefore to understand, first,
                    that he wrote the earliest draft of his political theory some years before the
                    outbreak of the Civil War, and, secondly, that this earliest draft was not
                    written till, in accordance with his philosophical conception, he had
                    established the grounds of polity in human nature. The first point is to be
                    noted, because it has often been supposed that Hobbes’s political doctrine took
                    its peculiar complexion from his revulsion against the state of anarchy before
                    his eyes, as lie wrote during the progress of the Civil War. The second point
                    must be maintained against his own implied, if not express, statement some years
                    later, when publishing his <hi rend="italic">De Cive (L. W.,</hi> ii. p. 151),
                    that he wrote this third part of his system before he had <pb break="no"

                    of the fundamental doctrines which it presupposed. If his philosophical plans
                    were disordered and the doctrine of Body was still in the air, he had, in the
                    beginning of 1640, written out his doctrine of Man at least, with almost as much
                    elaboration as it ever received from him.</p>
                <p>When, in six months more, the Long Parliament succeeded to the Short, and set to
                    work at once by sending Laud and Strafford to the Tower, Hobbes, who had become,
                    or thought he had become, a marked man by the circulation of his treatise (of
                    which, “though not printed, many gentlemen had copies ”), instantly took fright
                    and hasted away to Paris. He was now for the fourth and last time abroad, and
                    did not see England again for eleven years. Apparently he remained the greater
                    part of the time in or about Paris, though he can be traced to Rouen in 1646. In
                    Paris he was welcomed back into the old scientific coterie about Mersenne, and
                    forthwith had the task assigned him of criticizing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditations</hi> of Descartes, which had been sent from Holland, before
                    publication, to Mersenne with the author’s request for criticism from the most
                    different points of view. Hobbes was soon ready with the remarks that were
                    printed as “Third” among the six (later seven) sets of “Objections” appended,
                    with “Replies” from Descartes, to the <hi rend="italic">Meditations,</hi> when
                    published shortly afterwards in 1641 (reprinted in <hi rend="italic">L. JV.,
                    v.</hi> pp. 249-74). About the same time also Mersenne sent to Descartes, as if
                    they came from a friend in England, another set of objections which Hobbes had
                    to offer on various points in the scientific treatises, especially the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> appended by Descartes to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourse on Method</hi> in 1637; to which Descartes replied without suspecting
                    the common authorship of the two sets. The result in both cases was to keep the
                    two thinkers apart rather than bring them together. Hobbes was more eager to
                    bring forward his own philosophical and physical ideas, over which he had now
                    been brooding for ten years, than careful to enter into the full meaning of
                    another’s thought; and Descartes was by nature too jealous, and had become too
                    confident in his hard-won conclusions, to be able to bear with this kind of
                    criticism. He was very curt in his replies to Hobbes’s philosophical objections,
                    and after a little impatiently broke off all correspondence on the physical
                    questions, writing privately to Mersenne (who had continued to act as
                    intermediary) that he had grave doubts of the Englishman’s good faith in drawing
                    him into controversy (Z. <hi rend="italic">JV., v.</hi> pp. 277-307).</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Hobbes, however eager he might be to keep himself abreast of the
                    general philosophical movement of the time, had his thoughts too full of the
                    political theory which the rush of events in the last years had ripened within
                    him, to be able to settle, even in Paris, to the orderly composition of his
                    systematic works. Though connected in his own mind with his view of human nature
                    and of nature generally, the political theory, as he always declared, could
                    stand by itself. Also, while he may have hoped at this time to be able to add
                    much (though he never did add much) to the first popular sketch of his doctrine
                    of Man contained in the unpublished “little treatise,” he might extend, but
                    could hardly otherwise modify, the sketch he had there given of his carefully
                    articulated theory of Body Politic. Possibly, indeed, before that sketch was
                    written early in 1640, he may, under pressure of the political excitement, have
                    advanced no small way in the actual composition of the treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Cive,</hi> the third section of his projected system. In any
                    case, it was upon this section, before the others, that he set to work as soon
                    as he was fixed in Paris; and before the end of 1641 the book, as we know from
                    the date of the dedication (November 1), was finished. He determined, however,
                    though it was forthwith printed in the course of the year 1642, not to commit
                    himself to formal publication, but was content to circulate a limited number of
                    copies privately;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    book, of which the copies are rare (one in Dr Williams’s library in London), was
                    printed in quarto size (Paris, 1642.), with a pictorial title-page (not
                    afterwards reproduced) of scenes and figures illustrating its three divisions,

                    his friends (it was praised even by Descartes), he seems to have taken this
                    recognition of his philosophical achievement as but a reason the more for
                    deferring publication till the earlier works of the system were completed.
                    Accordingly, for the next three or four years, he remained steadily at work, and
                    nothing appeared from him in public except a short treatise on optics <hi
                    rend="italic">{Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">Opticus, L. W.,</hi> v. pp.
                    217-248) included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Coyitata Physicο-Mathematica</hi> in 1644, and
                    a highly compressed statemeut of his psychological application of the doctrine

                    Mersennes <hi rend="italic">Ballistica,</hi> published in the same year. Thus or
                    otherwise he had become sufficiently known by 1645 to be chosen, with Descartes,
                    Roberval, and others, a referee in a once famous controversy between Pell, an
                    English mathematician in Amsterdam, and the Dane Longomontanus, over that
                    problem of the quadrature of the circle which was seeu later on to have such a
                    fatal charm for himself. But though about this time he had got ready all or most
                    of the materials for his fundamental work on Body, not even now was he able to
                    make way with its composition. New distractions came to tear him away from the
                    orderly execution of the fundamental part of his scheme, and when he returned to
                    it after a number of years, he returned a different man.</p>
                <p>The Civil War had broken out in the middle of 1642, and, after a period of
                    varying fortunes on either side, the royalist cause began to decline from the
                    time of the defeat of the marquis of Newcastle at Marston Moor, in the middle of
                    1644. Then commenced an exodus of the king’s friends. Newcastle himself, a
                    cousin of Hobbes’s dead master and the patron to whom he dedicated the “little
                    treatise” of 1640, found his way to Paris, and was followed, especially after
                    the decisive defeat at Naseby in June 1645, by an ever increasing stream of
                    fugitives, many of whom were known to Hobbes from former days. The sight of
                    these exiles, from whom he learned all the details of the fierce work that had
                    been going on in England while he was quietly busy with his studies in Paris,
                    made the political interest once more predominant in Hobbes, and before long the
                    revived feeling issued in the formation· of a new and important design. It first
                    showed itself in the publication of the <hi rend="italic">De Give,</hi> of which
                    the fame, but only the fame, had extended beyond the inner circle of friends and
                    critics who had copies of the original impression. Hobbes now entrusted it,
                    early in 1646, to his admirer, the Frenchman Sorbière, by -whom it was seen
                    through the Elzevir press at Amsterdam in 1647,—having previously inserted a
                    number of notes in reply to objections, and also a striking preface, in the
                    course of which he explained its relation to the other parts of the system not
                    yet forthcoming, and the (political) occasion of its having been composed and
                    being now published before them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    admirers and most frequent correspondents in later years; there are many of his
                    letters among Hobbes’s papers at Hardwick.</p></note> when he was induced to
                    remain as mathematical instructor to the young prince of Wales, who had come
                    over from Jersey about the month of July. Thus thrown more than ever into the
                    company of the exiled royalists, it was then, if not earlier, that he conceived
                    his new design of bringing ull his powers of thought and expression to bear upon
                    the production of an English book that should set forth his whole theory of
                    civil government in relation to the stupendous political crisis resulting from
                    the war. The <hi rend="italic">De Give,</hi> presently to be published, was
                    written in Latin for the learned, and gave the political theory without its
                    foundation in human nature. The unpublished treatise of 1640 contained all or
                    nearly all that lie had to tell concerning human nature, but was written before
                    the terrible events of the last years had disclosed how men might still be urged
                    by their anti-social passions back into the abyss of anarchy. There was need of
                    an exposition at once comprehensive, incisive, and popular. Tiιe State, it now
                    seemed to Hobbes, might be regarded as a great artificial man or monster <hi
                    rend="italic">(Leviathan),</hi> composed of men, with a life that might be
                    traced from its generation through human reason under pressure of human needs to
                    its dissolution through civil strife proceeding from human passions. This, we
                    may suppose, was the presiding conception from the first, but the design may
                    have been variously modified in the three or four years of its execution. Before
                    the end, in 1650-1, it is plain that he wrote in direct reference to the greatly
                    changed aspect of affairs in England. The king being no more, and the royalist
                    cause appearing to be hopelessly lost, he did not scruple, in closing the work
                    with a general “Review and Conclusion,” to raise the question of the subject’s
                    right to change allegiance when a former sovereign’s power to protect was
                    irrecoverably gone. Also he took advantage of the lax rule of the Commonwealth
                    to indulge much more freely than he might have otherwise dared in rationalistic
                    criticism of religious doctrines; while, amid the turmoil of sects, he could the
                    more forcibly urge that the preservation of social order, when again firmly
                    restored, must depend on the assumption by the civil power of the right to wield
                    all sanctions, supernatural as well as natural, against the pretensions of any
                    clergy, Catholic, Anglican, or Presbyterian, to the exercise of an <hi

                    During the years of its composition he remained in or near Paris, at first in
                    attendance on his royal pupil, with whom he became a great favourite. The
                    engagement must in any case have come to an end in the year 1648, when the
                    prince removed to Holland, but it was probably broken off earlier by an illness
                    that overtook Hobbes in 1647 and disabled him for six months. On recovering from
                    this illness, which nearly proved fatal, he resumed his literary task, and
                    carried it steadily forward to completion by the year 1650, having also within
                    the same time translated into English, with characteristic force of expression,
                    his Latin treatise. Otherwise the only thing known (from one or two letters) of
                    his life in those years is that from the year 1648 he had begun to think of
                    returning home; he was then sixty, and might well be weary of exile. When 1650

                    same year, 1651, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Leviathan, or the Matter,
                    Form, and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil (E. W.,</hi> iii.),
                    with a quaint frontispiece in which, from behind hills overlooking a fair
                    landscape of town and country, there towered the body (above the waist) of a
                    crowned giant, made up of tiny figures of human beings and bearing sword and
                    crozier in the two hands. It appeared, and soon its author was more lauded and
                    decried than any other thinker of his time; but the first effect of its
                    publication was to sever his connexion with the exiled royalist party, and to
                    throw him for protection on the revolutionary Government. No sooner did copies
                    of the book reach Paris than he found himself shunned by his former associates,
                    and though he was himself so little conscious of disloyalty that he was forward

                    of the Scots (who, after the defeat at Worcester, escaped to Paris about the end
                    of October), he was denied the royal presence when he sought it shortly
                    afterwards. Straightway, then, he saw himself exposed to a double peril. The
                    exiles had among them desperadoes who could slay; and, besides exciting the
                    enmity of the Anglican clergy about the king, who bitterly resented the
                    secularist spirit of his book, he had compromised himself with the French
                    authorities by his elaborate attack on the papal system. In the circumstances,
                    no resource; was left him but secret flight. Travelling with what speed he could
                    in the depths of a severe winter and under the effects of a recent (second)
                    illness, he managed to reach London, where, sending in his submission to the
                    council of state, he was allowed without trouble to subside into private
                    life.</p>
                <p>Though Hobbes came back, after his eleven years’ absence, without having as yet
                    publicly proved his title to rank with the natural philosophers of the age, he
                    was sufficiently conscious of what he had been able to achieve in <hi
                    rend="italic">Leviathan;</hi> and it was in no humble mood that he now, at the
                    age of sixty-four, turned to complete the fundamental treatise of his
                    philosophical system. Neither were those whom his masterpiece soon roused to
                    enthusiasm, or those whom it moved to indignation, likely to be indifferent to
                    anything he should now write, whether it lay near to or far from the region of
                    practice. Taking up his abode in London on his return, and continuing to reside
                    there for the sake of intellectual society, even after renewing his old ties

                    they remained in steady correspondence. The earl, having sided with the king in
                    1642, was declared unfit to sit in the House of Peers, and though, by submission
                    to Parliament, he recovered his estates when they were sequestered later on, he
                    did not sit again till 1660. Among Hobbes’s friends at this time are specially
                    mentioned Selden and Harvey, who each left him a legacy of £10 on dying, Selden
                    in 1654 and Harvey in 1657. Harvey (not Bacon) is the only Englishman he

                    >Leviathan</hi> had a different excitement. In 1654 a small treatise, <hi
                    rend="italic">Of Liberty and Necessity (E.</hi> JK,iv. pp. 229-278), issued from
                    the press, claiming to be an answer to a discourse on the same subject by Bishop
                    Bramhall of Londonderry, addressed by Hobbes to the marquis of Newcastle.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The treatise bore the date,
                    “Rouen, Aug. 20, 1652,” but it should have been 1646, as afterwards explained by
                    Hobbes himself <hi rend="italic">(E.W.,</hi> V. p. 25).</p></note> It was really
                    such, and had grown out of an oral discussion between Hobbes and Bramhall in the
                    marquis’s presence at Paris in 1646,—Bramhall, a strong Arminian, having
                    afterwards written down his views and sent them to Newcastle to be answered in
                    this form by Hobbes, and Hobbes having duly replied, but not for publication,
                    because he thought the subject a delicate one. Unpublished, accordingly, the
                    piece remained; but it happened that Hobbes, in the interval between writing his
                    own reply and receiving from the bishop in 1647 a rejoinder which he left
                    unanswered, allowed a French acquaintance to have a private translation of his
                    reply made by a young Englishman, who secretly took also a copy of the original
                    for himself; and now it was this unnamed purloiner who, in 1654, when Hobbes had
                    become famous and feared, gave it to the world of his own motion, with an
                    extravagantly laudatory epistle to the reader in its front. Upon Hobbes himself
                    the publication came as a surprise, but, after his plain speaking in <hi
                    rend="italic">Leviathan,</hi> there was nothing in the piece that he need
                    scruple to have made known, and he seems to have readily enough condoned the
                    offender’s act. On the other hand, Bramhall, supposing Hobbes privy to the
                    publication, might well resent the manner of it, especially as no mention was
                    made of his rejoinder. Accordingly, in 1655, he printed everything that had
                    passed between them (under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Defence of the True
                    Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity),</hi> with loud
                    complaint against the treatment he had received, and the promise added that, in
                    default of others, he himself would stand forward to expose the deadly
                    principles of <hi rend="italic">Leviathan.</hi> About this time Hobbes had begun
                    to be hard pressed by other foes, and, being never more sure of himself than
                    upon the question of the will, he appears to have welcomed the opportunity thus
                    given him of showing his strength. By 1656 he was ready with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance (E. W.,</hi>
                    v.), in which he replied with astonishing force to the bishop’s rejoinder point
                    by point, besides explaining the occasion and circumstances of the whole debate,
                    and reproducing (as Bramhall had done) all the pieces from the beginning. As
                    perhaps the first clear exposition and defence of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >psychological</hi> doctrine of determinism, Hobbes’s own two pieces must ever
                    retain a classical importance in the history of the freewill controversy; while
                    Bramhall’s are still worth study as specimens of scholastic fence. The bishop,
                    it should be added, returned to the charge in 1658 with ponderous <hi
                    rend="italic">Castigations of Hobbeds Animadversions,</hi> and also made good
                    his previous threat in a bulky appendix entitled <hi rend="italic">The Catching
                    of Leviathan the Great Whale.</hi> Hobbes never took any notice of the <hi

                <p>We may now follow out the more troublesome conflict, or rather series of
                    conflicts, in which Hobbes became entangled from the time of publishing his De
                    <hi rend="italic">Corpore</hi> in 1655, and which checkered all his remaining
                    years. In <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> he had vehemently assailed the system
                    of the universities, as originally founded for the support of the papal against
                    the civil authority, and as still working social mischief by adherence to the
                    old learning. The attack was duly noted at Oxford, where under the Commonwealth
                    a new spirit of scientific activity had begun to stir; and in 1654 Seth Ward,
                    the Savilian professor of astronomy, replying in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vindiciae</hi><hi rend="italic">Academiarum</hi> to some other assaults (then
                    very common) on the academic system, retorted upon Hobbes that, so far from the
                    universities being now what he had known them in his youth, he would find his
                    geometrical pieces, tvhen they appeared, better understood there than he should
                    like. This was said in reference to the boasts in which Hobbes seems to have
                    been freely indulging of having squared the circle and accomplished other such
                    feats; and, when a year later the <hi rend="italic">Be Cotpore (L. W.</hi>, i. )
                    finally appeared, it was seen how the thrust had gone home. In the chapter (xx.)
                    of that work where Hobbes dealt with the famous problem whose solution he fondly
                    thought he had found, there were left some self-complacent expressions vented
                    against Vindex (Ward) at a time when the solutions still seemed to him good; but
                    the solutions themselves, as printed, were allowed to be all in different ways
                    halting, as he naively confessed he had discovered only when he had been driven
                    by the insults of malevolent men to examine them more closely with the help of
                    his friends. A strange conclusion this, and reached by a path not less strange,
                    as was now to be disclosed by a relentless hand. Ward’s colleague, the more
                    famous John Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry, had been privy to the
                    challenge thrown out in 1654, and it was arranged that they should critically
                    dispose of the <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Corpore</hi> between
                    them. Ward was to occupy himself with the philosophical and physical sections,
                    which he did in leisurely fashion, bringing out his criticism in the course of
                    next year <hi rend="italic">{In Th. Ηobbii</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophiam
                    Exercitatio Epistolica).</hi> Wallis was to confine himself to the mathematical
                    chapters, and set to tvork at once with characteristic energy. Obtaining an
                    unbound copy of the <hi rend="italic">Be Cotpore,</hi> he saw by the mutilated
                    appearance of the sheets that Hobbes had repeatedly altered his demonstrations
                    before he issued them at last in their actual form, grotesque as it was, rather
                    than delay the book longer. Obtaining also a copy of the work as it had been
                    printed before Hobbes had any doubt of the validity of his solutions, Wallis was
                    able to track his whole course from the time of Ward’s provocation—his passage
                    from exultation to doubt, from doubt to confessed impotence, yet still without
                    abandoning the old assumption of confident strength; and all Ids turnings and
                    windings were now laid bare in one of the most trenchant pieces of controversial
                    writing ever penned. Wallis’s <hi rend="italic">Elenchus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometries</hi><hi rend="italic">Hobbianoe,</hi> published in 1655 about three
                    months after the <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Corpore,</hi>
                    contained also an elaborate criticism of Hobbes’s whole attempt to relay the
                    foundations of mathematical science in its place within the general body of
                    reasoned knowledge—a criticism which, if it failed to allow for the merit of the
                    conception, exposed only too effectually the utter inadequacy of the result.
                    Taking up mathematics when not only his mind was already formed but his thoughts
                    were crystallizing into a philosophical system, Hobbes had, in fact, never put
                    himself to school and sought to work up gradually to the best knowledge of the
                    time, but had been more anxious from the first to become himself an innovator
                    with whatever insufficient means. The consequence was that, when not spending
                    himself in vain attempts to solve the impossible problems that have always
                    waylaid the fancy of self-sufficient beginners, he took an interest only in the
                    elements of geometry, and never had any notion of the full scope of mathematical
                    science, undergoing as it then was (and not least at the hands of Wallis) the
                    extraordinary development which made it before the end of the century the potent
                    instrument of physical discovery which it became in the hands of Newton. He xvas
                    even unable, in dealing with the elementary conceptions of geometιy, to work out
                    with any consistency the few original thoughts he had, and thus became the easy
                    sport of Wallis. At his advanced age, however, and with the sense he had of his
                    powers, he was not likely tö be brought to a better mind by so insulting an
                    opponent. He did indeed, before allowing an English translation of the <hi

                    exposed by Wallis, and, while leaving out all the references to Vindex, now
                    profess to make, in altered form, a series of mere “attempts” at quadrature; hut
                    he was far from yielding the ground to the enemy. With the translation,<note

                    geometry in opposition to Euclid’s, he proceeded to repel Wallis’s objections
                    with no lack of dialectical skill, and with an unreserve equal to Wallis’s own.
                    He did not scruple, in the ardour of conflict, even to maintain positions that
                    he had resigned in the translation, and he was not afraid to assume the
                    offensive by a counter criticism of three of Wallis’s works then published. When
                    he had thus disposed of the “Paralogisms” of his more formidable antagonist in
                    the first five lessons, he ended with a lesson on “Manners” to the two
                    professors together, and set himself gravely at the close to show that he too
                    could be abusive. In this particular part of his task, it must be allowed, he
                    succeeded very well; his criticism of Wallis’s works, especially the great
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Infinitorum</hi> (1655), only showed how
                    little able he was to enter into the meaning of the modern analysis. Wallis, on
                    his side, was not less ready to keep up the game in English than he had been to
                    begin it in Latin. Swift as before to strike, in three months’ time he had
                    deftly turned his own word against the would-be master by administering <hi
                    rend="italic">Due Correction for Mr Hobbes, or School Discipline for not saying

                    >Elenchus</hi> only in being more biting and unrestrained. Having an easy task
                    in defending himself against Hobbes’s trivial criticism, he seized the
                    opportunity given him by the English translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Corpore</hi> to track Hobbes again step by step over
                    the whole course, and now to confront him with his incredible inconsistencies
                    multiplied by every new utterance. But it was no longer a fight over
                    mathematical questions only. Wallis having been betrayed originally by his fatal
                    cleverness into the pettiest carping at words, Hobbes had retorted in kind, and
                    then it became a high duty in the other to defend his Latin with great parade of
                    learning and give fresh provocation. One of Wallis s rough sallies in this kind
                    suggested to Hobbes the title of the next rejoinder with which, in 1657, he
                    sought to close the unseemly wrangle. Arguing in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lessons</hi> that a mathematical point must have quantity, though this were not
                    reckoned, he had explained the Greek word <hi rend="italic">στlyμη,</hi> used
                    for a point, to mean a visible mark made with a hot iron; whereupon he was
                    charged by Wallis with gross ignorance for confounding <hi rend="italic"
                    >στιyμh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">στiyμa.</hi> Hence the title of his new piece
                    :— <hi rend="italic">2τιyμai</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ayeωμeτρias,</hi> ’ <hi

                    357-400). He now attacked more in detail but not more happily than before
                    Wallis’s great work, while hardly attempting any further defence of his own
                    positions; also he repelled with some force and dignity the insults that had
                    been heaped upon him, and fought the verbal points, but could not leave the
                    field without making political insinuations against his adversary, quite
                    irrelevant in themselves and only noteworthy as evidence of his own resignation
                    to Cromwell’s rule. The thrusts were easily and nimbly parried by Wallis in a

                    not avail to shake Hobbes’s determination to remain silent; and thus at last
                    there was peace for a time.</p>
                <p>Before the strife flamed up again, Hobbes had published, in 1658, the outstanding
                    section of his philosophical system, and thus completed, after a fashion, the
                    scheme he had planned more than twenty years before. So far as the treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Homine</hi><hi rend="italic">(L. W.,</hi>
                    ii. pp. 1-132) was concerned, the completion was more in name than in fact. It
                    consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision which, though very
                    creditable to Hobbes’s scientific insight, was out of place, or at least out of
                    proportion, in a philosophical consideration of human nature generally. The
                    remainder of the treatise, dealing cursorily with some of the topics more fully
                    treated in the <hi rend="italic">Human Nature</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leviathan,</hi> has all the appearance of having been tagged in haste to the

                    Molesworth otherwise prints the dedication to the marquis of Newcastle, and the

                    makeshift for the proper transition required in the system from questions of
                    Body Natural to questions of Body Politic. Hobbes had in fact spent himself in
                    his earlier constructive efforts, and at the age of seventy, having nothing to
                    add to his doctrine of Man as it was already in one form or another before the
                    world, was content with anything that might stand for the fulfilment of his
                    philosophical purpose. But he had still in him more than twenty years of
                    vigorous vitality, and, not conscious to himself of any shortcoming, looked
                    forward, now his hands were free, to doing battle for his doctrines. Rather than
                    remain quiet, on finding no notice taken of his latest production, he would
                    himself force on a new conflict with the enemy. Wallis having meanwhile
                    published other works and especially a comprehensive treatise on the general
                    prinβiples of calculus <hi rend="italic">(Mathesis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Universalis,</hi> 1657), he might take this occasion of exposing afresh the
                    new-fangled methods of mathematical analysis and reasserting his own earlier
                    positions. Accordingly, by the spring of 1660, he had managed to put his
                    criticism and assertions into five dialogues under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Examinatio et Emendatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematicce</hi><hi

                    circle, forty-six in number (shattered by Wallis in 1662), were omitted by
                    Hobbes when he republished the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> in 1668, in the
                    collected edition of his Latin works from which Molesworth reprints. In the part
                    omitted, at p. 154 of the original edition, Hobbes refers to his first
                    introduction to Euclid, in a way that confirms the story in Aubrey quoted in an
                    earlier paragraph.</p></note> Wallis, however, would not take the bait. Hobbes
                    then tried another tack. Next year, having solved, as he thought, another
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">crux,</hi> the duplication of the cube, he had his
                    solution brought out anonymously at Paris in French, so as to put Wallis and
                    other critics off the scent and extort a judgment that might be withheld from a
                    work of his. The artifice was successful, and no sooner had Wallis publicly
                    refuted the solution than Hobbes claimed the credit of it, and went more
                    wonderfully than ever astray in its defence. He presently republished it (in
                    modified form), with his remarks, at the end of a new Latin dialogue which he
                    had meanwhile written in defence of another part of his philosophical doctrine.
                    This was the <hi rend="italic">Dialogus Physicus, sive</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    as the Royal Society in 1662) for experimental research, to the exclusion of
                    himself personally, and in direct contravention of the method of physical

                    least warrant, to take as the manifesto of the new “academicians,” seemed to him
                    only to confirm the conclusions he had reasoned out years before from
                    speculative principles, and he warned them that if they were not content to
                    begin where he had left off their work would come to nought. To as much of this
                    diatribe as concerned himself Boyle quickly replied with force and dignity, but
                    it was from Hobbes’s old enemy that retribution came, in the scathing satire <hi
                    rend="italic">Hobbiιιs Heauton·timorumenos</hi> (1662). Wallis, who had deftly
                    steered his course amid all the political changes of the previous years,
                    managing ever to be on the side of the ruling power, was now apparently stung to
                    fury by a wanton allusion in Hobbes’s latest dialogue to a passage of his former
                    life (his deciphering for the Parliament the king s papers taken at.Naseby),
                    whereof he had once boasted but after the Restoration could not speak or hear
                    too little. The revenge he took was crashing. Professing to be roused by the
                    attack on his friend Boyle, when he had scorned to lift a finger in defence of
                    himself against the earlier dialogues, he tore them all to shreds with an art of
                    which no general description can give an idea. He got, however, upon more
                    dangerous ground when, passing wholly by the political insinuation against
                    himself, he roundly charged Hobbes with having written <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leviathan</hi> in support of Oliver’s title, and deserted his royal master in
                    distress. Hobbes seems to have been fairly bewildered by the rush and whirl of
                    sarcasm .with which Wallis drove him anew from every mathematical position he
                    had ever taken up, and did not venture forth into the field of scientific
                    controversy again for some years, when he had once followed up the physical
                    dialogue of 1661 by seven shorter ones, with the inevitable appendix, entitled

                    of Thomas Hobbes (E. W.,</hi> iv. pp. 409-440). In this piece which is of great
                    biographical value, he told his own and Wallis’s “little stories during the time
                    of the late rebellion” with such effect that Wallis, like a wise man, attempted
                    no further reply. Thus ended the second bout.</p>
                <p>After a time Hobbes took heart again and began a third period of controversial
                    activity, which did riot end, on his side, till his ninetieth year. Little need
                    be added to the simple catalogue of the untiring old man’s labours in this last
                    stage of his life. The first piece, published in 1666, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Principiis et Ratiocinatione Geometrarum (L. W.,</hi>
                    iv. pp. 385-484), was designed, as the sub-title declared, to lower the pride of
                    geometrical professors by showing that there was no less uncertainty and error
                    in their works than in those of physical or ethical writers. Wallis replied
                    shortly in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (August, 1666).
                    Three years later he brought his three great achievements together in
                    compendious form, <hi rend="italic">Q,uadratu,ra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Circuli,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cuba&gt;io</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sphoeroe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Duplicatio Cubi,</hi> and as soon as they were
                    once more refuted by Wallis, reprinted them with an answer to the objections, in
                    compliment to the grand-duke of Tuscany, who paid him attentions on a visit to
                    England in 1669 (2λ <hi rend="italic">W.,</hi> iv. pp. 485-522). Wallis, who had
                    promised to leave him alone henceforward, refuted him again before the year was
                    out. In 1671 he worked up his propositions over again in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rosetum Geometricum</hi><hi rend="italic">(L.W.,</hi> V. pp. 1-50), as a
                    fragrant offering to the geometrical reader, appending a criticism <hi
                    rend="italic">(Censura</hi><hi rend="italic">brevis,</hi> pp. 50-88) on the
                    first part of Wallis’s treatise <hi rend="italic">De Motu,</hi> published in
                    1669; also he sent <hi rend="italic">Three Papers</hi> to the Royal Society on
                    selected points treated very briefly, and when Wallis, still not weary of
                    confuting, shortly replied, published them separately with triumphant <hi

                    pp. 429-448). Next year, 1672, having now, as he believed, established himself
                    with the Royal Society, he proceeded to complete the discomfiture of Wallis by a
                    public address to the Society on all the points at issue between them from the
                    beginning, <hi rend="italic">Lux</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematica excussa

                    (Roseti Repertor) added, being here “increased by many very brilliant rays.”
                    Wallis replied in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> and then finally held
                    his hand. Hobbes’s energy was not yet exhausted. In 1674, at the age of
                    eighty-six, he published his <hi rend="italic">Principia et Problemata</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aliquot</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometrica,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >W.,</hi> v. pp. 150-214), containing in the chapters dealing with questions of
                    principle not a few striking observations, which ought not to be overlooked in
                    the study of his philosophy. His last piece of all, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiologicum</hi><hi rend="italic">(E.
                    W.,</hi> vii. pp. 69-180), in 1678, was a new set of dialogues on physical
                    questions, most of which he had treated in a similar fashion before; but now, in
                    dealing with gravitation, he was able to fire a parting shot at Wallis; and one
                    more demonstration of the equality of a straight line to the arc of a circle,
                    thrown in at the end, appropriately closed the strangest warfare in which
                    perverse thinker ever engaged.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>We must now turn back to trace the fortunes of Hobbes and his other doings in the
                    last twenty years of his life. All these controversial writings on mathematics
                    and physics represent but one half of his activity after the age of seventy;
                    though, as regards the other half, it is not possible, for a reason that will be
                    seen, to say as definitely in what order the works belonging to the period were
                    produced. From the time of the Restoration he acquired a new prominence in the
                    public eye. No year had passed since the appearance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leviathan</hi> without some indignant protest against the influence which its
                    trenchant doctrine was calculated to produce upon minds longing above everything
                    for civil repose; but it was not until the old political order was set up again
                    that “Hobbism” became a fashionable creed, which it was the duty of every lover
                    of true morality and religion to denounce. Friends and foes alike were impressed
                    by the king’s behaviour to the aged philosopher. Two or three days after
                    Charles’s arrival in London, Hobbes, who had come up to town from spending the
                    previous winter in Derbyshire, drew in the street the notice of his former
                    pupil, and was at once received into favour. The young king, if he had ever
                    himself resented the apparent disloyalty of the “Conclusion” of <hi
                    rend="italic">Leviathan,</hi> had not retained the feeling long, and could well
                    enough appreciate the principles of the great book when the application of them
                    happened, as now, to be turned in his own favour. He had, besides, from of old a
                    relish for Hobbes’s lively wit, and did not like the old man the less because
                    his presence at court scandalized the bishops or the prim virtue of Chancellor
                    Hyde. He even went the length of bestowing on Hobbes (but not always paying) a
                    yearly pension of £100, and had his portrait hung up in the royal closet. These
                    marks of favour, naturally, did not lessen Hobbes’s self-esteem, and perhaps
                    they explain, in his later writings, a certain slavishness of feeling toward the
                    regal authority, which is wholly absent from his rational demonstration of
                    absolutism in the earlier works. At all events Hobbes remained very well
                    satisfied with the rule of a king who had the sense to appreciate the author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Leviathan,</hi> and to protect him, when after a time
                    protection in a very real sense became necessary. His eagerness to defend
                    himself against Wallis’s imputation of disloyalty, and his apologetic dedication
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Problemata Physica</hi> to the king, are evidence of
                    the hostility with which he was being pressed as early as 1662; but it was not
                    till 1666 that he felt himself seriously in danger. In that year the Great Fire
                    of London, following in ominous succession on theGreat Plague of the year
                    before, roused the superstitious fears and intolerant passions of the people,
                    and the House of Commons embodied the general feeling in a bill against atheism
                    and profaneness. On the 17th October it was ordered that the committee to which
                    the bill was referred “should be empowered to receive information touching such
                    books as tend to atheism, blasphemy, and profaneness, or against the essence and
                    attributes of God, and in particular the book published in the name of one
                    White,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi

                    died 1676) and Hobbes were friends.</p></note> and the book of Mr Hobbes called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Leviathan,</hi> and to report the matter with their
                    opinion to the House.” What steps were taken before the 31st of January
                    following, when the bill was read a third time and passed, does not appear; but
                    Hobbes, then verging upon eighty, was greatly terrified at the prospect of being
                    treated as a heretic, and proceeded to burn such of his papers as he thought
                    might compromise him. At the same time he set himself, with a very
                    characteristic determination, to inquire into the actual state of the law of
                    heresy. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short
                    Dialogues added (in place of the old “Review and Conclusion,” for which the day
                    had passed) as an Appendix to his Latin translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leviathan (L. W.,</hi> iii.), included with the general collection of his works
                    published at Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, as also in the posthumous
                    tract, published in 1680, <hi rend="italic">An Historical Narration concerning
                    Heresy and the Punishment thereof (E. W.,</hi> iv. pp. 385-408), he aimed at
                    showing that, since the High Court of Commission had been put down, there
                    remained in England no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that
                    even when it stood nothing was to be declared heresy but what was at variance
                    with the Nicene Creed, as he maintained the doctrine of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leviathan</hi> was not.</p>
                <p>The only consequence that - came of the parliamentary scare was that Hobbes could
                    never afterwards get permission to print anything on subjects relating to human
                    conduct. The collected edition of his Latin works (in two quarto volumes)
                    appeared at Amsterdam in 1668, because he could not obtain the censor’s licence
                    for its publication at London, Oxford, or Cambridge. Other writings which he had
                    finished, or on which he must have been engaged about this time, were not made
                    public till after his death —the king apparently having made it the price of his
                    protection that no fresh provocation should be offered to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n48/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0048-0039"/> popular sentiment. The most importantof the works
                    composed towards 1670, and thus kept back, is the extremely spirited dialogue to
                    which he gave the title <hi rend="italic">Behemoth: the History of the Causes of
                    the Civil Wars of England and. of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were

                    back at the king’s express desire it saw the light, without Hobbes’s leave, in
                    1679, before his death.</p></note> To the same period probably belongs the
                    unfinished <hi rend="italic">Dialogue between a Philosopher and a Student of the
                    Common La ws of England (E. W.,</hi> vi. pp. 1-160), a trenchant criticism of
                    the constitutional theory of English government as upheld by Coke. Aubrey takes
                    credit for having tried to induce Hobbes to write upon the subject in 1664 by
                    presenting him with a copy of Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Laινs of
                    England,</hi> and though the attempt was then unsuccessful, Hobbes later on took
                    to studying the statute-book, with <hi rend="italic">Coke upon Littleton.</hi>
                    One other posthumous production (besides the tract on Heresy before mentioned)
                    may also be referred to this, if not, as Aubrey suggests, an earlier time—the
                    two thousand and odd elegiac verses into which he amused himself by throwing his
                    view of ecclesiastical encroachment on the civil power; the quaint verses,
                    disposed in his now favourite dialogue-form, were first published, nine years
                    after his death, under the title <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Ecclesiastica</hi><hi rend="italic">(L. W.,</hi> v. pp. 311-408), with a preface
                    by Thomas Rymer.</p>
                <p>For some time Hobbes was not even allowed to utter a word of protest, whatever
                    might be the occasion that his enemies took to triumph over him. In 1669 he had
                    silently to bear the spectacle of an unworthy follower— Daniel Scargil by name,
                    a fellow of Corpus Christi at Cambridge—made to act an edifying part in a public
                    recantation of his principles, after having brought them into discredit by
                    offensively supporting them in the public schools. A few years later, in 1674,
                    he had another experience of academic disfavour when Dr John Fell, the dean of
                    Christ Church, who bore the charges of the Latin translation of Anthony Wood’s
                    <hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford</hi>
                    (1670), struck out all the complimentary epithets in the account of his life,
                    and substituted very different ones; but this time the king did suffer him to
                    defend himself by publishing a dignified letter <hi rend="italic">(Vit.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Auct.,</hi> pp. xlviii. -1.), to which Fell replied by adding to
                    the translation when it appeared a note full of the grossest insults. And, amid
                    all his troubles, Hobbes was not without his consolations. No Englishman of that
                    day stood in the same repute abroad, and foreigners, noble or learned, who came
                    to England, never forgot to pay their respects to the old man, whose vigour and
                    freshness of intellect no progress of the years seemed able to quench.</p>
                <p>His pastimes in the latest years were as singular as his labours. The
                    autobiography in Latin verse, with its playful humour, occasional pathos, and
                    sublime self-complacency, was thrown off at the age of eighty-four. At
                    eighty-five, in the year 1673, he sent forth a translation of four books of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (ix-xii.) in rugged but not seldom happily turned
                    English rhymes; and, when he found this <hi rend="italic">Voyage of Ulysses</hi>
                    eagerly received, he had ready by 1675 a complete translation of both <hi
                    rend="italic">Hiad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odysse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >↑</hi><hi rend="italic">j (E. W.,</hi> x.), prefaced by a lively dissertation
                    “Concerning the virtues of an heroic poem,” showing his unabated interest in
                    questions of literary style. In that year (1675) he ceased coming to London, and
                    thenceforth passed his time at his patron’s seats in Derbyshire, always occupied
                    to the last with some intellectual work in the early morning and in the
                    afternoon hours, which it had long been his habit to devote to thinking and to
                    writing. With such tenacity did he cling to his pursuits (always systematically
                    keeping up exercise for the sake of health) that even as late as August</p>
                <p>1679 he was promising his publisher “somewhat to print in English.” The end came
                    very soon afterwards. A suppression of urine in October, in spite of which he
                    insisted upon being conveyed with the family from Chatsworth to Hardwick Hall
                    towards the end of November, was followed by a paralytic stroke, under which he
                    sank on the 4th of December, in his ninety-second year. He lies buried in the
                    neighbouring parish church of Hault Hucknall.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing sketch the aim has been to give a definite idea of the
                    circumstances in which Hobbes, after slowly developing in the first forty years
                    of his life, displayed a mental activity of such extraordinary variety in his
                    last fifty years. The task of expounding and criticizing either his better-known
                    or his less-known doctrines will not be attempted in this place; but a few
                    remarks may be added as to his position in the general movement of English
                    philosophy. As already suggested, it cannot be allowed that he falls into any
                    regular succession from Bacon; neither can it be said that he handed on the
                    torch to Locke. He was the one English thinker of the first rank in the long
                    period of two generations separating Locke from Bacon, but, save in the
                    chronological sense, there is no true relation of succession among the three. It
                    would be difficult even to prove any ground of affinity among them beyond a
                    disposition to take sense as a prime factor in the account of subjective
                    experience: their common interest in physical science was shared equally by
                    rationalist thinkers of the Cartesian school, and was indeed begotten of the
                    time. Backwards, Hobbes’s relations are rather with Galileo and the other
                    inquirers who, from the beginning of the 17th century, occupied themselves with
                    the physical world in the manner that has come later to be distinguished by the
                    name of science in opposition to philosophy. But it happened that, even more
                    than in external nature, Hobbes was interested in the phenomena of social life,
                    presenting themselves so impressively in an age of political revolution. So it
                    came to pass that, while he was unable, by reason of imperfect training and too
                    tardy development, with all his pains, to make any contribution to physical
                    science or to mathematics as instrumental in physical research, he attempted a
                    task which no other adherent of the new “mechanical philosophy” conceived—
                    nothing less than such a universal construction of human knowledge as would
                    bring Society and Man (at once the matter and maker of Society) within the same
                    principles of scientific explanation as were found applicable to the world of
                    Nature. The construction was, of course, utterly premature, even supposing it
                    were inherently possible; but it is Hobbes’s distinction, in his century, to
                    have conceived it, and he is thereby lifted from among the scientific workers
                    with whom he associated to the .rank of those philosophical thinkers who have
                    sought to order the whole domain of human knowledge. Such as it was, the effects
                    of his philosophical endeavour may be traced on a variety of lines. Upon every
                    subject that came within the sweep of his system, except mathematics and
                    physics, his thoughts have been productive of thought. When the first storm of
                    opposition from smaller men, roused as much by his paradoxical expressions as by
                    his doctrines, had begun to die down, thinkers of real weight, beginning with
                    Cumberland and Cudworth, were moved by his analysis of the moral nature of man
                    to probe anew the question of the natural springs and the rational grounds of
                    human action; and thus it may be said that Hobbes gave the first impulse to the
                    whole of that movement of ethical speculation that, in modem times, has been
                    carried on with such remarkable continuity in England. In politics, the
                    revulsion from his particular conclusions did not prevent the more clearsighted
                    of his opponents from recognizing the force of his supreme demonstration of the
                    practical irresponsibility of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0049-0040"/> the sovereign power, wherever seated, in the
                    state; and, when in a later age the foundations of a positive theory of
                    legislation were laid in England, it was extreme liberals of the school of
                    Bentham—James Mill, Grote, Moles worth— that brought again into general notice
                    the writings of the great publicist of the 17th century, who, however he might,
                    by the force of temperament, himself prefer the rule of one, based his whole
                    political system upon a rational regard to the common weal. Finally, the
                    psychology of Hobbes, though too undeveloped to guide the thoughts or even
                    perhaps arrest the attention of Locke, when essaying the scientific analysis of
                    knowledge, came in course of time (chiefly through James Mill) to be connected
                    with the theory of associationism developed from within the school of Locke, in
                    different ways, by Hartley and Hume; nor is it surprising that the later
                    associationists, finding their principle more distinctly formulated in the
                    earlier thinker, should sometimes have been betrayed into affiliating themselves
                    to Hobbes rather than to Locke.</p>
