                    ancient writer has been at once so familiarly known and so generally appreciated
                    in modern times as Quintus Horatius Flaccus. We seem to know his tastes and
                    habits, and almost to catch the tones of his conversation, from his own works,
                    as we know the character and manner* of Dr Johnson from the pages of Boswell.
                    His twofold function of a satiric moralist and a lyric poet give a peculiar
                    value both to his self-portraiture and to the impressions which he has left of
                    his age. From his <hi rend="italic">Satires,</hi> which deal chiefly with the
                    manners and outward lives of men, we know him in his relations to society and
                    his ordinary moods; from his <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> which deal more
                    with the inner life, we best understand his deepest convictions and the
                    practical side of his philosophy; while his <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> have
                    perpetuated the finest pleasure which he derived from art, nature, and the
                    intercourse of life, have idealized some of the graver as well as the lighter
                    aspects of his reflexion, and given an elevated expression to his sympathy with
                    the national ideas and movement of his time.</p>
                <p>His own writings afford much the fullest and most trustworthy materials for his
                    biography and for the estimate of his character. But a few facts, in addition to
                    those recorded by the poet himself, are known from the short life originally
                    contained in the work of Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">De Vims</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Illustribus.</hi></p>
                <p>Horace was born on the 8th of December 65 B.C., in the consulship of L. Manlius
                    Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta <hi rend="italic">(Ode</hi> iii. 21, 1; <hi
                    rend="italic">Epode</hi> 13, 6). His birthplace was the town of Venusia on the
                    borders of Lucania and Apulia, whence he describes himself as “Lucanus an Apulus
                    anceps” <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi> ii. 1, 34). In his “Journey to Brundusium
                    <hi rend="italic">"(Sat.</hi> i. 5) he marks his recognition of the familiar
                    shapes of the Apulian hills—</p>
                <p>“Incipit ex illo montes Apulia notos Ostentare mihi;” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0171-0160"/> and in one of his finest odes he speaks of Mount
                    Vulturnus as the scene of an adventure of his childhood, which marked him out as
                    a special object of divine protection and as appointed to a poetic destiny. The
                    descriptive touches in that passage, such as “celsae nidum Acherontiae,” show
                    that the-scenery by which he was surrounded in his early years had imprinted
                    itself vividly on his mind. As he connects his native mountains with the dawn of
                    his poetic inspiration, so he associates the name of the “far-sounding Aufidus,”
                    the river familiar to his early recollection, in more than one passage of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> (iii. 30, 10; iv. 9, 2) with his hopes of poetic
                    immortality. He dwells fondly on the virtues of the people belonging to his
                    native district, as in that picture of family happiness and innocence which he
                    paints in the second <hi rend="italic">Epode</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi></p>
                <p>“Quod, si pudica mulier in partem juvet Domum atque dulces liberos, Sabina
                    qualis, aut perusta solibus Pernicis uxor Apuli and elsewhere he recalls with
                    pride the old martial glory of the race amongst whom his first years were passed
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ode</hi> i. 22,14; iii. 5, 9). Like Virgil he regards the
                    Sabellian stock as that branch of the Italian people which had contributed most
                    to the virtue of Rome as well as to her greatness in war. In the Ofella of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> we meet with a still surviving type of that
                    primitive virtue. The Servius Oppidius, whose dying directions to his sons are
                    recorded <hi rend="italic">in Sat.</hi> ii. 3, 168, &amp;c., seems to have been
                    another representative of “the wisdom unborrowed from the schools,” who must
                    have been known to Horace through the tie of neighbourhood. We note also, as a
                    trace of the influence of early impressions on his later tastes, that the name
                    of the “Bandusian fountain,” which he has made as immortal as the names of
                    Castalia or Aganippe, seems to have been transferred by him from a spring in his
                    native district to one on his Sabine farm, which charmed and inspired him in the
                    meridian of his poetical power. We may thus trace some of the germs of his
                    poetical inspiration, as well as of his moral sympathies, to the early years
                    which he spent on the farm near Venusia. But the most important moral influence
                    of his youth was the training and example of his father, of whose worth,
                    affectionate solicitude, and homely wisdom Horace has given a most pleasing and
                    life-like picture <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi> i. 6, 70, &amp;c.). He was a
                    freedman by position; and it is supposed that he had been originally a slave of
                    the town of Venusia, and on his emancipation had received the gentile name of
                    Horatius from the Horatian tribe in which the inhabitants of Venusia were
                    enrolled. After his emancipation he acquired by the occupation of “coactor” (a
                    collector of the payments made at public auctions, or, according to another
                    interpretation, a collector of taxes) sufficient means to enable him to buy a
                    small farm (“macro pauper agello,” <hi rend="italic">Sat.</hi> i. 6, 71), to
                    make sufficient provision for the future of his son <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi>
                    i. 4,108), and to take him to Rome to give him the advantage of the best
                    education there. To his care Horace attributes, not only the intellectual
                    training which enabled him in later life to take his place among the best men of
                    Rome, but also his immunity from the baser forms of moral evil <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sat.</hi> i. 6, 68, &amp;c.). To his practical teaching he attributes also his
                    tendency to moralize and to observe character <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi> i.
                    4,105, &lt;fcc.)—the tendency which enabled him to become the most truthful
                    painter of social life and manners which the ancient world produced. If Horace
                    drew some of his poetical sensibility from the influences of his native
                    district, we may believe that he derived his moral health and practical sagacity
                    from a father who combined with the intelligence and prudence which raised him
                    above his original position the serious spirit and respect for the morality
                    handed down from their forefathers—</p>
                <p>(“mi satis est si Traditum ab antiquis morem servare,” &amp;c.)—</p>
                <p>which formed the basis of the old Italian character.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>C∕. the line of Ennius, which Cicero compares
                    to the voice of a« oracle—</p><p>“Moribus antiquis stat res Romana
                    virisque.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In one of his latest writings <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> ii. 2, 42, &amp;c.)
                    Horace gives a further account of his education; but we hear no more of his
                    father, nor is there any allusion in his writings to the existence of any other
                    member of his family or any other relative. After the ordinary grammatical and
                    literary training at Rome, he went to Athens, the most famous school of
                    philosophy, as Rhodes was of oratory; and he describes himself while there as
                    “searching after truth among the groves of the Academy” as well as advancing in
                    literary accomplishment. His pleasant residence there was interrupted by the
                    breaking out of the civil war. Following the example of his young associates, he
                    attached himself to the cause of Brutus, whom he seems to have accompanied to
                    Asia, probably as a member of his staff; and he served at the battle of Philippi
                    in the post of military tribune. He shared in the rout which followed the
                    battle, and in an ode addressed to his old comrade Pompeius Grosphus he alludes,
                    in imitation of a similar confession of Alcaeus, to the inglorious casting away
                    of his shield. In interpreting sueh passages in the works of Horace, we have
                    always to bear in mind the irony habitual to him, and the reserve imposed on him
                    by his subsequent relations to the chiefs of the victorious party. The
                    enthusiasm which he had felt for the republican cause, though necessarily
                    repressed, still betrays itself in some expressions of that ode, and in that
                    addressed to Asinius Pollio (ii. 1, 21, &amp;c.); and though he describes
                    himself as</p>
                <p>“Imbellis et firmus parum,”</p>
                <p>and as more fitted to treat of the light warfare of love than of the themes of
                    actual war, yet both the martial and the patriotic feeling expressed in many of
                    his later <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> enables us to understand the motives which
                    induced him to quit the placid haunts of art and literature for the harsher
                    experience of the campaign and battlefield.</p>
                <p>He returned to Rome shortly after the battle, stripped of his property, which
                    formed part of the land confiscated for the benefit of the soldiers of
                    Octavianus and Antony. It may have been at this time that he encountered the
                    danger of shipwreck, which he mentions among the perils from which his life had
                    been protected by supernatural aid <hi rend="italic">(Ode</hi> iii. 4, 28). He
                    procured in some way the post of a clerkship in the quaestor’s office, and about
                    three years after the battle of Philippi, he was introduced by Virgil and Varius
                    to Maecenas. This was the turning-point of his fortunes. He owed his friendship
                    with the greatest of literary patrons to his personal merits rather than to his
                    poetic fame; for, though some of his shorter and less important pieces may have
                    been known to a small circle of friends before the date of this introduction,
                    his first published work (book i. of the <hi rend="italic">Satires')</hi> shows
                    that the relations of intimacy and mutual confidence which were never afterwards
                    disturbed had been established between the statesman and poet some time before
                    this book was given to the world. He tells us in one of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires</hi> (i. 10, 31) that his earliest ambition was to write Greek verses.
                    In giving this direction to his ambition, he was probably influenced by his
                    admiration of the old iambic and lyrical poets whom he has made the models of
                    his own <hi rend="italic">Epodes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odes.</hi> A
                    parallel to this may be found in the early Latin verse of Milton and Gray, in
                    whom, as in Horace, the gift of expression has been brought to the highest
                    perfection. His common sense as well as his national feeling fortunately saved
                    him from becoming a second-rate Greek versifier in an age when poetic
                    inspiration had passed from Greece to Italy, and tl·.e <pb break="no"

                    vehicle for the new feelings and interests of men than the echoes of the old
                    Ionian or Aeolian melodies. His earliest Latin compositions were, as he tells
                    us, written under the instigation of poverty; and they alone betray any trace of
                    the bitterness of spirit which the defeat of his hopes and the hardships which
                    he had to encounter on his first return to Rome may have temporarily produced on
                    him. Some of the <hi rend="italic">Epodes,</hi> of the nature of personal and
                    licentious lampoons, and the second <hi rend="italic">Satire</hi> of book i., in
                    which there is some trace of an angry republican feeling, belong to these early
                    compositions. But by the time the first book of <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>
                    was completed and published (35 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) his temper had
                    recovered its natural serenity, and, though he had not yet attained to the
                    height of his fortunes, his personal position was.one of comfort and security,
                    and his intimate relation with the leading men in literature and social rank was
                    firmly established.</p>
                <p>About a year after the publication of this first book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires</hi> Maecenas presented him with a farm among the Sabine hills, in the
                    valley crowned by Mount Lucretilis and watered by the stream Digentia, which
                    joins the main valley of the Anio near the modern Vico Varo (the “Varia”
                    mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Epistles'),</hi> and about 8 miles above the
                    modern Tivoli. No kind of gift could have added more to the poet’s happiness or
                    exercised a more salutary influence on his genius. It made him independent in
                    point of fortune; it satisfied the love of nature which had been implanted in
                    him during the early years spent on the Venusian farm; and it afforded him a
                    welcome escape from the distractions of city life and the dangers of a Roman
                    autumn. The lines <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> i. 16, 15, &amp;c.)—</p>
                <p>“Hae latebrae dulces, etiam, si credis, amoenae, Incolumem tibi me praestant
                    Septembribus horis”— express with simple and sincere feeling the charm of peace
                    and outward beauty as well as the restorative influence which this retreat in
                    the Sabine highlands afforded him. Many passages in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires, Odes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> which recur to the
                    memory of every reader of his poems, express the happiness and pride with which
                    the thought of his own valley filled him, and the interest which he took in the
                    simple and homely ways of his country neighbours. The inspiration of tlιe <hi
                    rend="italic">Satires</hi> came from the heart of Rome; the feeling of many of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> comes direct from the Sabine hills; and even the
                    meditative spirit of the later <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> tells of the
                    leisure and peace of quiet days spent among books, or in the open air, at a
                    distance from “the smoke, wealth, and tumult” of the great metropolis.</p>
                <p>The second book of <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> was published in 29 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Epοdes</hi> apparently about a
                    year earlier, though many of them are, as regards the date of their composition,
                    to be ranked among the earliest extant writings of Horace. Horace speaks of them
                    under the name of “iambi.” In one of his <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> (i. 19,
                    25) he rests his first claim to originality on his having introduced into Latium
                    the metres and spirit of Archilochus—</p>
                <p>“Parios ego primus iambos Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus
                    Archilochi.”</p>
                <p>Yet, whatever technical claim he may have to have naturalized some special
                    combination of metre employed by the poet of Paros, Catullus, Calvus, and
                    Bibaculus had in the preceding generation employed the iambic metre in the
                    spirit of Archilochus more effectively than Horace. His personal lampoons are
                    the least successful of his works; and those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epodes</hi> which treat of other subjects in a poetical spirit are inferior in
                    metrical effect, and in truth and freshness of feeling, both to the lighter
                    lyrics of Catullus and to his own later and more carefully meditated <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Epodes</hi> are chiefly
                    interesting as a record of the personal feelings of Horace during the years
                    which immediately followed his return to Rome, and as a prelude to the higher
                    art and inspiration of the first three books of the <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi>
                    which were published together about the end of 24 or the beginning of 23

                    >Odes</hi> extended over several years, but all the most important among them
                    belong to the years between the battle of Actium and 24 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b,c.,</hi> at which time the poet was between the age of thirty-five and forty,
                    His lyrical poetry is thus, not, like that of Catullus, the ardent utterance of
                    his youth, but the mature and finished workmanship of his manhood. The state of
                    public affairs was more favourable than it had been since the outbreak of the
                    civil war between Caesar and Pompey for the appearance of lyrical poetry. Peace,
                    order, and national unity had been secured by the triumph of Augustus, and the
                    enthusiasm in favour of the new government had not yet been chilled by
                    experience of its repressing influence. The poet’s circumstances were, at the
                    same time, most favourable for the exercise of his lyrical gift during these
                    years. He lived partly at Rome, partly at his Sabine farm, varying his residence
                    occasionally by visits to Tibur, Praeneste, or Baiae. His intimacy with Maecenas
                    was strengthened. He was no longer one among a favoured band of poets, but he
                    had become the familiar friend of the great minister. He was treated with
                    distinction by Augustus, and by the foremost men in Roman society. He complains
                    occasionally that the pleasures of his youth are passing from him, but he does
                    so in the spirit of a temperate Epicurean, who found new enjoyments in life as
                    the zest for the old enjoyments decayed, and who considered the wisdom and
                    meditative spirit,—“the philosophic mind that years had brought,”—an ample
                    compensation for the extinct fires of his youth. The sobering influence of time
                    is acknowledged by him in such lines as</p>
                <p>“Lenit albescens animos capillus or in the still finer expression of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles</hi> (ii. 2, 211), “Lenior et melior fis accedente
                    senecta?”</p>
                <p>About four years after the publication of the three books of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odes,</hi> the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> appeared,
                    introduced, as his <hi rend="italic">Epodes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Satires,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> had been, by a special address to Maecenas. From
                    these <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> as compared with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires,</hi> we gather that he had gradually adopted a more retired and
                    meditative life, and bad become fonder of the country and of study, and that,
                    while owing allegiance to no school or sect of philosophy, he was framing for
                    himself a scheme of life, was endeavouring to conform to it, and was bent on
                    inculcating it on others. He maintained his old friendships, and continued to
                    form new intimacies, especially with younger men engaged in public affairs or
                    animated by literary ambition. After the death of Virgil he was recognized as
                    pre-eminently the greatest living poet, and was accordingly called upon by
                    Augustus to compose the sacred hymn for the celebration of the secular games in
                    17 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> About four years later he published the fourth
                    book of <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> having been called upon to do so by the
                    emperor, in order that the victories of his stepsons Drusus and Tiberius over
                    the Rhaeti and Vindelici might be worthily celebrated. He lived about five years
                    longer, and during these years published the second book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epnstles,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to the Pisos,</hi> more
                    generally known as the <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">PoeticaT</hi> These later <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> are
                    mainly devoted to literary criticism, with the especial object of vindicating
                    the poetic claims of his own age over those of the age of Ennius and the other
                    early poets of Rome. He might havo been expected, as a great critic and lawgiver
                    on literature, to have exercised a beneficial influence on the future poetry <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0173-0162"/> of his country, and to have applied as much
                    wisdom to the theory of his own art as to that of a right life. But his critical
                    <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> are chiefly devoted to a controversial attack υn
                    the older writers and to the exposition of the laws of dramatic poetry, on which
                    his own powers had never been exercised, and for which either the genius or
                    circumstances of the Romans were unsuited. The same subordination of imagination
                    and enthusiasm to good sense and sober judgment characterizes his opinions on
                    poetry as on morals.</p>
                <p>He died somewhat suddenly in the November of the year 8 B,c., within a few weeks
                    of the death of Maecenas, thus strangely confirming the declaration made by him
                    in one of his <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> (ii. 17). Though not an old man, he
                    had reached the full maturity of his faculties, and fully accomplished the work
                    he was fitted to do in the world. He lived longer than any of the illustrious
                    poets immediately contemporary with him or belonging to the preceding
                    generation; and his works show a mature character and a mellow wisdom in
                    striking contrast to the tone of the only other great lyrical poet of Rome, “the
                    young Catullus.”</p>
                <p>Horace is one of the few writers, ancient or modern, who have written a great
                    deal about themselves without laying themselves open to the charge of weakness
                    or egotism. His chief claim to literary originality is not that on which he
                    himself rested his hopes of immortality,—that of being the first to adapt
                    certain lyrical metres to the Latin tongue, —but rather that of being the first
                    of those whose works have reached us who establishes a personal relation with
                    his reader, speaks to him as a familiar friend, gives him good ddvice, tells him
                    the story of his life, and shares with him his private tastes and pleasures,—and
                    all this without any loss of self-respect, any want of modesty or breach of good
                    manners, and in a style so lively and natural that each new generation of
                    readers might fancy that he was addressing them personally and speaking to them
                    on subjects of everyday modern interest. In his self-portraiture, so far from
                    wishing to make himself out better or greater than he was, he seems to write
                    under the influence of an ironical restraint which checks him in the utterance
                    of his highest moral teaching and of his poetical enthusiasm. He affords us some
                    indications of his personal appearance, as where he speaks of the “nigros
                    angusta fronte capillos” of his youth, and describes himself after he had
                    completed his forty-fourth December as of small stature, prematurely grey, and
                    fond of basking in the sun <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> i. 20, 24).</p>
                <p>In his later years his health became weaker or more uncertain, and this caused a
                    considerable change in his habits, tastes, and places of residence. It inclined
                    him more to a life of retirement and simplicity, and also it stimulated his
                    tendency to self-introspection and self-culture. In his more vigorous years,
                    when he lived much in Roman society, he claims to have acted in all his
                    relations to others in accordance with the standard recognized among men of
                    honour in every age, to have been charitably indulgent to the weakness of his
                    friends, and to have been exempt from petty jealousies and the spirit of
                    detraction. If ever he deviates from his ordinary vein of irony and quiet sense
                    into earnest indignation, it is in denouning conduct involving treachery or
                    malice in the relations of friends—as in the lines <hi rend="italic">{Sat.</hi>
                    i. 4, 81, &lt;fcc.)—</p>

                <p>He claims to be and evidently aims at being independent of fortune, superior to
                    luxury, exempt both from the sordid cares of avarice and the coarser forms of
                    profligacy. At the same time he makes a frank confession of indolence and of
                    occasional failure in the pursuit of his ideal self-mastery. He admits his
                    irascibility, his love of pleasure, his sensitiveness to opinion, and some touch
                    of vanity or at least of gratified ambition arising out of the favour which
                    through all his life he had enjoyed from those much above him in social station,
                    “Me primis urbis belli placuisse domique” <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> i. 20,
                    23). Yet there appears no trace of any unworthy deference in Horace’s feelings
                    to the great. Even towards Augustus he maintained his attitude of independence,
                    by declining the office of private secretary which the emperor wished to force
                    upon him; and he did so with such tact as neither to give offence nor to forfeit
                    the regard of his superior. His feeling towards Maecenas is more like that which
                    Pope entertained to Bolingbroke than that which a client in ancient or modern
                    times entertains towards his patron. He felt pride in his protection and in the
                    intellectual sympathy which united him with one whose personal qualities had
                    enabled him to play so prominent and beneficent a part in public affairs. Their
                    friendship was slowly formed, but when once established continued unshaken
                    through their lives. Many passages in the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> show how perfect the confidence was between
                    them, how completely Horace remained his own master, how certainly the bond that
                    united them was one of mutual affection and esteem, not of vanity and
                    interest.</p>
                <p>There is indeed nothing more remarkable in Horace than the independence, or
                    rather the self-dependence, of his character. This saved him from the danger to
                    which his genial qualities exposed him of becoming, like Moore or Burns, the
                    slave of society or the slave of passion. The enjoyment which he drew from his
                    Sabine farm consisted partly in the refreshment to his spirit from the familiar
                    beauty of the place, partly in the “otia liberrima” from the claims of business
                    and society which it afforded him. His love poems, when compared with those of
                    Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius, show that he never, in his mature years at
                    least, allowed his peace of mind to be at the mercy of any one. They are the
                    expressions of a fine and subtle and often a humorous observation rather than of
                    ardent feeling. There is perhaps a touch of pathos in his reference in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi> to the early death of Cinara, but the epithet he applies
                    to her in the <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi></p>
                <p>“Quem seis immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,” shows that the pain of thinking of
                    her could not have been very heart-felt. Even when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odes</hi> addressed to real or imaginary beauties are most genuine in feeling,
                    they are more the artistic rekindling of extinct fires than the utterance of
                    recent passion. In his friendships he had not the self-forgetful devotion which
                    is the most attractive side of the character of Catullus; but he studied how to
                    gain and keep the regard of those whose society he valued, and he repaid this
                    regard by a fine courtesy and by a delicate appreciation of their higher gifts
                    and qualities, whether proved in literature, or war, or affairs of state, or the
                    ordinary dealings of men. He ma’de life more pleasant to himself and others by
                    restraining the propensities which give pain to others, as well as by active
                    good offices and the expression of kindly feelings. He enjoyed the great world,
                    and it treated him well; but he resolutely maintained his personal independence
                    and the equipoise of his feelings and judgment. The mention of Virgil and
                    Maecenas elicits from him warmer expressions of affection and appreciation than
                    that of any of the other famous men of the time; but there is no strain of
                    exaggeration in the language which he applies even to them. If it is thought
                    that in attributing a divine function to Augustus he has gone <pb break="no"

                    admiration, a comparison of the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> in which this occurs
                    with the first <hi rend="italic">Epistle</hi> of the second book shows that he
                    certainly recognized in the emperor a great and successful administrator on whom
                    depended the peace, order, and prosperity of the world, and that the language
                    which at first sight offends our modern sensibilities is to be regarded rather
                    as the artistic expression of the prevailing national sentiment than as the
                    tribute of an insincere adulation.</p>
                <p>The aim of Horace’s philosophy was to “be master of oneself ”—</p>
                <p>“Ille potens sui Laetusque deget,” &amp;c.; to retain the “mens aequa” in all
                    circumstances—</p>
                <p>“Quod ρetis hic est,</p>
                <p>Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit aequus to use the gifts of fortune while
                    they remained, and to be prepared to part with them with equanimity; to make the
                    most of life, and to contemplate its inevitable end without anxiety.
                    Self-reliance and resignation are the lessons which he constantly inculcates.
                    His philosophy is thus a mode of practical Epicureanism combined with other
                    elements which have more affinity with Stoicism. In his early life he professed
                    his adherence to the former system, and several expressions in his first
                    published work show the influences of the study of Lucretius. At the time when
                    the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> was published he professes
                    to assume the position of an eclectic rather than that of an adherent of either
                    school <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> i. 1, 13-19). We note in the passage here
                    referred to, as in other passages, that he mentions Aristippus, the chief of the
                    Cyrenaic school which anticipated the doctrines of Epicurus, rather than
                    Epicurus himself, as the master under whose influence he from time to time
                    insensibly lapsed. Yet the dominant tone of his teaching is that of a refined
                    Epicureanism, not so elevated or purely contemplative as that preached by
                    Lucretius, but yet more within the reach of a society which, though luxurious
                    and pleasure-loving, had not yet become thoroughly frivolous and enervated. His
                    advice is to make the most of the present which alone is within our power—</p>
                <p>“Quod adest memento Componere aequus;”</p>
                <p>to enjoy the pleasures of youth in their season, but to choose some more serious
                    object as life goes on—</p>
                <p>“Nec lusisse pudet, sed non incidere ludum to subdue all violent emotion of fear
                    or desire; to estimate all things calmly—“nil admirari;” to choose the mean
                    between a high and low estate; and to find one’s happiness in plain living
                    rather than in luxurious indulgence. His social and friendly qualities, his
                    enjoyment of refined and simple pleasures, the attitude which he assumed of a
                    critical spectator rather than of an active participator in the various modes of
                    human activity, were all in harmony with the practice and the teaching of
                    Epicurus. Still there was in Horace a robuster fibre, inherited from the old
                    Italian race, which moved him to value the dignity and nobleness of life more
                    highly than its ease and enjoyment. This is perhaps the secret cause of that
                    weariness and dissatisfaction with the comfortable routine of existence which
                    occasionally betrays itself in some of his later writings. But in some of the
                    stronger utterances of his <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> where he expresses
                    sympathy with the manlier qualities of character, whether manifested in the
                    persons of the ancient national heroes or in the civic dress of his own day, we
                    recognize the resistent attitude of Stoicism rather than the passive
                    acquiescence of Epicureanism. The concluding stanzas of the address to Lollius
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ode</hi> iv. 9) exhibit the Epicurean and Stoical view of
                    life so combined as to be more worthy of human dignity than the genial worldly
                    wisdom of the former school, more in harmony with human experience than the
                    formal precepts of the latter :—</p>
                <p>“Non possidentem multa vocaveris Recte beatum; rectius occupat Nomen beati, qui
                    deorum Muneribus sapienter uti Duramque callet pauperiem pati, Pejusque leto
                    fiagitium timet;</p>
                <p>Non ille pro caris amicis</p>
                <p>Aut patria timidus perire.”</p>
                <p>It is interesting to trace the growth of Horace in elevar tion of sentiment and
                    serious conviction from his first ridicule of the paradoxes of Stoicism in the
                    two books of the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> to the appeal which he makes in
                    some of the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of the third book to the strongest Roman
                    instincts of fortitude and self-sacrifice. A similar modification of his
                    religious and political attitude may be noticed between his early declaration of
                    Epicurean unbelief—</p>
                <p>“Namque deos didici securum agere aevum"— and the sympathy which he shows with
                    the religious reaction fostered by Augustus; and again between the Epicurean
                    indifference to national affairs expressed in the words</p>
                <p>“Quid Tiridatem terreat unice Secunis”</p>
                <p>and the strong support which he gives to the national policy of the emperor in
                    the first six <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of the third book, and in the fifth
                    and fifteenth of the fourth book. In his whole religious attitude he seems to
                    stand midway between the consistent denial of Lucretius and Virgil’s pious
                    endeavour to reconcile ancient faith with the conclusions of philosophy. His
                    introduction into some of his <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of the gods of
                    mythology must be regarded as merely artistic or symbolical. Yet in such lines
                    as</p>
                <p>“Di me tuentur, dis pietas mea Et musa cordi est,”</p>
                <p>“Dis te minorem quod geris, imperas,”</p>
                <p>“Immunis aram si tetigit manus,” &amp;c., we recognize the expression of a
                    natural piety, thankful for the blessing bestowed on purity and simplicity of
                    life, and acknowledging a higher and more majestic law, governing nations
                    through their voluntary obedience. On the other hand, his allusions to a future
                    life, as in the “domus exilis Plutonia,'' <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> and the
                    “furvae regna Proserpinae,” are shadowy and artificial. The image of death is
                    constantly obtruded in his poems to enhance the sense of present enjoyment. In
                    the true spirit of paganism he associates all thoughts of love and wine, of the
                    meeting of friends, or of the changes of the seasons with the recollection of
                    the transitoriness of our pleasures—</p>
                <p>“Nos, ubi decidimus</p>
                <p>Quo pius Aeneas, quo dives Tullus et Ancus, Pulvis et umbra sumus.”</p>
                <p>Horaee is so much of a moralist in all his writings that, in order to enter into
                    the spirit both of his familiar and of his lyrical poetry, it is essential that
                    we should realize to ourselves what were his views of life and the influences
                    under which they were formed. He is, though in a different sense from Lucretius,
                    eminently a philosophical and reflective poet. He is also, like all the other
                    poets of the Augustan age, a poet in whose composition culture and criticism
                    were as conspicuous elements as spontaneous inspiration. In the judgment he
                    passes on the older poetry of Rome and on that of his contemporaries, he seems
                    to attach more importance to the critical and artistic than to the creative and
                    inventive functions of genius. It is on the labour and judgment with which he
                    has cultivated his gift—</p>
                <p>“Spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae”— that he rests his hopes of fame. The whole
                    poetry of the Augustan age was based on the works of older poets, Roman.</p>

                <p>as well as Greek. Its aim was to perfect the more immature workmanship of the
                    former, and to adapt the forms, manners, and metres of the latter to subjects of
                    immediate and national interest. As Virgil performed for his generation the same
                    kind of office which Ennius performed for an older generation, so Horace in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Satires,</hi> and to a more limited extent in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> brought to perfection for the amusement and
                    instruction of his contemporaries the rude but vigorous designs of Lucilius.
                    Notwithstanding great differences in their intellectual tastes and culture, and
                    the great differences between a time of republican freedom and one of imperial
                    restraint, in which their respective lots were cast, there was a real affinity
                    of temper and disposition between the first and the second in the line of the
                    great Roman satirists. Horace seems to have made Lucilius to some extent his
                    model, in his manner of life as well as in the form and substance of his satire.
                    We find in the fragments of Lucilius expressions of a love of freedom and
                    independence, of indifference to wealth or public employment, of joy at escaping
                    from the storms of life into a quiet haven, of contentment with his own lot, of
                    the superiority of plain living to luxury, identical in spirit and often similar
                    in manner to those that are almost the common-places of Horace.</p>
                <p>It was the example of Lucilius which induced Horace to commit all his private
                    thoughts, feelings, and experience “to his books as to trusty companions,” and
                    also to comment freely on the characters and lives of other men. Many of the
                    subjects of particular satires of Horace were immediately suggested by those
                    treated by Lucilius. Thus the “Journey to Bruudusium” reproduced the outlines of
                    Lucilius’s “Journey to the Sicilian Straits.” The discourse of Ofella on luxury
                    was founded on a similar discourse of Laelius on gluttony, and the “Banquet of
                    Nasidienus” may have been suggested by the description by the older poet of a
                    rustic entertainment. The same kinds of excess are satirized by both, especially
                    the restless passion of moneymaking and the sordid anxieties of money-saving,
                    and the opposite extreme of profuse and ostentatious expenditure. There was more
                    of moral censure and personal aggressiveness in the satire of the older poet.
                    The ironical temper of Horace induced him to treat the follies of society in the
                    spirit of a. humorist and man of the world, rather than to assail vice with the
                    severity of a censor; and the greater urbanity of his age or of his disposition
                    restrained in him the direct personality of satire. The names introduced by him
                    to mark types of character, such as Nomentanus, Maenius, Pantolabus, &amp;c.,
                    are reproduced from the writings of the older poet. Horace also followed
                    Lucilius in the variety of forms which his satire assumes, and especially in the
                    frequent adoption of the form of dialogue, derived from the “dramatic medley”
                    which was the original character of the Roman <hi rend="italic">Satura.</hi>
                    This form suited the spirit in which Horace regarded the world, and also the
                    dramatic quality of his genius, just as the direct denunciation and elaborate
                    painting of character suited the “saeva indignatio” and the oratorical genius of
                    Juvenal.</p>
                <p>Horace’s satire is accordingly to a great extent a reproduction in form, manner,
                    substance, and tone of the satire of Lucilius; or rather it is a casting in the
                    mould of Lucilius of his own observation and experience. There is little trace
                    of the influence of his Greek studies either in the matter or the manner of this
                    thoroughly Roman work; though he mentions in one passage that, as aids to
                    composition, he had carried with him to the country the works of Archilochus,
                    and of the comic poets Eupolis, Plato, and Menander. But a comparison of the
                    fragments of Lucilius with the finished compositions of Horace brings out in the
                    strongest light the artistic originality and skill of the latter poet in his
                    management of metre and style. Nothing can be rougher and harsher than the
                    hexameters of Lucilius, or cruder than his expression. In his management of the
                    more natural trochaic metre, he has shown much greater ease and simplicity. It
                    is one great triumph of Horace’s genius that he was the first and indeed the
                    only Latin writer who could bend the stately hexameter to the uses of natural
                    and easy, and, at the same time, terse and happy conversational style. Catullus,
                    in his hendecasyllabics, had shown the vivacity with which that light and
                    graceful metre could be employed in telling some short story or describing some
                    trivial situation dramatically. But no one before Horace had succeeded in
                    applying the metre of heroic verse to the uses of common life. But he had one
                    great native model in the mastery of a terse, refined, ironical, and natural
                    conversational style, Terence; and the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> show, not
                    only in allusions to incidents and personages, but in many happy turns of
                    expression very frequent traces of Horace’s familiarity with the works of the
                    Roman Menander.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> are more original in form, more philosophic
                    in spirit, more finished in style than the <hi rend="italic">Satires.</hi> Thé
                    form of composition may have been suggested by that of some of the satires of
                    Lucilius, which were composed as letters to his personal friends. But
                    letter-writing in prose, and occasionally also in verse, had been common among
                    the Romans from the time of the siege of Corinth; and a practice originating in
                    the wants and convenience of friends temporarily separated from one another by
                    the public service was ultimately cultivated as a literary accomplishment. It
                    was a happy idea of Horace to adopt this form for his didactic writings on life
                    and literature. It suited him as an eclectic and not a systematic thinker, and
                    as a friendly counsellor rather than a formal teacher of his age. It suited his
                    circumstances in the latter years of his life, when his tastes inclined him more
                    to retirement and study, while he yet wished to retain his hold on society and
                    to extend his relations with younger men who were rising into eminence. It
                    suited the class who cared for literature,—a limited circle of educated men,
                    intimate with one another, and sharing the same tastes and pursuits. While
                    giving expression to lessons applicable to all men, he in this way seems to
                    address each reader individually, “admissus circum praecordia ludit,” with a
                    subtle power of sympathy and of inspiring sympathy, which respects both himself
                    and his reader. In spirit the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> are more ethical
                    and meditative than the <hi rend="italic">Satires.</hi> Like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi> they exhibit the twofold aspects of his. philosophy,
                    that of temperate Epicureanism and that of more serious and elevated conviction.
                    In the actual maxims which he lays down, in his apparent belief in the efficacy
                    of addressing philosophical texts to the mind, he exemplifies the triteness and
                    limitation of all Roman thought. But the spirit and sentiment of his practical
                    philosophy is quite genuine and original. The individuality of the great Roman
                    moralists, such as Lucretius and Horace, appears not in any difference in the
                    results at which they have arrived, but in the difference of spirit with which
                    they regard the spectacle of human life. In reading Lucretius we are impressed
                    by his earnestness, his pathos, his elevation of feeling; in Horace we are
                    charmed by the serenity of his temper and the flavour of a delicate and subtle
                    wisdom. We note also in the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> the presence of a
                    more philosophic spirit, not only in the expression of his personal convictions
                    and aims, but also in his comments on society. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires</hi> he paints the outward effects of the passions of the age. He shows
                    us prominent types of character—the miser, the parasite, the legacy-hunter, the
                    parvenu, &amp;c., but he does not try to trace these different manifestations of
                    life to their source. In the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> he finds the secret
                    spring of the social vices of the age in the desire, as marked in other times as
                    in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n176/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0176-0165"/> those of Horace, to become rich too fast, and in
                    the tendency to value men according to their wealth, and to sacrifice the ends
                    of life to a superfluous care for the means of living. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires</hi> he dwells on the discontent of men with their actual condition as
                    he noticed the outward manifestation of this spirit in the various callings of
                    life; in his <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> he lays his finger on the real evil
                    from which society was suffering. The cause of all this aimless restlessness and
                    unreasonable desire is summed up in the words “Strenua nos exercet inertia.” In
                    point of style the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> occupy a middle position
                    between the “sermo pedestris” of the <hi rend="italic">Satires,</hi> and the
                    studied grace or the grave majesty of the <hi rend="italic">Odes.</hi> It is the
                    perfection of that kind of style which conceals much thought, insight, and
                    character under a quiet and unpretending exterior. It combines two great
                    excellences of manner both in writing and in conduct, self-restraint with
                    sincerity and simplicity.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> Horace
                    shows himself a genuine moralist, a subtle observer and true painter of life,
                    and an admirable writer. But for both of jthese works he himself disclaims the
                    title of poetry. He rests his claims as a poet on his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odes.</hi> They reveal an entirely different aspect of his genius, his spirit,
                    and his culture. He is one among the few great writers of the world who have
                    attained high excellence in two widely separated provinces of literature. If
                    this division of his powers has been unfavourable to the intensity and
                    spontaneity of his lyrical poetry, it has made him more interesting as a man,
                    and more complete as a representative of his age. Through all his life he was
                    probably conscious of the “ingeni benigna vena,” which in his youth made him the
                    sympathetic student and imitator of the older lyrical poetry of Greece, and
                    directed his latest efforts to poetic criticism. But it was in rhe years that
                    intervened between the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles</hi> that his lyrical genius asserted itself as his
                    predominant faculty. At that time he had outlived the coarser pleasures and
                    risen above the harassing cares of his earlier career; a fresh source of
                    happiness and inspira- • ion had been opened up to him in his beautiful Sabine
                    retreat; he had become not only reconciled to the rule of Augustus, but a
                    thoroughly convinced and, so far as his Temperament admitted of enthusiasm, an
                    enthusiastic believer in its beneficence. But it was only after much labour that
                    his original vein of genius obtained a free and abundant outlet. He lays no
                    claim to the “profuse strains of unpremeditated art,” with which other great
                    lyrical poets of ancient and modern times have charmed the world. He recognizes
                    with modest and truthful self-appreciation the source of his power in the lines
                    in which he contrasts his genius with that of Γindar :—</p>
                <p>“Ego, apis Matinae</p>
                <p>More modoque,</p>
                <p>Grata carpentis thyma per laborem Γlπrimum, circa nemus uvidique Tiburis ripas,
                    operosa parvus Carmina fingo.”</p>
                <p>His first efforts were apparently imitative, and were directed to the attainment
                    of perfect mastery over form, metre, and rhythm. The first nine <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi> of the first book are experiments in different kinds of
                    metre. They and all the other metres employed by him are based on those employed
                    by the older poets of Greece,— Alcaeus, Sappho, Archilochus, Aleman, &amp;c. He
                    has built the structure of his lighter <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> also on their
                    model, while in some of those in which the matter is more weighty, as in that in
                    which he calls on Calliope “to dictate a long continuous strain,” he has
                    endeavoured to reproduce something of the intricate movement, the abrupt
                    transitions, the interpenetration of narrative and reflexion, which charact·rize
                    the art of I ’ indar. He frequently reproduces the language and some of the
                    thoughts of his masters, but he gives to them new application, or stamps them
                    with the impress of his own experience. He brought the metres which he has
                    employed to such perfection that the art perished with him. A great proof of his
                    mastery over rhythm is the skill with which he has varied his metres according
                    to the sentiment which he wishes to express. He has impressed the stamp of his
                    own individuality or of his race upon all of them. Thus his great metre, the
                    Alcaic, has a character of stateliness and majesty in addition to the energy and
                    impetus originally imparted to it by Alcaeus. The Sapphic metre he employs with
                    a peculiar lightness and vivacity which harmonize admirably with his gayer
                    moods. In his combinations of the Asclepiadean we note the grave and thoughtful
                    temperance of tone which pervades those in which the three Asclepiadean line are
                    combined with one Glyconie as in the “Quis desiderio, &lt;fcc.,” “Inclusam
                    Danaen,” &amp;c., the “Divis orte bonis,” &amp;c., and the peculiar simplicity
                    and grace, of a graver character than that of the Sapphic, in those <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes</hi> in which two Asclepiadean lines are combined with one
                    Pherecratean and one Glyconie, as in the</p>
                <p>“Quis mnlta gracilis te puer in rosa,” or the</p>
                <p>“0 tons Bamlusiae, splendidior vitro.”</p>
                <p>Again in regard to his diction, if Horace has learned his subtlety and moderation
                    from his Greek masters, he has tempered those qualities with the masculine
                    characteristics of his race. No writer is more Roman in the stateliness and
                    dignity, the terseness, occasionally even in the sobriety and bare literalness,
                    of his diction. The individuality of the man is equally marked in his vivid and
                    graphic condensation of phrase, whether employed in description of outward
                    scenery or in moral portraiture, in the latent fervour or ironical reserve
                    employed in the indication of personal feeling, and in the generalizing maxims
                    which transmute the experience of some special occasion into a universal
                    experience.</p>
                <p>While it is mainly owing to the extreme care which Horace gave to form, rhythm,
                    and diction that his own prophecy</p>
                <p>“Usque ego postera Crescam laude recens”</p>
                <p>has been so amply fulfilled, yet no greater injustice could be done to him than
                    to rank him either as poet or critic with those who consider form everything in
                    literature. Had he been a writer of that stamp he would probably have attached
                    himself to the school of Alexandrian imitators; and such excellence as he might
                    have obtained would have been appreciated only by limited coteries, whose
                    opinion and tastes do not long influence either the educated or uneducated
                    world. With Horace the mastery over the vehicle of expression was merely an
                    essential preliminary to making a worthy and serious use of that vehicle. He may
                    have erred, in theory at least, rather in the other extreme of exaggerating the
                    didactic office of poetry. If an explanation is to be sought for his disparaging
                    reference to the lyrical art of his predecessor, Catullus, it is not necessary
                    to find that explanation in jealousy, nor in any insensibility to a power of
                    expression of which he has shown the sincerest admiration by attempting to
                    imitate it It is more likely that he was repelled by the purely personal and, as
                    he may have thought, trivial subjects, whether of love or hate, to which the art
                    of his predecessor was almost exclusively limited. The poet, from Horace’s point
                    of view, was intended not merely to give refined pleasure to a few, but, above
                    all things, to be “utilis urbi.” Yet he is saved, in his practice, from the
                    abuse of this theory by his admirable sense, his ironical humour, his
                    intolerance of pretension <pb break="no"

                    he or Catul lus is to be regarded as the greater lyrical poet. Those who assign
                    the palm to Horace will do so, certainly not because they recognize in him
                    richer or equally rich gifts of feeling, conception, and expression, but because
                    the subjects to which his art has been devoted have a fuller, more varied, more
                    mature, and permanent interest for the world.</p>
