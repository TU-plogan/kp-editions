                    similar to that of the abdomen in the honey-ant.</p>
                <p>It is a popular saying that where is the best honey there also is the best wool;
                    and a pastoral district, since it affords a greater profusion of flowers, is
                    superior for the production of honey to one under tillage.<note anchored="true"

                    (A,.V., “butter”) and honey as exclusive articles of diet are indicative of
                    foreign invasion, which turns rich agricultural districts into pasture lands or
                    uncultivated wastes.</p></note> Dry warm weather is that most favourable to the
                    secretion of nectar by flowers. This they protect from rain by various internal
                    structures, such as papillae, cushions of hairs, and spurs, or by virtue of
                    their position (in the raspberry, drooping), or the arrangement of their
                    constituent parts. Dr A. W. Bennett <hi rend="italic">{How Flowers are
                    Fertilized,</hi> p. 31, 1873) has remarked that the perfume of flowers is
                    generally derived from their nectar; the blossoms of some plants, however, as
                    ivy and holly, though almost scentless, are highly nectariferous. The exudation
                    of a honeylike or saccharine fluid, as has frequently been attested, is not a
                    function exclusively of the flowers in all plants. A sweet material, the manna
                    of pharmacy, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> is produced by the leaves and stems of
                    a species of ash, <hi rend="italic">Fraxinus Ornus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and honey-secreting glands are to be met with on the leaves, petioles,
                    phyllodes, stipules (as in <hi rend="italic">Vicia sativa),</hi> or bracteae (as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Marcgraviaceoe)</hi> of a considerable number of
                    different vegetable forms. The origin of the honey-yielding properties
                    manifested specially by flowers among the several parts of plants has been
                    carefully considered by Darwin, who regards the saccharine matter in nectar as a
                    waste product of chemical changes in the sap, which, when it happened to be
                    excreted within the envelopes of flowers, was utilized for the important object
                    of cross-fertilization, and sub sequently was much increased in quantity, and
                    stored in various ways (see <hi rend="italic">Cross and Self Fertilization of
                    Plants,</hi> p, 402 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 1876). It has been noted with
                    respect to the nectar of the fuchsia that it is most abundant when the anthers
                    are about to dehisce, and absent in the unexpanded flower.</p>
                <p>Pettigrew is of opinion that few bees go more than two miles from home in search
                    of honey. The number of blossoms visited in order to meet the requirements of a
                    single hive of bees must be very great; for it has been found by A. S. Wilson
                    (“On the Nectar of Flowers,” <hi rend="italic">Bnt.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> Assoc.</hi><hi rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> 1878, p. 567) that 125 heads
                    of common red clover, which is a plant comparatively abundant in nectar, yield
                    but one gramme (15 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 432 grains) of sugar; and as
                    each head contains about 60 florets, 7,500,000 distinct flower-tubes must on
                    this estimate be exhausted for each kilogramme (2 ’204 lb) of sugar collected.
                    Among the richer sources of honey are reckoned the apple, asparagus, asters,
                    barberry, basswood <hi rend="italic">(TUiα americana),</hi> and the European

                <p>Honey contains dextroglucose and laevoglucose (the former practically insoluble,
                    the latter soluble in ⅜ pt. of cold strong alcohol), cane-sugar (according to
                    some), mucilage, water, wax, essential oil, colouring bodies, a minute quantity
                    of mineral matter, and pollen. By a species of fermentation, the cane-sugar is
                    said to be gradually transformed into inverted sugar (laevoglucose with
                    dextroglucose). The pollen, as a source of nitrogen, is of importance to the
                    bees feeding on the honey. It may be obtained for examination as a sediment from
                    a mixture of honey and water. Other substances which have been discovered in
                    honey are mannite (Guibourt), a free acid which precipitates the salts of silver
                    and of lead, and is soluble in water and alcohol (.Calloux), and an
                    uncrystallizable sugar, nearly related to inverted sugar (Soubeiran, <hi
                    rend="italic">Compt. Rend.,</hi> xxviii. 774-75, 1849). Brittany honey contains
                    <hi rend="italic">couvain,</hi> a ferment which determines its active
                    decomposition (Wurtz, <hi rend="italic">Diet, de Chem.,</hi> ii. 430). In the
                    honey of <hi rend="italic">Polybia apicipenηis,</hi> a wasp of tropical America,
                    cane-sugar occurs in crystals of large size (Karsten, <hi rend="italic">Pogg.
                    Ann.,</hi> C. 550). Dr J. Campbell Brown (“On the Composition of Honey,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Analyst,</hi> iii. 267, 1878) is doubtful as to the presence of
                    cane-sugar in any one of nine samples, from various sources, examined by him.
                    The following average percentage numbers are afforded by his analyses
                    :—laevulose, 36 ’ 45; dextrose, 36 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 57; mineral
                    matter, ’ 15; water expelled at 100° C., 18 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5,
                    and at a much higher temperature, with loss, 7 ’ 81: the wax, pollen, and
                    insoluble matter vary from a trace to 2 1 per cent. The specific gravity of
                    honey is about 1 ’ 41. The rotation of a polarized ray by a solution of 16 ’ 26
                    grammes of crude honey in 100 c.c. of water is generally from — 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2° to — 5° at 60° F.; in the case of Greek honey it
                    is nearly — 5 ’ 5°. Almost all pure honey, when exposed for some time to light
                    and cold, becomes more or less granular in consistency. Any liquid portion can
                    be readily separated by straining through linen. Honey sold out of the comb is
                    commonly clarified by heating and skimming; but according to Bonner it is always
                    best in its natural state. The <hi rend="italic">mel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >depuratum</hi> of British pharmacy is prepared by heating honey in a
                    water-bath, and straining through flannel previously moistened with warm
                    water.</p>
                <p>The term “virgin-honey” (A.-S., <hi rend="italic">huwigtear)</hi> is applied to
                    the honey of young bees which have never swarmed, or to that which flows
                    spontaneously from honeycomb with or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0148-0137"/> without the application of heat. The honey
                    obtained from old hives, considered inferior to it in quality, is ordinarily
                    darker, thicker, and less pleasant in taste and odour. The yield of honey is
                    less in proportion to weight in old than in young or virgin combs. The far-famed
                    honey of Narbonne is white, very granular, and highly aromatic; and still finer
                    honey is that procured from the Corbières mountains, 6 to 9 miles to the
                    south-west. The honey of Gâtinais is usually white, and is less odorous, and
                    granulates less readily than that of Narbonne. Honey from white clover has a
                    greenish-white, and that from heather a rich golden-yellow hue. What is made
                    from honey-dew is dark in colour, and disagreeable to the palate, and does not
                    candy like good honey. “We have seen aphide honey from sycamores,” says F.
                    Cheshire <hi rend="italic">(Pract. Bee-Keeping,</hi> p. 7 4), “as deep in tone
                    as walnut liquor, and where much of it is stored the value of the whole crop is
                    practically <hi rend="italic">nil."</hi> The honey of the stingless bees <hi
                    rend="italic">(Melipoηa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trigona)</hi> of Brazil
                    varies greatly in quality according to the species of flowers from which it is
                    collected, some kinds being black and sour, and others excellent (F. Smith, <hi
                    rend="italic">Trans. Ent. Soc.,</hi> 3d ser., i. pt. vi., 1863). That of <hi
                    rend="italic">Apis Peronii,</hi> of India and Timor, is yellow, and of very
                    agreeable flavour, and is more liquid than the British sorts. <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. unicolor,</hi> a bee indigenous to Madagascar, and naturalized in Mauritius
                    and the island of Réunion, furnishes a thick and syrupy, peculiarly scented
                    green honey, highly esteemed in Western India. A rose-coloured honey is stated
                    <hi rend="italic">(Gard. Chron.,</hi> 1870, p. 1698) to have been procured by
                    artificial feeding. The fine aroma of Maltese honey is due to its collection
                    from orange blossoms, Narbonne honey being harvested chiefly from Labiate
                    plants, as rosemary, an imitation of it is sometimes prepared by flavouring
                    ordinary honey with infusion of rosemary flowers.</p>
                <p>Adulterations of honey are starch, detectable by the microscope, and by its blue
                    reaction with iodine, also wheaten flour, gelatin, chalk, gypsum, pipe-clay,
                    added water, cane-sugar, and common syrup, and the different varieties of
                    manufactured glucose. Honey sophisticated with glucose containing copperas as an
                    impurity is turned of an inky colour by liquids containing tannin, as tea. Elm
                    leaves have been used in America for the flavouring of imitation honey. Stone
                    jars should be employedin preference to common earthenware for the storage of
                    honey, which acts upon the lead glaze of the latter.</p>
                <p>Honey is mildly laxative in properties. Some few kinds are poisonous, as

                    unprepared honey occurring on flowers. According to Hindu medical writers, honey
                    when new is laxative, and when more than a year old astringent (U. C. Dutt, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mat. Med. of the Hindus,</hi> p. 277, 1877). Ceromel, formed by
                    mixing at a gentle heat one part by weight of yellow wax with four of clarified
                    honey, and straining, is used in India and other tropical countries as a mild
                    stimulant for ulcers in the place of animal fats, which there rapidly become
                    rancid and unfit for medicinal purposes. The <hi rend="italic">Koran,</hi> in

                    medicine for men” (Sale’s <hi rend="italic">Koran,</hi> chap, xvi.). Pills
                    prepared with honey as an excipient are said to remain unindurated, however long
                    they may be kept <hi rend="italic">(Med. Times,</hi> 1857, i. 269). Mead, of
                    yore a favourite beverage in England (vol. iv. p. 264), is made by fermentation
                    of the liquor obtained by boiling in water combs from which the honey has been
                    drained. In the preparation of sack-mead, an ounce of hops is added to each
                    gallon of the liquor, and after the fermentation a small quantity of brandy.
                    Metheglin, or hydromel, is manufactured by fermenting with yeast a solution of
                    honey flavoured with boiled hops (see Cooley, <hi rend="italic">Cyclop.').</hi>
                    A kind of mead is largely consumed in Abyssinia (vol. i. p. 64), where it is
                    carried on journeys in large horns (Stern, <hi rend="italic">Wanderings,</hi> p.

                    of honey for the production of alcohol; he recommends it, however, as superior
                    to sugar for the thickening of liqueurs, and also as a means of sweetening
                    imperfectly ripened vintages. It is occasionally employed for giving strength
                    and flavour to ale. In ancient Egypt it was valued as an embalming material; and
                    in the East, for the preservation of fruit, and the making of cakes, sweatmeats,
                    and other articles of food, it is largely consumed. Grafts, seeds, and birds’
                    eggs, for transmission to great distances, are sometimes packed in honey. In
                    India a mixture of honey and milk, or of equal parts of curds, honey, and
                    clarified butter (Sansk., <hi rend="italic">madhu-parka),</hi> is a respectful

                    mouth of a new-born male infant. Honey is frequently alluded to by the writers

                    the Jewish ritual (Lev. ii. 11). With milk or water it was presented by the

                    and probably in some passages (as Gen. xliii. 11 and Ez. xxvii. 17) the syrupy
                    boiled juice of the grape, resembling thin molasses, in use in Palestine,
                    especially at Hebron, under the name of. <hi rend="italic">dibs</hi> (see Kitto,

                    highly of a honey produced at Jericho, consisting of the expressed juice of the
                    fruit of palm trees; and Herodotus (iv. 194) mentions a similar preparation made
                    by the Gyzantians in North Africa, where it is still in use. The honey most
                    esteemed by the ancients was that of Mount Hybla in Sicily, and of Mount
                    Hymettus in Attica (vol. iii. p. 59). Mahaffy <hi rend="italic">{Rambles in
                    Greece,</hi> p. 148, 2d ed., 1878) describes the honey of Hymettus as by no
                    means so good as the produce of other parts of Greece—not to say of the heather
                    hills of Scotland and Ireland. That of Thebes, and more especially that of
                    Corinth, which is made in the thymy hills towards Cleonae, he found much better
                    (c∕. vol. xi. p. 88). Honey and wax, still largely obtained in Corsica (vol. vi.
                    p. 440), were in olden times the chief productions of the island. In England, in
                    the 13th and 14th centuries, honey sold at from about 7d. to Is. 2d. a gallon,
                    and occasionally was disposed of by the swarm or hive, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ruscha</hi> (Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Agric. and Prices in Eng.,</hi>
                    i. 418). At Wrexham, Denbigh, Wales, two honey fairs are annually held, the one
                    on the Thursday next after the 1st September, and the other, the more recently
                    instituted and by far the larger, on the Thursday following the first Wednesday
                    in October. In Hungary the amounts of honey and of wax are in favourable years
                    respectively about 190,000 and 12,000 cwt., and in unfavourable years, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 1874, about 12,000 and 3000 cwt. The hives there in
                    1870 numbered 617,407 (or 40 per 1000 of the population, against 45 in Austria).
                    Of these 365,711 were in Hungary Proper, and 91,348 (87 per 1000 persons) in the
                    Military Frontier (Keleti, <hi rend="italic">Uebersicht</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    system of bee-keeping introduced by Dolinowski has been found to afford an
                    average of 40 tt&gt; of honey and wax and two new swarms per hive, the common
                    peasant’s hive yielding, with two swarms, only 3 lb of honey and wax. In forests
                    and places remote from villages in Podolia and parts of Volhynia, as many as
                    1000 hives may be seen in one apiary. In the district of Ostrolenka, in the
                    government of Plock, and in the woody region of Polesia, in Lithuania, a method
                    is practised of rearin" bees in excavated trunks of trees (Stanton, “On the
                    Treatment of Bees in Poland,” <hi rend="italic">Technologist,</hi> vi. 45,
                    1866). When, in August, in the loftier valleys of Bormio, Italy, flowering
                    ceases, the bee ι in their wooden hives are by means of spring-carts transported
                    at night to lower regions, where they obtain from the buckλvheat crops the
                    inferior honey which serves them for winter consumption <hi rend="italic"

                    27), wild bees are very numerous, especially in the wilderness of Judaea, and
                    the selling of their produce, obtained from crevices in rocks, hollows in trees,
                    and elsewhere, is with many of the inhabitants a means of subsistence.
                    Commenting on 1 Sam. xiv. 26, J. Roberts <hi rend="italic">(Oriental
                    Illust.</hi>)remarks that in the East “the forests literally flow with honey;
                    large combs may be seen hanging on the trees, as you pass along, full of honey.”
                    In Galilee, and at Bethlehem and other places in Palestine, bee-keeping is
                    extensively carried on. The hives are sun-burnt tubes of mud, about 4 feet in
                    length and 8 inches in diameter, and, with the exception of a small central
                    aperture for the passage of the bees, closed at each end with mud. These are
                    laid together in long rows, or piled pyramidally, and are protected from the sun
                    by a covering of mud and of boughs. The honey is extracted, when the ends have
                    been removed, by means of an iron hook. (See Tristram, <hi rend="italic">Nat.
                    Hist, of the Bible,</hi> pp. 322 <hi rend="italic">sg.,</hi> 2d ed., 1868).
                    Apiculture in Turkey is in a very rude condition. The Bali-dagh, or “Honey
                    Mount,” in the plain of Troy, is so called on account of the numerous wild bees
                    tenanting the caves in its precipitous rocks to the south. In various regions of
                    Africa, as on the west, near the Gambia, bees abound. Cameron was informed by
                    his guides that the large quantities of honey at the cliffs by the river
                    Makanyazi were under the protection of an evil spirit, and not one of his men
                    could be persuaded to gather any <hi rend="italic">(Across Africa,</hi> i. 266).
                    On the precipitous slopes of the Teesta valley, in India, the procuring of honey
                    from the pendulous bees ’- nests, which are sometimes large enough to be
                    conspicuous features at a mile’s distance, is the only means by which the idle
                    poor raise their annual rent (Hooker, <hi rend="italic">Him. Joum.,</hi> it
                    41).</p>

                    young bees are esteemed delicacies, ascend the trunks of lofty forest trees by
                    the •use of a loop of creeper. Protected from the myriads of angry insects by a
                    small torch only, they detach the combs from the under surface of the branches,
                    and lower them by slender cords to the ground (Wallace, <hi rend="italic">Joum.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honey-Farming in America.</hi> —So rapid of late years has
                    been the development of bee-keeping in the United States, that the taking of
                    steps to secure the fullest and most accurate details with respect to that
                    industry has been deemed necessary by the commissioners of agriculture. It has
                    been estimated by several intelligent bee-keepers that there are in the United
                    States 700,000 hives of bees, owned by 35,000 people, of whom at least 30,000
                    are farmers possessing on an average not more than 3 hives each, the remaining
                    5000 being professional apiarians. Mr G. Μ. Doolittle, of Borodino, N.Y., on the
                    Auburn branch of the New York Central Railway, obtained in 1877 an average of
                    100 lb of honey apiece from his hives, and from one of them the exceptionally
                    large yield of 700 lb. It is not unreasonable to say that the hives in the
                    United States afford each a net supply of about 50 lb of surplus honey, which,
                    selling at 20 cents (lOd.) per lb, returns a good profit to the owners. All
                    American honey is classed by the api-culturist according to the plants from
                    which it is derived. It is only in rare cases that pasturage is specially
                    cultivated for the bees. In the States east of the Rocky Mountains there are
                    three chief sources of honey. Those which yield the most delicately flavoured
                    and whitest and therefore most valuable commodity (see above) are, first, the
                    immense forests of basswood, the honey from which has perhaps a slight minty
                    flavour, and, secondly, white clover grass, cultivated throughout the States for
                    hay and stock pasture, which furnishes a honey pronounced by competent judges
                    superior to that of the world-renowned Hymettus. Bees having access to both
                    basswood and white clover frequently store the honey from each in the same
                    cells. The third and often richest source of supply is buckwheat, which blossoms
                    after the basswood and white clover have ceased to yield. The pungent honey
                    obtained therefrom, though by its dark colour rendered unsuitable for the table,
                    is greatly valued for manufacturing purposes, more especially in the brewing of
                    fine beer, since it forms a perfectly clear solution, ferments well, and is
                    richer in saccharine matter than the glucose commonly employed by brewers, which
                    moreover is apt to be con- · taminated with the acids employed in its
                    preparation. Buckwheat honey is also accounted a good remedy in bronchial
                    affections, and is therefore in request for the making of cough mixtures. The
                    day is probably not far distant when the refining of the large quantities of
                    dark honey which are harvested will be undertaken on an extensive scale.</p>
                <p>For the successful prosecution of bee-keeping energy and perseverance, as well as
                    experience and considerable capital, are requisite. There are not more than four
                    bee-keepers in the United States who own so many as 2500 or 3000 hives. The
                    largest apiaries are the property of Mr J. S. Harbison of California. They are
                    six in number, and situated within easy patrol distance from one another <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0150-0139"/> in the extreme south-west corner of the United
                    States, in a narrow strip of country known as the “bee-belt” of California,
                    which enjoys the soft and equable climate of the'Pacific coast. Timber iu this
                    region is confined to the bottoms near running streams, and to the cahons, the
                    valleys and hill-sides being covered with stunted brushwood and an abundant
                    growth of white sage,—an herb similar to the garden sage, and not to be
                    confounded with the sagebrush of Nevada and Utah, which is a species of
                    wormwood,— sumach, and other flowering plants. These bloom nine months in the
                    year, but are most luxuriant in May and June. The white sage affords a honey
                    comparable to that obtained from the basswood of the eastern States. The
                    Californian honey, owing to the innocuous nature of the flowers from which it is
                    procured, is devoid of the colic-producing properties ascribed to some other
                    varieties of honey. Mr Harbison employs fifteen men in his apiaries, and is
                    reaping rich profits from very many thousands of acres useless for ordinary
                    purposes. Active operations begin in February, and in March or April the bees
                    swarm. The taking of the honey commences usually about May 20th. From the early
                    part of August till as late as October the flowers provide no more honey than is
                    just sufficient for the subsistence of the bees. When October has begun, though
                    the air is still mild, the bees cease to work, becoming semi-dormant, except for
                    an hour or two every eight or ten days, when they fly near their hives in the
                    sunshine. The fact that honey until the middle of the 16th century was the only
                    sweet in general use, and that the aggregate annual consumption of sugar is now
                    from 2 to 2⅛ millions of tons, points to the conclusion that apiculture, if
                    skilfully and extensively conducted, might ere long become productive of results
                    of very high importance to commerce. For further information regarding American
