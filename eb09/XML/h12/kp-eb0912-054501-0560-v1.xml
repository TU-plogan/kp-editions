                        >φoβiω,</hi> to fear (Syn. <hi rend="italic">Rabies, Lyssa),</hi> an acute
                    infectious disease, occurring chiefly in certain of the lower animals,
                    particularly the canine species, and liable to be communicated by them to other
                    animals, and to man. The main features of the disease are similar alike in the
                    lower animals and men, but that peculiar symptom from which the malady derives
                    its name, viz., the dread of water, appears only to affect the latter. Rabies as
                    it manifests itself in animals belongs to the subject of veterinary medicine;
                    the present notice refers only to hydrophobia occurring in man. The disease has
                    been known from early times, and is alluded to in the works of Aristotle,
                    Xenophon, Plutarch, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and many others, as well as in those
                    of the early writers on medicine. Celsus gives detailed instructions respecting
                    the treatment of men who have been bitten by rabid dogs, and dwells on the
                    dangers attending such wounds. After recommending suction of the bitten part by
                    means of a dry cupping glass, and thereafter the application of the actual
                    cautery or of strong caustics, and the employment of baths and various internal
                    remedies, he says: “Idque cum ita per triduum factum est, tutus esse homo a
                    periculo videtur. Solet autem ex eo vulnere, ubi parum occursum est, aquae timor
                    nasci, <hi rend="italic">υδροφοβίαν</hi> Graeci appellant. Miserrimum genus
                    morbi; in quo simul aeger et siti et aquae metu cruciatur; quo oppressis in
                    angusto spes est.” Subsequently Galen described minutely the phenomena of
                    hydrophobia, and recommended the excision of the wounded part as a protection
                    against the disease. Throughout many succeeding centuries little or nothing was
                    added to the facts which the early physicians had made known upon the subject.
                    The malady was regarded with universal horror and dread, and the unfortunate
                    sufferers were generally abandoned by all around them and left to their terrible
                    fate. In later times the investigations of Boerhaave, Van Swieten, John Hunter,
                    Magendie⅛ Breschet, Virchow, Reder, as also of Youatt, Fleming, Meynell,
                    Hertwig, and others, have furnished important information; nevertheless much
                    remains obscure as to the nature and pathology of this formidable disease.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be said as to the spontaneous development of rabies in animals—a
                    view which is now generally discredited—there can be no doubt that in man the
                    disease is in every instance the result of the inoculation of the viru&gt; <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0561-0546"/> contained in the secretions of the mouth of
                    the affected animal into a wound or abrasion of the skin or mucous membrane. In
                    the great majority of cases (90 per cent.) this is due to the bite of a rabid
                    dog, but bites of rabid cats, wolves, foxes, jackals, &amp;c., are occasionally
                    the means of conveying the disease. There is no evidence that the poison can be
                    introduced into the system without an abrasion of the surface. But it must be
                    observed that even of those who have undoubtedly been bitten by rabid animals,
                    only a proportion subsequently suffer from hydrophobia. Thus where the bite has
                    been inflicted on a part of the body protected by clothing, the virus may be
                    wiped from the teeth of the animal before they penetrate the skin. Hence it is
                    found that bites on exposed parts such as the face are very much more dangerous
                    than on other parts which are ordinarily covered. But further, individual
                    susceptibility must be taken into account, for it is undeniable that many
                    persons in whom the virus of rabies has been inoculated escape hydrophobia. John
                    Hunter mentions one remarkable instance in which of twenty-one persons bitten by
                    a rabid dog only one subsequently died from hydrophobia; and a comparison of the
                    best authorities would seem to show that the proportion of those who are
                    attacked with the disease to those who are bitten is less than one-half,
                    Numerous popular fallacies prevail on the subject of hydrophobia. Thus it is
                    supposed that the bite of an angry dog may produce the disease, and all the more
                    if the animal should subsequently develop symptoms of rabies. The ground for
                    this erroneous notion is the fact, which is unquestionable, that animals in whom
                    rabies is in the stage of incubation, during which there are few if any
                    symptoms, may by their bites convey the disease, though fortunately during this
                    early stage they are little disposed to bite. The bite of a non-rabid animal,
                    however enraged, cannot give rise to hydrophobia. Another fallacious notion, not
                    altogether of popular origin, but maintained by a few eminent professional
                    authorities, is to the effect that there is no such disease as hydrophobia at
                    all, but that the symptoms designated by that name are entirely mental phenomena
                    produced by the effect of fear of the consequences following a bite. It might be
                    sufficient as a reply to this to point to the uniform sequence of terrible
                    symptoms which mark the progress of the malady when it has commenced, and to its
                    acute course and invariably fatal termination; but there is the additional fact
                    that very young children, in whom this feeling could scarcely be expected to
                    operate, may suffer and die from hydrophobia.</p>
                <p>The period of incubation of the disease, or that time which elapses between the
                    introduction of the virus and the development of the symptoms, appears to vary
                    in a remarkable degree, being in some cases as short as a fortnight, and in
                    others as long as several months or even years. On an average it seems to be
                    from about six weeks to three months. The rare instances of the appearance of
                    hydrophobia many years after the introduction of the poison are always more or
                    less open to question as to subsequent inoculation. During the period of
                    latency, in which the patient seems perfectly well, it is supposed that the
                    poison is undergoing a sort of multiplication, both in the previously wounded
                    part and in the system at large, somewhat analogous to the fermentive process,
                    and that ultimately it comes to tell with deadly effect upon certain portions of
                    the nervous system.</p>
                <p>When the disease is about to declare itself it not unfrequently happens that the
                    wound, which had quickly and entirely healed after the bite, begins to exhibit
                    evidence of irritation or inflammatory action, or at least to be the seat of
                    morbid sensations such as numbness, tingling, or itching. The symptoms
                    characterizing the premonitory stage are great mental depression and
                    disquietude, together with restlessness and a kind of indefinite fear. There is
                    an unusual tendency to talk, and the articulation is abrupt and rapid. Although
                    in some instances the patients will not acknowledge that they have been
                    previously bitten, and deny it with great obstinacy, yet generally they are well
                    aware of the nature of their malady, and speak despairingly of its consequences.
                    There is in this early stage a certain amount of constitutional disturbance
                    showing itself by feverishness, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, headache, great
                    nervous excitability, respiration of a peculiar sighing or sobbing character,
                    and even occasionally a noticeable aversion to liquids. These
                    symptoms—constituting what is termed the melancholic stage—continue in general
                    for one or two days, when they are succeeded by the stage of excitement in which
                    all the characteristic phenomena of the malady are fully developed. Sometimes
                    the disease first shows itself in this stage, without antecedent symptoms.</p>
                <p>The agitation of the sufferer now becomes greatly increased, and the countenance
                    exhibits anxiety and terror. There is noticed a marked embarrassment of the
                    breathing, but the most striking and terrible features of this stage are the
                    effects produced by attempts to swallow fluids. The patient suffers from thirst
                    and desires eagerly to drink, but on making the effort is seized with a most
                    violent suffocative paroxysm produced by spasm of the muscles of swallowing and
                    breathing, which continues for several seconds, and is succeeded by a feeling of
                    intense alarm and distress. With great caution and determination the attempt is
                    renewed, but only to be followed with a repetition of the seizure, until the
                    unhappy sufferer ceases from sheer dread to try to quench the thirst which
                    torments him. Indeed the very thought of doing so suffices to bring on a choking
                    paroxysm, as does also the sound of the running of water. The patient is
                    extremely sensitive to any kind of external impression; a bright light, a loud
                    noise, a breath of cool air, contact with any one, are all apt to bring on one
                    of these seizures. But besides these suffocative attacks there also occur
                    general convulsions affecting the whole muscular system of the body, and
                    occasionally a condition of tetanic spasm. These various paroxysms increase in
                    frequency and severity with the advance of the disease, but alternate with
                    intervals of comparative quiet, in which, however, there is intense anxiety and
                    more or less constant difficulty of breathing, accompanied with a peculiar
                    sonorous expiration, which has suggested the notion that the patient barks like
                    a dog. In many instances there is great mental disturbance, with fits of
                    maniacal excitement, in which he strikes at every one about him, and accuses
                    them of being the cause of his sufferings,—these attacks being succeeded by calm
                    intervals in which he expresses great regret for his violent behaviour. During
                    all this stage of the disease the patient is tormented with a viscid secretion
                    accumulating in his mouth, which from dread of swallowing he is constantly
                    spitting about him. There may also be noticed snapping movements of the jaws as
                    if he were attempting to bite, but these are in reality a manifestation of the
                    spasmodic action which affects the muscles generally. There is no great amount
                    of fever, but there is constipation, diminished flow of urine, and often sexual
                    excitement.</p>
                <p>After two or three days of suffering of the most terrible description the patient
                    succumbs, death taking place-either in a paroxysm of choking, or on the other
                    hand in a tranquil manner from exhaustion, all the symptoms having abated, and
                    the power of swallowing returned before the end. The duration of the disease
                    from the first declaration of the symptoms is generally from three to five
                    days.</p>
                <p>Post-mortem examination has not hitherto thrown much light upon this malady, but
                    the subject is at the present time engaging the special attention of certain
                    eminent pathologists, and important and valuable information may <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n562/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0562-0547"/> be anticipated. The chief morbid changes
                    which have been described are evidences of congestion and inflammatory action in
                    certain portions of the brain and spinal cord, but more particularly in the
                    locality known as the “respiratory centre” of the medulla oblongata, where the
                    accumulation of “leucocytes” around the small blood-vessels and in the
                    surrounding nervous substanceare a prominent phenomenon. Similar changes have
                    been found in the salivary glands. On the whole, however, it can scarcely be
                    said that the formidable array of symptoms above narrated are accounted for by
                    these appearances, which in the opinion of some are in all likelihood merely the
                    results of antecedent processes of an occult nature affecting the nerve centres
                    and forming the essence of the disease.</p>
                <p>That emotional disturbance is present is undeniable, for it is found that those
                    cases of hydrophobia are less severe where there is no suspicion on the part of
                    the sufferer of the nature of his complaint; yet this only represents one of
                    many elements. The function of the eighth pair of nerves (which are largely
                    concerned in the processes of respiration and deglutition) is disturbed in a
                    marked degree, and it is probable that this is the portion of the nervous system
                    upon which the poison most powerfully exerts its specific action. But that the
                    great nerve centres, viz., the brain and spinal cord as a whole, are profoundly
                    affected, is manifest in the tendency to general convulsion, the remarkable
                    hyperaesthesia, and the mental perturbation of the patient.</p>
                <p>The treatment of most avail in this disease is that which is directed towards
                    preventing the absorption of the poison into the system. This may be
                    accomplished by excision of the part involved in the bite of the rabid animal,
                    or, where this from its locality is impracticable, in the application to the
                    wound of some chemical agent which will destroy the activity of the virus, such
                    as potassa fusa, lunar caustic (nitrate of silver), or the actual cautery in the
                    form of a red-hot wire. The part should be thoroughly acted on by these agents,
                    no matter what amount of temporary suffering this may occasion. Such
                    applications should be resorted to immediately after the bite has been
                    inflicted, or as soon thereafter as possible. Further, even though many hours or
                    days should elapse, these local remedies should still be applied; for if, as
                    appears probable, some at least of the virus remains for long at the injured
                    part, the removal or effectual destruction of this may prevent the dread
                    consequences of its absorption. Every effort should be made to tranquillize and
                    reassure the patient.</p>
                <p>When once the symptoms of hydrophobia have declared themselves, little can be
                    achieved by the resources of the physician beyond palliating the agonizing
                    sufferings and rendering easier the inevitably fatal event.</p>
                <p>Medicines cannot be administered by the mouth, owing to the impossibility of
                    swallowing and the distress occasioned by the effort to do so; they must
                    therefore be given either by the bowel in the form of enema, by hypodermic
                    injection, or by inhalation. The most approved and potent agents are opium,
                    belladonna, curara, chloral, and chloroform inhalation. The vapour bath is also
                    recommended. It need scarcely be said that those coming in contact with the
                    patient should guard against the risk of being bitten during the paroxysms of
                    excitement, or of being inoculated by the saliva, for although there are few if
                    any well-authenticated cases of the disease being communicated in this way, yet
                    the possibility must be admitted.</p>
                <p>It should be remarked that occasionally an individual who may have at some time
                    been bitten by a non-rabid dog manifests symptoms strongly resembling in many
                    points those of hydrophobia. These are often simply the effect of fear, and have
                    much of the hysterical element mixed up with them. They are generally of much
                    less severity in every way than those of the true disease, and yield readily to
                    treatment appropriate to the disturbed nervous condition. <hi rend="smallcaps"
