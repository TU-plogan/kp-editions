                    mother was the daughter of a merchant of that city. Having embraced the loyalist
                    side, Leigh Hunt’s father was compelled to fly to England, where he took orders,
                    and acquired some reputation as a popular preacher, but want of steadiness, want
                    of orthodoxy, and want of interest conspired to prevent his obtaining any
                    preferment. Leigh Hunt was educated at Christ’s Hospital, of which school as it
                    existed in his time he has left a lively account in his autobiography. An
                    impediment in his speech, afterwards removed, prevented his being sent to the
                    university. “For some time after I left school,” he says, “I did nothing but
                    visit my school-fellows, haunt the book stalls, and write verses.” These latter
                    were published in 1802 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Juvenilia,</hi> and,
                    although the mere literary exercises of a clever boy, contributed to introduce
                    him into literary and theatrical society. He began to write for the newspapers,
                    published a volume of theatrical criticisms in 1807, and in 1808 quitted the War
                    Office, where he had for some time filled a situation as clerk, to assume the
                    editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> newspaper, a speculation of
                    his brother John. The new journal soon acquired a high reputation for
                    independence, both in political and literary criticism. It was perhaps the only
                    newspaper of the time which owed no allegiance to any political party, but
                    assailed whatever seemed amiss, “from a principle of taste,” as Keats happily
                    expressed it. The taste of the attack itself, indeed, was not always
                    unexceptionable; and one upon the prince regent, unseemly and imprudent without
                    doubt, but the chief sting of which lay in its substantial truth, occasioned
                    (1813) a prosecution and a sentence of two years’ imprisonment in the Surrey
                    jail. The effect was naturally to make Hunt a hero for the time being, and to
                    give a political <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0396-0383"/> direction to the career of a man of letters. The
                    position was an essentially false one, and led to an entire misunderstanding of
                    Leigh Hunt’s character and aptitudes alike on the part of his friends and his
                    antagonists. For the time he was exceedingly popular; the cheerfulness and
                    gaiety with which he bore his imprisonment, and his amusing devices to mitigate
                    its severity, attracted general attention and sympathy, and brought him visits
                    from Byron, Moore, Brougham, and others, whose acquaintance exerted much
                    influence on his future destiny. In 1816 he made a permanent mark in English
                    literature by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Story of Rimini.</hi>
                    There is perhaps no other instance of a poem short of the highest excellence
                    having produced so important and durable an effect in modifying the accepted
                    standards of literary composition. The secret of Hunt’s success consists less in
                    superiority of genius than of taste. His refined critical perception had
                    detected the superiority of Chaucer’s versification, as adapted to the present
                    state of our language by Dryden, over the sententious epigrammatic couplet of
                    Pope which had superseded it. By a simple return to the old manner he effected
                    for English poetry in the comparatively restricted domain of metrical art what
                    Wordsworth had already effected in the domain of nature; his is an achievement
                    of the same class, though not of the same calibre. His poem is also a triumph in
                    the art of poetical narrative, abounds with verbal felicities, and is pervaded
                    throughout by a free, cheerful, and animated spirit, notwithstanding the tragic
                    nature of the subject. It has been remarked that it does not contain one
                    hackneyed or conventional rhyme. Other characteristic traits are less
                    commendable, and the writer’s occasional flippancy and familiarity, not seldom
                    degenerating into the ludicrous, made him a mark for ridicule and parody on the
                    part of his opponents, whose animosity, however, was rather political than
                    literary. These faults were still more conspicuous in other pieces published by
                    him about this date. Ere long, however, Keats’s “Lamia” and Shelley’s “Julian
                    and Maddalo” manifested the deliverance which he had wrought for English
                    narrative poetry. Both these illustrious men belonged to the. circle gathered
                    around him at Hampstead, which also included Hazlitt, Lamb, Procter, Haydon,
                    Cowden Clarke, Dilke, Coulson, Reynolds, and in general almost all the rising
                    young men of letters of Liberal sympathies. He had now for some years been
                    married to Marianne Kent, who seems to have been sincerely attached to him, but
                    was not in every respect a desirable partner. His own affairs were by this time
                    in the utmost confusion, and he was only saved from ruin by the romantic
                    generosity of Shelley. In return he was lavish of sympathy to Shelley at the
                    time of the latter’s domestic distresses, and defended him with spirit in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> although he does not appear to have at this
                    date appreciated his genius with either the discernment or the warmth of his
                    generous adversary, Professor Wilson. Keats he welcomed with enthusiasm, and
                    aided to the uttermost, though Keats seems to have subsequently felt that Hunt’s
                    example as a poet had been in some respects detrimental to him. After Shelley’s
                    departure for Italy (1818) Leigh Hunt’s affairs became still more embarrassed,
                    and the prospects of political reform less and less satisfactory. His health and
                    his wife’s failed, and he was obliged to discontinue his charming series of
                    essays entitled the <hi rend="italic">Indicator,</hi> having, he says, “almost
                    died over the last numbers.” These circumstances induced him to listen to a
                    proposal, which seems to have originated with Shelley, that he should proceed to
                    Italy and join Shelley and Byron in the establishment of a periodical work in
                    which Liberal opinions should be advocated with more freedom than was possible
                    at home. The project was injudicious from every point of view; it would have
                    done little for Hunt or the Liberal cause at the best, and depended entirely
                    upon the co-operation of Byron, the most capricious of allies, and the most
                    parsimonious of paymasters. Byron’s principal motive for acceding to it appears
                    to have been the expectation of acquiring influence over the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Examiner,</hi> and he was exceedingly mortified on discovering when too late
                    that Hunt had parted, or was considered to have parted, with his interest in the
                    journal. Leigh Hunt left England for Italy in November 1821, but storm,
                    sickness, and misadventure retarded his arrival until June 1822, a rate of
                    progress which Peacock appropriately compares to the navigation of Ulysses.</p>
                <p>Hunt’s arrival in Italy was almost immediately followed by the tragic death of
                    Shelley, which destroyed every prospect of success for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liberal.</hi> Hunt was now virtually a dependant upon Byron, whose least
                    amiable qualities were called forth by the relation of patron to an
                    unsympathetic dependant, burdened with a large and troublesome family, and who
                    was moreover incessantly wounded in the most sensitive part by the
                    representations of his friends that he was losing caste by the connexion. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Liberal</hi> lived through four quarterly numbers, containing
                    contributions no less memorable than Byron’s “Vision of Judgment” and Shelley’s
                    translations from <hi rend="italic">Faust·,</hi> but it produced little effect
                    on the whole, and in 1823 Byron sailed for Greece, leaving his coadjutor at
                    Genoa to shift for himself. The Italian climate and manners, however, were
                    entirely to Hunt’s taste, and he protracted his residence until 1825, producing
                    in the interim his matchless translation of Redi’s <hi rend="italic">Bacco in
                    Toscana,</hi> and the religious work subsequently published under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Religion of the Heart.</hi> In 1825 an unfortunate
                    litigation with his brother brought him back to England, and in 1827 he
                    committed the greatest mistake of his life by the publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lord Byron and his Contemporaries.</hi> The work is of
                    considerable value as a corrective of merely idealized estimates of Lord Byron.
                    But such a corrective should not have come from one who had lain under
                    obligations to Byron, however trifling, or however they might seem to be
                    cancelled by subsequent unkindness. Leigh Hunt should also have considered that
                    the materials for his estimate of Byron were chiefly afforded by a residence
                    under Byron’s own roof. Apart from its obvious impropriety, the publication in
                    itself is in general petty and carping. Hunt’s attitude towards Byron is always
                    that of the inferior; in proportion, therefore, as Byron is made to look small,
                    Hunt appears still smaller. The book’s reception was even more unfavourable than
                    its deserts. British manliness and British cant were for once equally shocked,
                    and the author especially writhed under the withering satire of Moore. For many
                    years ensuing, the history of Hunt’s life is that of a painful struggle with
                    poverty and sickness. He worked unremittingly, but one effort failed after
                    another. Two periodical ventures, the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> ∖A∖q*</hi><hi rend="italic">London Journal,</hi> were
                    discontinued for want of subscribers, although in the latter Leigh Hunt had able
                    coadjutors, and it contained some of his best writing. His editorship of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monthly Repository,</hi> in which he succeeded W. J. Fox, was also
                    unsuccessful. The adventitious circumstances which had for a time made the
                    fortune of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> no longer existed, and Hunt’s
                    strong and weak points, his refinement and his affectations, were alike unsuited
                    to the general body of readers. <hi rend="italic">Sir Ralph Esher,</hi> a
                    romance of Charles the Second’s period, was more successful, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Captain Sword and Captain Pen,</hi> a spirited contrast between
                    the victories of peace and the victories of war, deserves to be ranked among his
                    best poems. In 1840 his circumstances were improved by the successful
                    representation of his <hi rend="italic">Legend of Florence,</hi> a play of great
                    merit, although it has not maintained itself upon the stage. <hi rend="italic"

                    other plays are extant in MS. The pretty narrative poem of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Palfrey</hi> was published in 1842; and about this time he began to write for
                    the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> In 1844 he was further benefited by
                    the generosity of Mrs Shelley and her son, the present baronet, who, on
                    succeeding to the family estates, settled an annuity of £120 upon him; and in
                    1847 Lord John Russell procured him a civil list pension of £200. The fruits of
                    the improved comfort and augmented leisure of these latter years were visible in
                    the production of some charming volumes. Foremost among these are the companion
                    books, <hi rend="italic">Imagination and Fancy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wit
                    and Humour.</hi> In these Leigh Hunt shows himself as within a certain range the
                    most refined, appreciative, and felicitous of critics. Homer and Milton may be
                    upon the whole beyond his reach, though even here he is great in the detection
                    of minor and unapprehended beauties; with Spenser and the old English dramatists
                    he is perfectly at home, and his subtle and discriminating criticism upon them,
                    as well as upon his own great contemporaries, is continually bringing to light
                    beauties unsuspected by the reader, as they were probably undesigned by the
                    writer. His companion volume on the pastoral poetry of Sicily, quaintly entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">À</hi><hi rend="italic">Jar of Honey from Mount</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hybla,</hi> is almost equally delightful. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Town</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Men, Women, and Rooks</hi> are partly made up
                    from former material. The <hi rend="italic">Old Court Suburb</hi> is an
                    anecdotic sketch of Kensington, where he long resided before his final removal
                    to Hammersmith. In 1850 he published his autobiography, a naive and accurate
                    piece of self-portraiture, full of affectations, but on that very account free
                    from the affectation of unreality. It is more chary of portraits of
                    contemporaries than might have been expected, but contains very detailed
                    accounts of some of the most interesting periods of the author’s life, his
                    education at Christ’s Hospital, his imprisonment, and his residence in Italy. In
                    1855 his narrative poems, original and translated, were collected under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Stories in Verse,</hi> with an interesting preface.
                    He died at Putney, on August 28, 1859.</p>
                <p>The character of Leigh Hunt is not easy to delineate, not from any difficulty of
                    recognizing or harmonizing its leading features, but from that of depicting the
                    less admirable traits in a manner consistent with the affection and respect to
                    which it is entitled on the whole. His virtues were charming rather than
                    imposing or brilliant; he had no vices, but very many foibles. His great
                    misfortune was that these foibles were for the most part of an undignified sort,
                    and, though it may seem a paradox, that they were so harmless, and on so
                    miniature a scale. Leigh Hunt’s affectation, for example, is not comparable to
                    Byron’s, or his egotism to Wordsworth’s, and therefore its very pettiness
                    excites a sensation of the ludicrous which the colossal self-consciousness of
                    his contemporaries does not produce. The very sincerity of his nature is
                    detrimental to him; the whole man seems to be revealed in everything he ever
                    wrote, and hence the most beautiful productions of his pen appear in a manner
                    tainted by his really very pardonable weaknesses. Some of these, such as his
                    helplessness in money matters, and his facility in accepting the obligations
                    which he would have delighted to confer, were unfortunately of a nature to
                    involve him in painful and humiliating embarrassments, which seem to have been
                    aggravated by the mismanagement of those around him. The notoriety of these
                    things has deprived him of much of the honour due to him for his fortitude under
                    the severest calamities, for his unremitting literary industry under the most
                    discouraging circumstances, and for his uncompromising independence as a
                    journalist and an author. It was his misfortune to be involved in politics, for
                    which he had little vocation, and which embroiled him with many with whom he
                    would otherwise have been on good terms. “Though I was a politician,” he says
                    himself, “I had scarcely a political work in my library. Spensers and Arabian
                    Tales filled up the shelves.” He was in fact as thorough a man of letters as
                    ever existed, and most of his failings were more or less incidental to that
                    character. But it is not every consummate man of letters of whom it can be
                    unhesitatingly affirmed that he was brave, just, and pious.</p>
                <p>Leigh Hunt’s character as an author was the counterpart of his character as a
                    man. In some respects his literary position is unique. Few men have effected so
                    much by mere exquisiteness of taste in the absence of high creative power; fewer
                    still, so richly endowed with taste, have so frequently and conspicuously
                    betrayed the want of it. As Wordsworth could never see where simplicity of
                    poetic diction lapsed into mere prose, so Hunt was incapable of discovering
                    where familiarity became flippancy. While Wordsworth, however, is at worst
                    wearisome, Hunt is sometimes positively offensive to fastidious readers. This
                    observation principally refers to his poetry, which, in spite of such vexatious
                    flaws, nevertheless possesses a brightness, animation, artistic symmetry, and
                    metrical harmony, which lift the author out of the rank of minor poets,
                    particularly when the influence of his example upon his contemporaries is taken
                    into account. He excelled especially in narrative poetry, of which, upon a small
                    scale, there are probably no better examples in our language than “Abou ben
                    Adhem” and “Solomon’s Ring.” He possessed every qualification for a translator,
                    and it is to be regretted that his performances in that department are not more
                    numerous and sustained. As an appreciative critic, whether literary or dramatic,
                    he is hardly equalled; his guidance is as safe as it is genial. The no less
                    important vocation of a censor was uncongenial to his gentle nature, and was
