                    term in medicine applied to two different forms of disease of the brain, both of
                    which are attended with the effusion of fluid into its cavities. They are named
                    respectively <hi rend="italic">Acute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chronic
                    Hydrocephalus.</hi> They have different pathological associations, and have no
                    necessary connexion with each other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute Hydrocephalus</hi> is the term still largely employed to
                    describe the disease now known to physicians as tuber-c dar cerebral meningitis,
                    that is, inflammation of the membranes of the brain produced by the presence of
                    tubercle. This disease is most common in children under ten years of age, but is
                    by no means limited to that period of life, and may affect adults. The
                    scrofulous or tubercular constitution is an important factor in this malady,
                    which is admitted to be one of strongly hereditary tendency; yet unquestionably
                    there.are many instances in which no such taint can be traced. In numerous cases
                    it is manifestly connected with bad hygienic conditions, with insufficient or
                    improper feeding, or with over exercise of the mental powers, all of which will
                    doubtless more readily exert their influence where an inherited liability
                    exists, and the same may be said regarding its occasional occurrence as one of
                    the after consequences of certain of the diseases of childhood, especially
                    measles and hooping-cough.</p>
                <p>Acute hydrocephalus is usually described as passing through certain stages; but
                    it must be observed, as regards at least its earlier manifestations, that, so
                    far from being well defined, they are often exceedingly vague, and render this
                    disease in an especial manner liable to escape detection for a length of time,
                    or to be confounded with others to which at its commencement it bears an
                    acknowledged resemblance, such, for instance, as typhoid fever or
                    gastrointestinal derangements. Nevertheless, there are certain typical features
                    characterizing the disease in each of its stages which it is important to
                    describe, as in many instances· these present themselves with greater or less
                    distinctness.</p>
                <p>The premonitory symptoms of acute hydrocephalus are mostly such as relate to the
                    general nutrition. A falling off in flesh and failure of strength are often
                    observed for a considerable time before the characteristic phenomena of the
                    disease appear. The patient, if a child, becomes listless and easily fatigued,
                    loses appetite, and is restless at night. There is headache after exertion, and
                    the temper often undergoes a marked change, the child becoming unusually peevish
                    and irritable. These symptoms may persist during many weeks; but on the other
                    hand such premonitory indications may be entirely wanting, and the disease be
                    developed to all appearance quite suddenly.</p>
                <p>The onset is in most instances marked by the occurrence of vomiting, often
                    severe, but sometimes only slight, and there is in general obstinate
                    constipation. In not a few cases the first symptoms are convulsions, which,
                    however, may in this early stage subside, and remain absent, or reappear at a
                    later period. Headache is one of the most constant of the earlier. symptoms, and
                    is generally intense and accompanied with sharper paroxysms, which cause the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n447/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0447-0432"/> patient to scream, with a peculiar and
                    characteristic cry. There is great intolerance of light and sound, and general
                    nervous sensitiveness. Fever is present to a greater or less extent, the
                    temperature ranging from 100° to 103° Fahr.; yet the pulse is not quickened in
                    proportion, being on the contrary rather slow, but exhibiting a tendency to
                    irregularity, and liable to become rapid on slight exertion. The breathing, too,
                    is somewhat irregular. Symptoms of this character, constituting the stage of
                    excitement, continue for a period varying from one to two weeks, when they are
                    succeeded by the stage of depression. There is now a marked change in the
                    symptoms, which is apt to lead to the belief that a favourable turn has taken
                    place. The patient becomes quieter and inclines to sleep, but it will be found
                    on careful watching that this quietness is but a condition of apathy or partial
                    stupor into which the child has sunk. The vomiting has now ceased, and there is
                    less fever; the pulse is slower, and shows a still greater tendency to
                    irregularity than before, while the breathing is of markedly unequal character,
                    being rapid and shallow at one time, and long drawn out and sinking away at
                    another. There is manifestly little suffering, although the peculiar cry may
                    still be uttered, and the patient lies prostrate, occasionally rolling the head
                    uneasily upon the pillow, or picking at the bedclothes or at his face with his
                    fingers. He does not ask for food, but readily swallows what is offered. The
                    countenance is pale, but is apt to flush up suddenly for a time. The eyes
                    present important alterations, the pupils being dilated or unequal, and scarcely
                    responding to light. There may be double vision, or partial or complete
                    blindness. Squinting is common in this stage, and there may also be drooping of
                    an eyelid, due to paralysis of the part, and one or more limbs may be likewise
                    paralysed.</p>
                <p>To this succeeds the third or final stage, in which certain of the former
                    symptoms recur, while others become intensified. There is generally a return of
                    the fever, the temperature rising sometimes to a very -high degree. The pulse
                    becomes feeble, rapid, and exceedingly irregular, as is also the case with the
                    breathing. Coma is profound, but yet the patient may still be got to swallow
                    nourishment, though not so readily as before. Convulsions are apt to occur,
                    while paralysis, more or less extensive, affects portions of the body or groups
                    of muscles. The pupils are now widely dilated, and there is generally complete
                    blindness and often deafness. In this condition the patient’s strength undergoes
                    rapid decline, and the body becomes markedly emaciated. Death takes place either
                    suddenly in a fit, or more gradually from exhaustion. Shortly before the fatal
                    event it is not uncommon for the patient, who, it may be for many days
                    previously, lay in a state of profound stupor, to awake up, ask for food, and
                    talk to those around. But the hopes which may thus be raised are quickly
                    dispelled by the setting in of the symptoms of rapid sinking.</p>
                <p>The duration of a case of acute hydrocephalus varies somewhat, but in general
                    death takes place within three weeks from the onset of the symptoms. The disease
                    may be said to be almost invariably fatal, yet it must be admitted that cases
                    presenting all the principal symptoms of acute hydrocephalus do occasionally
                    recover, though such instances are undoubtedly very rare. Indeed, the condition
                    of the brain in this disease, as revealed on <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>
                    examination, renders its fatal character in no way surprising. The peculiar
                    formation called tubercle is found deposited in the membranes of the brain, more
                    particularly at its base. The irritation set up as a consequence of this is
                    accompanied with the effusion of fluid into the arachnoid and ventricles, which
                    by its pressure tends to produce softening and destruction of the brain
                    substance, and hence to abolish its functions. In many instances the brain is
                    found to be reduced to a state of complete disorganization.</p>
                <p>Besides this condition of the brain, there exists in most cases deposition of
                    tubercle elsewhere, as in the lungs and abdominal glands, and this may have
                    given evidence of its presence even before the head symptoms had appeared. This
                    is especially the case in adults, in whom acute hydrocephalus is more apt to
                    arise as a complication in the course of pulmonary or other disease of
                    tubercular origin than in the manner in which it occurs in children as above
                    described.</p>
                <p>With respect to treatment, little can be stated of an encouraging nature. Still
                    it must be observed that much may be done in the way· of prevention of this
                    disease, and, in its earlier stages, even in the way of cure. It is most
                    important in families where the history indicates a tuberculous or scrofulous
                    tendency, and particularly where acute hydrocephalus has already occurred, that
                    every effort should be used to fortify the system and avoid the causes already
                    alluded to as favouring the development of the disease during that period in
                    which children are liable to suffer from it. With this view wholesome food, warm
                    clothing, cleanliness, regularity, and the avoidance of overexertion, physical
                    and mental, are of the utmost consequence.</p>
                <p>Although there is but little that can be done when the disease has set in, yet
                    the timely use of remedies may mitigate and even occasionally remove the
                    symptoms. The severe headache may often be relieved by the application of one or
                    two leeches to the temples, and by the frequent use of cold water or ice applied
                    to the head. The treatment by blistering the scalp and administering mercury,
                    formerly so much practised, is now acknowledged to be of no real efficacy; and
                    on the whole the maintenance of the patient’s strength by light nourishment and
                    the use of sedatives to compose the nervous system are the measures most likely
                    to be attended with success. The bromide, with which may be combined the iodide
                    of potassium, is the medicinal agent of most value for this purpose. Should
                    convulsions occur, they are best treated by chloral or chloroform.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chronic Hydrocephalus</hi> is a different form of disease from
                    that last described, both as regards its pathology and its effects. It consists
                    in an effusion of fluid into the serous cavities (arachnoid and ventricles) of
                    the brain, not preceded by tuberculous deposit or acute inflammation, but
                    apparently depending on chronic inflammatory changes affecting the membranes,
                    and is to be regarded as a kind of dropsy. The disease is frequently congenital,
                    and its presence in the foetus is apt to be a source of difficulty in
                    parturition. It is, however, more commonly developed in the course of the first
                    six months of life; but it occasionally arises in older children, or even in
                    adults, as in the well-known instance of Dean Swift, who died from this
                    disease.</p>
                <p>Chronic hydrocephalus affects mostly children who bear evidence of a scrofulous,
                    ricketty, or otherwise delicate constitution. The chief symptoms observed are
                    the gradual increase in size of the upper part of the head out of all proportion
                    to tho face or the rest of the body. Occurring at an age when as yet the
                    separate bones constituting the skull havo not become welded, this enlargement
                    may go on to a very considerable extent in all directions, but chiefly in the
                    transverse and antero-posterior diameters, tho spaces between the bones becoming
                    more and more expanded, though ultimately, should the child survive,
                    ossification takes place. In a well-marked case the deformity is very striking.
                    The upper part of the forehead projects abnormally, and the orbital plates of
                    the frontal bone being inclined forwards give a downwaιd direction to the eyes,
                    which have also peculiar rolling movements. The face is small, and this, with
                    the enlarged <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n448/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0448-0433"/> head, gives a remarkably aged expression to the
                    child. There is generally defective development in other respects, the body
                    being ill nourished, the bones thin, the hair scanty and fine, and the teeth
                    carious or absent.</p>
                <p>As illustrating the extent to which this disease may proceed, it may be mentioned
                    that the average circumference of the adult head is about 22 inches, while in
                    the child it is of course considerably less. In chronic hydrocephalus the head
                    of an infant three months old has been known to measure 29 inches; and in the
                    well-known case of the man Cardinal, who died in Guy’s Hospital, the head
                    measured 33 inches. In the museum of the faculty of medicine in Paris there is a
                    hydrocephalic skull measuring 39 inches. In aggravated cases the head cannot be
                    supported by the neck, and the patient has to keep in the recumbent posture. The
                    expansibility of the skull prevents destructive pressure on the brain, yet this
                    organ is materially affected by the presence of the fluid. The cerebral
                    ventricles are widely distended, and the convolutions flattened, while
                    occasionally the fluid escapes into the cavity of the cranium, which it fills,
                    pressing down the brain to the base of the skull. As a consequence of such
                    changes, the functions of the brain are interfered with, and in general the
                    mental condition of the patient is impaired to a greater or less extent. The
                    child is dull and listless, irritable, and sometimes imbecile. The special
                    senses become affected as the disease advances, especially vision, and sight is
                    often lost, as is also hearing. Towards the close paralysis is apt to occur.
                    Hydrocephalic children rarely live long, generally dying from the malady in a
                    few years, or succumbing to some of the disorders of childhood, which they are
                    little able to resist. Nevertheless there have been many instances of persons
                    with this disease reaching maturity, and even living to old age. It must also be
                    borne in mind that there are grades of this affection, and that children may
                    present many of the symptoms of it in a comparatively slight degree, and yet
                    recover, the head ceasing to expand, and becoming firmly ossified.</p>
                <p>Various methods of treatment have been employed in this disease, but the results
                    are seldom satisfactory. Compression of the head by bandages, and the
                    administration of mercury with the view of promoting absorption of the fluid,
                    are now little resorted to. Tapping the fluid from time to time through one of
                    the spaces between the bones, drawing off a little, and thereafter employing
                    gentle pressure, has been tried, but seldom with permanent benefit. On the
                    whole, the plan of treatment which aims at maintaining the patient’s nutrition
                    by appropriate food and tonics, is at once the most rational and successful,
                    provided it be resorted to in time to admit of the arrest of the progress of the
                    symptoms. (j. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.)</hi></p>
