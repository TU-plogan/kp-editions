                    (1740-1828), was the most distinguished sculptor produced by France in the
                    latter half of the 18th century. He was born at Versailles in 1740, and at the
                    age of nineteen, having learnt all that he could from Michel Ange Slodtz and
                    Pigalle, Houdon carried off the prix de Rome and left France for Italy, where he
                    spent the next ten years of his life. His brilliant talent, which seems to have
                    been formed by the influence of that world of statues with which Louis XIV.
                    peopled the gardens of Versailles rather than by the lessons of his masters,
                    delighted Clement XIV., who, on seeing the St Bruno executed by Houdon for the
                    church of St Maria degli Angeli, said “he would speak, were it not that the
                    rules of his order impose silence.” In Italy Houdon had lived in the presence of
                    that second Renaissance with which the name of Winckelmann is. for ever
                    associated, and the direct and simple treatment of the Morpheus which he sent to
                    the Salon of 1771 bore witness to its influence. This work procured him his
                    “agrégation” to the Academy of Painting and Sculpture, of which he was made a
                    full member in 1775. Between these dates Houdon had not been idle; busts of
                    Catharine II., Diderot, and Prince Galitzin were remarked at the Salon of 1773,
                    and at that of 1775 he produced, not only his Morpheus in marble, but busts of
                    Turgot, Gluck, and Sophie Arnould, together with his well-known marble relief,
                    “Grive suspendue par les pattes.” He took also an active part in the teaching of
                    the academy, and executed for the instruction of his pupils the celebrated
                    Écorché still in use. To every Salon Houdon was a chief contributor; most of the
                    leading men of the day were his sitters; his busts of D’Alembert, Prince Henry
                    of Prussia, Gerbier, Buffon (for Catharine of Russia), and Mirabeau are amongst
                    the most remarkable portraits of modern times; and in 1778, when the news of
                    Rousseau’s death reached him, Houdon started at once for Ermenonville, and there
                    took a cast of the dead man’s face, from which he produced the grand and
                    lifelike head at present in the Louvre. The celebrated draped statue of
                    Voltaire, now in the vestibule of the Théâtre Français, was exhibited at the
                    Salon of 1781, to which Houdon also sent a statue of Marshal de Tourville,
                    commissioned by the king, and the Diana executed for Catharine IT. This work was
                    refused; the jury alleged that a statue of Diana demanded drapery; without
                    drapery, they said, the goddess became a “suivante de Vénus,” and not even the
                    proud and frank chastity of the attitude and expression could save the Diana of
                    Houdon (a bronze reproduction of which is now in the Louvre) from insult.
                    Whether Houdon felt annoyance at this folly does not appear; but three years
                    later he very readily accepted an invitation to go to America, there to carry
                    out a statue of Washington. With Franklin, whose bust he had recently executed,
                    Houdon left France in 1785, and, staying some time with Washington at
                    Philadelphia, he modelled the bust, with which he decided to go back to Paris,
                    there to complete the statue destined for the assembly hall of the State of
                    Virginia. After his return to his native country Houdon executed for the king of
                    Prussia, as a companion to a statue of Summer, La Frileuse, a naif embodiment of
                    shivering cold, which is one of his best as well as one of his best-known works.
                    The Revolution interrupted the busy flow of commissions, and Houdon took up a
                    half-forgotten project for a statue of St Scholastica, which had long been put
                    on one side in a corner of his studio. He was immediately denounced to the
                    convention, and his life was only saved by his instant and ingenious adaptation
                    of St Scholastica into an embodiment of Philosophy. Under Napoleon, Houdon
                    received little employment; he was, however, commissioned to execute the
                    colossal reliefs intended for the decoration of the column of the “Grand Army”
                    at Boulogne (but which ultimately found a different destination); he also
                    produced a statue of Cicero for the senate, and various busts, amongst which may
                    be cited those of Marshal Ney, of Josephine, and of Napoleon himself, by whom
                    Houdon was rewarded with the legion of honour. After the fall of the first
                    empire Houdon suddenly aged; he lost his memory, and slept away the closing
                    years of his life. He died at Paris in 1828.</p>
                <p>The most striking characteristic of his work is the life by which it is animated,
                    and which is the result of marvellous skill in execution and keenness in
                    observation. He was, in all he did, great. His bust of Voltaire is deservedly
                    one of the most famous in the whole range of modern sculpture, and his genial
                    reading of Rousseau—a splendid yet brute virility tempered with the gift of
                    tears —is a masterpiece of insight into character. But Houdon’s power was no
                    less triumphant in rendering the beauty of youth and the beauty of beautiful
                    women. His Diana proved that he could penetrate the secret of an ideal of noble
                    womanhood; his heads of young girls have been compared with the graceful
                    children of his contemporary Greuze, but the innocent candour of Houdon’s work
                    is entirely free from the self-consciousness which disturbs the charm of La
                    Cruche Cassée and her companions. Finally, Houdon cannot be claimed, like
                    Greuze, as representing the popular tendencies of the society to which he
                    belonged; for, whereas Greuze, like most men, bore the stamp of his time on all
                    he did, Houdon was one of those rare spirits who, doing the work of their own
                    time, set their own seal tnereto.</p>
