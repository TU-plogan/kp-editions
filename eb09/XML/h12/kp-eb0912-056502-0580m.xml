                <p><label type="entry">HYERES</label>, a town of France, in the department of Var
                    and arrondissement of Toulon, about 3 miles from the coast of the Mediterranean.
                    It is connected by a branch line with the railway from Toulon to Cannes, and by
                    diligences with the neighbouring towns. The town proper is situated on the
                    south-eastern side of a steep hill (650 feet high) which forms one of the last
                    buttresses of the Maurettes, a group of picturesque hills covered with olive,
                    pine, and cork trees, and underwood of myrtles and other shrubs. In front,
                    towards the south and south-east, a fertile plain, once famous for its orange
                    groves, and now mainly occupied by vineyards and farms, stretches to the sea,
                    while towards the south-west, across a narrow valley, rises a cluster of low but
                    well-clad hills. The older part of the town, still on its eastern and northern
                    sides surrounded by its ancient and dilapidated wall, is a labyrinth of steep
                    dirty streets; but the new quarters which have grown up at the foot of the hill
                    have handsome boulevards and villas, many of them with beautiful gardens full of
                    semi-tropical plants. Of best note among the objects of interest at Hyères are
                    the house (Rue Rabaton, No. 7) where Massillon was born; the cathedral or church
                    of St Louis, a low building of the 12th century (restored in 1840), which
                    belonged to the Cordeliers; and the ancient castle, crowning the highest part of
                    the hill. The Place des Palmiers takes its name from the seven palm trees
                    planted there in 1834. On the plain between the town and the sea are large
                    nurseries, an excellent jardin d’acclimatation, and the famed kitchen gardens
                    which supply Paris with early fruits and vegetables and with roses in winter.

                    Mediterranean, where salt is made by the exposure of the sea-water to the sun.
                    Up to the 14th century Hyères was a larger and more important town than Toulon;
                    and in the 16th century it became famous as a winter resort. Catherine de’
                    Medici at one time thought of making it the seat of a royal residence. At
                    present the more brilliant social attractions of some of the neighbouring
                    watering-places of the Riviera divert the more fashionable visitors from Hyères.
                    In climate it differs little from its more favoured compeers. From the east and
                    north-east winds it is completely sheltered, but it lies open to the ravages of
                    the mistral. The population in 1872 was returned at 5881 for the town and
                    11,21*2 for the commune; in 1876 the corresponding figures were 6797 and 12,289.

                    classical geographers), otherwise called Les îles d’Or, lie to the east of the
                    peninsula of Giens, and form a protection to the roads of Hyères, one of the
                    great rendezvous of the French fleets. The principal islands are Porquerolles,
                    which rises to a height of 600 feet, Port-cros, and Titan. The population is
                    scanty. A marquisate of the îles d’Or was created by Francis I.</p>
