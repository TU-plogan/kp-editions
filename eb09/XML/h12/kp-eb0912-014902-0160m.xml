                    an original and ingenious experimental philosopher, was born at Freshwater, in
                    the Isle of Wight, July 18, 1635. His father, who was minister of the parish,

                    Westminster School; and there his education progressed with surprising rapidity
                    both in its classical and mathematical branches. In 1653 he entered Christ
                    Church, Oxford, as servitor; and ten years later he took his M.A. degree by
                    special recommendation of Lord Clarendon, then chancellor of the university.
                    After 1655 he was employed and patronized by the Hon. Robert Boyle, who turned
                    his skill to account in the construction of his celebrated air-pump. Hooke’s
                    inventive faculty exercised itself, between 1657 and 1659, in devising tlιirty
                    different methods of flying, and more profitably in regulating the movement of
                    watches by the application of the balance spring. In 1675 a lively controversy
                    arose between him and Huygens respecting their rival claims to this ingenious
                    invention. The truth seems to be that the original idea belonged to Hooke, but
                    that the coiled form of the spring, on which its practical utility depends, was
                    due to Huygens. On the 12th of November 1662 Hooke was appointed curator of
                    experiments to the Royal Society, and filled the office with extraordinary
                    diligence and skill during the remainder of his life. In 1664 Sir John Cutler
                    instituted for his benefit a mechanical lectureship of £50 a year, and in the
                    following year he was nominated professor of geometry in Gresham College, where
                    he subsequently resided. After the great fire of 1666 he constructed a model for
                    the rebuilding of the city, which was highly approved, although the design of
                    Wren was preferred. During the progress of the works, however, Hooke acted as
                    surveyor, aud accumulated in that lucrative employment a sum of several thousand
                    pounds, discovered after his death in an old iron chest, which had evidently
                    lain unopened for above thirty years. He fulfilled the duties of secretary to
                    the Royal Society during five years after the death of Oldenburg in 1677,
                    publishing in 1681-82 the papers read before that body under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Collections.</hi> A protracted controversy with
                    Hevelius, in which Hooke urged the advantages of telescopic over plain sights,
                    brought him little but discredit. His reasons were good; but his offensive style
                    of argument rendered them unpalatable and himself unpopular. Many circumstances
                    concurred to embitter the latter years of his life. The death, in 1687, of his
                    niece, Mrs Grace Hooke, who had lived with him for many years, caused him deep
                    affliction; a law suit with Sir John Cutler about his salary (decided, however,
                    in his favour in 1696) occasioned him prolonged anxiety; and the repeated
                    anticipation of his discoveries inspired him with a morbid jealousy. Marks of
                    public respect were not indeed wanting to him. A degree of M.D. was conferred on
                    him at Doctors’ Commons, December 7, 1691, and the Royal Society made him, in
                    1696, a grant to enable him to complete his philosophical inventions. While
                    engaged on this task he died, worn out with disease and toil, March 3, 1703, and
                    was buried in St Helen’s Church, Bishopsgate Street.</p>
                <p>In personal appearance Hooke made but a sorry show. His figure was crooked, his
                    limbs shrunken; his hair hung in dishevelled locks over his haggard countenance.
                    His temper was irritable, his habits penurious and solitary. He was, however,
                    blameless in morals, and reverent in religion. His scientific performances would
                    probably have been more striking if they had been less varied. He originated
                    much, but perfected little. His optical investigations<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0161-0150"/> led him to adopt in an imperfect form the
                    undulatory theory of light, to anticipate the doctrine of interference, and to
                    observe, independently of though subsequently to Grimaldi, the phenomenon of
                    diffraction. He was the first to state clearly that the motions of the heavenly
                    bodies must be regarded as a mechanical problem, and he approached in a
                    remarkable manner the discovery of universal gravitation. He suggested a method
                    of meteorological forecasting and a system of telescopic signalling, anticipated
                    Chladni’s experiment of strewing a vibrating bell with flour, investigated the
                    nature of sounds and the function of· the air in respiration and combustion, and
                    originated the idea of using the pendulum as a measure of gravity.</p>
