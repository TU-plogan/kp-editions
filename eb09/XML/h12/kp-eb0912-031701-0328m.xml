                    that its lack of salient external features would puzzle any but a profound
                    dipterologist to define its specific attributes with absolute certainty; the
                    other, that its earlier life history and transformations remained practically
                    unknown (at all events to ordinary readers) up to the year 1873. It is scarcely
                    witbin the province of this work to diagnose species; the instincts of the
                    majority of readers will probably direct them at once to the right insect, which
                    may be roughly described as a quarter of an inch long, black, hairy, with a
                    reddish oval vertical spot and golden orbits, three grey longitudinal bands on
                    the thorax, an interrupted yellowish band at the base of the abdomen, which has
                    lateral and apical golden spots, and the base of the wings yellowish-white. But
                    not only allied species are liable to be confused with the house-fly;
                    representatives of other genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Anthomyia,
                    Tachina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stomoxys,</hi> are often mistaken for it,
                    and a puncture from the sharp beak of the latter fly has often caused a wrong
                    charge of blood-sucking to be brought against the subject of this notice, which
                    has a short fleshy bilobed tongue incapable of penetrating the skin, though
                    provided with a terminal framework of tracheal tubes, acting like a rasp, by
                    using which it often annoys us in the heat of summer. As regards the second
                    point, Linnaeus, who first named the fly, left its transformations undescribed;
                    De Geer in 1776, and Bouché in 1834, described the larva and pupa, and correctly
                    defined their habitat; but it has been reserved for Dr A. S. Packard, jun., the
                    well-known American entomologist and biologist, to make a thorough investigation
                    of their whole economy, which he has published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History,</hi> vol. xvi. (for
                    1873-74), pp. 136-150, pl. iii.</p>
                <p>The minute dull chalky white eggs (usually about 120 in number), elongate oval
                    and cylindrical in shape, are laid by the parent fly in crevices of fresh manure
                    in or about stables,—heat, and especially moisture, being required for their
                    development. The larvae are hatched in twenty-four hours, and pass through three
                    stages, averaging from five to seven days in all; in the second of its stages,
                    the larva has been observed to increase by one-third of its length in
                    twenty-four hours. They resemble those of the well-known meat fly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Calliphora</hi><hi rend="italic">vomitoria,</hi> but are
                    smaller,longer, more slender, transparent, smooth, and shining, and regularly
                    éonical. The prop-leg at the apex is also much smaller, and cannot be seen from
                    above when the larva is in motion. They eat the decaying parts of the manure,
                    leaving the bits of hay and straw. The puparium, or pupacase, is a quarter of an
                    inch long, cylindrical, and dark brown, closely resembling that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Stomoxys</hi><hi rend="italic">calcitrans,</hi> from which it
                    chiefly differs in the larger and squarer anal spiracles and the smoother apex.
                    The enclosed pupa is of the usual type of the cyclorhaphous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diptera,</hi> and is readily distinguishable from that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stomoxys</hi> by its broad spatulate labium and curved maxillary palpi; it
                    rests in the case with the hard framework of the jaws of the old larva skin next
                    the ventral side; and when the fly pushes its way out, after remaining from five
                    to seven days as a pupa, the upper end of the case splits off just behind the
                    suture between the thorax and abdomen. The term “pupa” is here used in a general
                    sense, since intermediate stages of development (variously called “pseudo-nymph”
                    or “semi-pupa”) in that condition occur in the <hi rend="italic">Muscidae,</hi>
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera, Colcoptcra,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>On leaving the pupa-case, the fly runs about with its wings soft, small, and
                    baggy, pressed to the side of the body, much as in the pupa. It is pale, with
                    the colours not set, and the membranous portion of its forehead constantly
                    distends with air as the fly moves, being connected with the tracheae. From Mr
                    Lowne’s observations on the anatomy of the blow-fly, this organ is evidently
                    employed for pushing away the end of the puparium when the pupa slips out of its
                    case.</p>
                <p>The whole period of evolution being thus from ten to fourteen days only, and the
                    number of eggs laid by each female fly so numerous, it will be readily seen that
                    any slight personal inconvenience to man, as produced by the habits of the
                    perfect insect, are much more than compensated for by the unceasing labours of
                    its larvae as scavengers; the benefit being the more direct as the work is
                    invariably done close to human habitations. The workings of the law of nature,
                    by which an excess of increase in any one species is checked, are conspicuously
                    shown in the case of this insect. Not only do the ordinary parasites of its own
                    class (some Hymenopterous, and in one recorded instance Coleopterous) attack it
                    in its earlier stages, but certain common birds are particularly addicted to it
                    in the perfect state (in which also a <hi rend="italic">Chelifer,</hi> a minute
                    European representative of the scorpions, has also been found parasitically
                    attached to it). The vegetable world also supplies some lethal agents in the
                    shape of fungi (notably <hi rend="italic">Empusa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >muscae),</hi> individuals destroyed by which are constantly to be seen in
                    autumn unable to move, and distended or ruptured by the expansion of the
                    internal-growth, the white spores of which are finally to be observed scattered
                    round their victim.</p>
                <p>Trivial as the house-fly may appear even to entomologists, it is to be noted that
                    recent observations by the German biologist Weissman on its development have
                    resulted in his discovery of its possessing “imaginai discs” in the early larval
                    state—a structure deemed of sufficient value to suggest a new division of the
                    whole <hi rend="italic">Insecta</hi> into “Discota” and “Adiscota.”</p>
