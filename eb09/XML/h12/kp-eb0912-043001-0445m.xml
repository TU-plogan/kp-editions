                    axis of the island, which runs from southwest to north-east, is about 11 miles,
                    and the area is about 21 square miles; but it is little better than a rocky and
                    treeless ridge with hardly a patch or two of arable soil. There was little
                    exaggeration in the reply made by Antonios Kriezes to the queen of Greece: “The
                    island produces prickly pears in abundance, splendid sea captains, and excellent
                    pripιe ministers.” The highest point, Mount Ere, so called (according to
                    Miaoules) from the Albanian word for wind, has an elevation of 1958 feet. The
                    next in importance is known as the Prophet Elias, from the large convent of that
                    name on its summit. It was there that the patriot Theodoras Colocotronis was
                    imprisoned, and a large pine tree is still called after him. The fact that in
                    former times the island was richly clad with woods is indicated by the name
                    still employed by the Turks, <hi rend="italic">Tcharnliza,</hi> the place of
                    pines; but it is only in some favoured spots that a few trees are now to be
                    found. Tradition also has it that it was once a well-watered island (hence the
                    designation Hydrea), but the inhabitants are now wholly dependent on the rain
                    supply, and they have sometimes had to bring water from the mainland. This lack
                    of fountains is probably to be ascribed in part to the effect of earthquakes,
                    which are not infrequent; that of 1769 continued for six whole days. Hydra, the
                    chief town, is built near the middle of the northern coast, on a very irregular
                    site, consisting of three hills and the intervening ravines. From the sea its
                    white and handsome houses present a picturesque and noble appearance, and its
                    streets though narrow are clean and attractive. Besides the principal harbour,
                    round which the town is built, there are three other ports on the north
                    coast—Mandraki, Molo, Panagia, but none of them is sufficiently sheltered.
                    Almost all the population of the island is collected in the chief town, which is
                    the seat of a bishop, and has a local court, numerous churches, and a high
                    school. Cotton and silk weaving, tanning, and shipbuilding are carried on, and
                    there is a fairly active trade. The population in 1877 was 6811.</p>
                <p>Hydra was of no importance in ancient times. The only fact in its history is that
                    the people of Hermione (a city on the neighbouring mainland now known by the
                    common name of <hi rend="italic">Kastrï)</hi> surrendered it to Samian refugees,
                    and that from these the people of Troezen received it in trust. It appears to be
                    completely ignored by the Byzantine chroniclers. In 1580 it was chosen as a
                    refuge by a body of Albanians from Ko⅛inyas in Troezenia; and other emigrants
                    followed in 1590, 1628, 1635, 1640, &amp;c. At the close of the 17th <pb

                    commerce of the Peloponnesus; and in course of time they extended their range.
                    About 1716 they began to build <hi rend="italic">sakturia</hi> (of from 10 to 15
                    tons burden), and to visit the islands of the Aegean; not long after they
                    introduced the <hi rend="italic">latinadika</hi> (40-50 tons), and sailed as far
                    as Alexandria, Constantinople, Trieste, and Venice; and by and by they ventured
                    to France and even America. From the grain trade of South Russia more especially
                    they derived great wealth. In 1813 there were about 22,000 people in the island,
                    and of these 10,000 were seafarers. At the time of the outbreak of the war of
                    Greek independence the total population was 28,190, of whom 16,460 were natives
                    and the rest foreigners. One of their chief families, the Konduriotti, was worth
                    £2,000,000. Into the struggle the Hydriotes flung themselves with rare
                    enthusiasm and devotion, and the final deliverance of Greece was mainly due to
                    the service rendered by their fleets.</p>
