                    >Hiang-Klang</hi> (the place of “sweet streams”), an important British
                    island-possession, situated off the south-east coast of China, opposite the
                    province of Kwang-tung, on the east side of the estuary of the Chu-Kiang or
                    Canton river, 38 miles east of Macao and 75 south-east of Canton, between 22° 9'
                    and 22° Γ N. lat. and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. It is one of a small cluster
                    named by the Portuguese “Ladrones” or Thieves, on account of the notorious
                    habits of their old inhabitants. Extremely irregular in outline, it has an area
                    of 29 square miles, measuring 10⅜ miles in extreme length from northeast to
                    south-west, and varying in breadth from 2 to 5 miles. From the mainland it is
                    separated by a narrow channel, which at Hong-Kong roads, between Victoria, the
                    island capital, and Kau-lung Point, is about one mile broad, and which narrows
                    at Ly-ce-moon Pass to little over a quarter of a mile. The southern coast in
                    particular is deeply indented; and there two bold peninsulas, extending for
                    several miles into the sea, form two capacious natural harbours, namely, Deep
                    Water Bay, with the village of Stanley to the east, and Tytam Bay, which has a
                    safe, well-protected entrance showing a depth of 10 to 16 fathoms. An in-shore
                    island on the west coast, called Aberdeen or Taplichan, affords protection to
                    the Shekpywan or Aberdeen harbour, an inlet provided with a granite graving
                    dock, the caisson gate of which is 60 feet wide, and the Hope dock, opened in
                    1867, with a length of 425 feet and a depth of 24 feet. Opposite the same part
                    of the coast, but nearly 2 miles distant, rises the largest of the surrounding
                    islands, the Lamma, whose conspicuous peak, Mount Stenhouse, attains a height of
                    1140 feet, and is a landmark for local navigation. On the northern shore of Hong
                    Kong there is a patent slip at East or Matheson Point, which is serviceable
                    during the north-east monsoon, when sailing vessels frequently approach Victoria
                    through the Ly-ce-moon Pass. The ordinary course for such vessels is from the
                    westward, on which side they are sheltered by Green Island and Kellett Bank.
                    There is good anchorage throughout the entire channel separating the island from
                    the mainland, except in the Ly-ce-moon Pass, where the water is deep; the best
                    anchorage is in HongKong roads, in front of Victoria, where, over good holding
                    ground, the depth is 5 to 9 fathoms. The inner anchorage of Victoria Bay, about
                    half a mile off shore and out of the strength of the tide, is 6 to 7 fathoms.
                    Victoria, the seat alike of government and of trade, is the chief centre of
                    population, but in recent years a tract of 4 square miles on the mainland has
                    been covered with public buildings and villa residences. Practically an outlying
                    suburb of Victoria, Kau-lung (Nine Dragons), or as it is commonly called
                    Kowloon, is free from the extreme heat of the capital, being exposed to the
                    south-west monsoon. Numerous villas have also been erected along the beautiful
                    western coast of the island, while Stanley, in the south, has lately been
                    attracting attention by its excellent qualifications as a watering-place.</p>
                <p>The island is mountainous throughout, the low granite ridges, parted by bleak,
                    tortuous valleys, leaving in some places a narrow stripe of level coast-]and,
                    and in others overhanging the sea in lofty precipices. From the sea, and
                    especially from the magnificent harbour which faces the capital, the general
                    aspect of Hong-Kong is one of singular beauty. With something of the rugged
                    grandeur of the western Scottish isles, and a suggestion of Italian softness and
                    grace, it is distinguished by unmistakable traces of a purely tropical
                    character. Inland the prospect is wild, dreary, and monotonous. The hills have a
                    painfully bare appearance from the want of trees. The streams, which are
                    plentiful, are traced through the uplands and glens by a line of straggling
                    brushwood and rank herbage. Nowhere is the eye relieved by the grateful
                    evidences of cultivation or fertility. The mountains, which are mainly composed
                    of granite, serpentine, and syenite, rise in irregular masses to considerable
                    heights, the loftiest point, Victoria Peak, reaching an altitude of 1825 feet.
                    The Peak lies immediately to the south-west of the capital, in the extreme
                    north-west corner of the island, and is used as a station for signalling the
                    approach of vessels. Patches of land, chiefly around the coast, have been laid
                    under rice, sweet potatoes, and yams, but the island is hardly able to raise a
                    home-supply<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n153/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0153-0142"/> of vegetables. The mango, lichen, pear, and
                    orange are indigenous, and to these the English have added several fruits and
                    esculents. One of the chief products is buildingstone, which is quarried by the
                    Chinese. The animals are few, comprising a land tortoise, the armadillo, a
                    species of boa, several poisonous snakes, and some woodcock. The public works
                    suffer from the ravages of white ants. Water everywhere abounds, and is supplied
                    to the shipping by means of tanks. Hong-Kong acquired the name of an extremely
                    unhealthy place at the time of settlement, but it has been found that the
                    mortality is only high in certain seasons. It is not free from a certain malaria
                    which, according to Montgomery Martin, is thrown off by the decomposed rocks
                    that have been baked by a strong sun during the day. The change from the heat
                    and rain of summer (May to October) to the refreshing temperature of the cool
                    season tends to produce disease of the kidneys, &amp;c. During the years 1871-75
                    the mean temperature was 73° Fahr, in the shade, and the range from 56° to 84°,
                    taking the mean readings for the months. Occasionally the thermometer registers
                    below 40°, and on 26th February 1876, when extreme cold was experienced, water
                    was frozen to the thickness of I of an inch. The annual rainfall was 99 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 24 inches in 1871 and 83 ’ 43 in 1875. The
                    population, which in 1841 was only 5000, had increased to 21,514 in 1848, to
                    37,058 in 1852, to 123,511 in 1862, and to 139,144 in 1876. According to the
                    census of 1872, there were of Europeans and Americans 5931, of Chinese 115,444,
                    and of natives of India, Goa, Manila, &amp;c., 2623. Victoria was the residence
                    of almost all the Europeans, and of the Chinese 83,487 (14,269 women) resided
                    there, including a boat population of 12,309, while 10,507 resided in Kau-lung
                    and other villages, and 11,400 were scattered along the coast in boats.</p>
                <p>Formerly an integral part of China, the island was first ceded to Great Britain
                    in 1841, and the cession was confirmed by the treaty of Nanking in 184*2, the
                    charter bearing date 5th April 1843. Kau-lung, temporarily occupied for several
                    years as a military sanatarium, was ceded by a treaty contracted by Lord Elgin
                    in 1861. The colony is under a governor, and an executive council comprising the
                    colonial secretary, the commander of the troops, the attorney-general, and the
                    auditor-general. The legislative council, presided over by the governor, is
                    composed of all these officials (except the commander), with the addition of
                    four unofficial members, nominated by the crown on the recommendation of the
                    governor. The occupation of Hong-Kong was effected at a considerable outlay, but
                    the parliamentary vote on its behalf was reduced from £50,000 in 1845 to £9200
                    in 1853, and since 1855 the colony has paid its local establishments. In 1868 it
                    extinguished its debt, which had dwindled to £15,625, and it now pays £20,000 a
                    year as military contribution to the imperial exchequer.</p>
                <p>The capital, situated at the north-west extremity of the island, is laid out in
                    fine wide streets and terraces. The buildings, mostly of stone and brick, are
                    greatly superior to those of a Chinese city. The merchants’ houses are elegant
                    and spacious, with broad verandahs and tasteful gardens. Including the Chinese
                    town, Victoria extends for 3 miles along the bay, towards which it slopes from
                    the base of the hills. It is lighted with gas, and supplied with water from the
                    Pokovfulun reservoir, which impounds 74 million gallons. The main thoroughfare
                    is protected by a massive seawall, and the appearance of the Town has been
                    greatly improved by the construction of public gardens. Besides several handsome
                    Government buildings, Victoria has a large exchange, a cathedral and bishop’s
                    palace, several good hospitals, extensive barracks, and a few higher class
                    schools. A city hall with library and museum was opened in 1876, and the public
                    works completed in that year (the extension of public gardens, construction of
                    many miles of mountain Îath, and improvement of drainage) involving an outlay of
                    £30,867.</p>
                <p>he educational provision of the Government in 1876 comprised 54 schools, with an
                    attendance of 3111 pupils, and of these 16 with 1816 pupils were native schools,
                    in which the language is Chinese. At the central school (556 pupils in 1876)
                    there is a Chinese class for Europeans, as there is also in several of the
                    missionary and “grant-in-aid” schools. Hong-Kong publishes, in addition to 5
                    English newspapers (2 daily), 1 in Chinese every second day and a Portuguese
                    weekly. The streets are guarded by a strong force of Indian sepoys, and the
                    natives are not allowed to go abroad after 8 o’clock at night without a pass;
                    but the general character of the town is orderly, as is attested by the police
                    returns, from which it appears that only 68 persons were convicted before the
                    superior courts in 1875. The common mode of street conveyance is by chairs,
                    which are carried by coolies, while the passage across to Kau-lung is usually
                    effected in sampans or pull-away boats. Victoria has a few slight industries,
                    including sugar-refining, rum-distilling, and ice-making. In 1877 the
                    introduction of a steam laundry broke the monopoly of the dhoby. There are
                    upwards of 500 Chinese hongs of a superior class belonging to ship compradores
                    and to dealers in fancy goods, china ware, articles in gold and silver, opium
                    and other drugs, rice, piece goods, tea, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Although formerly the central point of the great European Chinese trade and still
                    a thriving seat of commerce, Hong-Kong owes its present importance chiefly to
                    its financial prominence as the headquarters of the banking interest, and to its
                    magnificent harbour, which makes it both the station of the British fleet and an
                    entrepot for the custom trade of all nations. In 1877 it was the residence of 14
                    foreign consuls, and had 10 large banking-houses. It still imports opium more
                    largely than any other port, and among other articles of which it is the centre
                    of trade are sugar, flour, salt, china ware, nut-oil, amber, cotton, sandalwood,
                    ivory, betel, live stock, granite, and ship supplies. The principal transactions
                    in tea and silk are controlled by firms residing in Hong-Kong. As it is a free
                    port there are no exact returns of trade, but in 1877 the imports from Great
                    Britain alone amounted to £3,645,068 and the exports thither to £1,895,310.
                    Chief of these exports was tea, the value of which in 1876 was £839,568. In the
                    same year the opium imported amounted to 96,985 piculs, as compared with 69,851
                    piculs received at all the other treaty ports. Of 3424 chests of Bengal opium
                    imported in February 1876, 1500 passed into the hands of local consumers and
                    1924 were exported; at the same date there were 4800 chests in stock as compared
                    with 1374 at Shanghai. There is an enormous passenger traffic: between the years
                    1871 and 1876 there have passed through the port no fewer than 15,000 Chinese
                    coolies, of whom the majority have gone to the United States. In the year 1876
                    Queensland drafted hence as many as 8325 emigrants. Large steamers go and come
                    almost daily, the ports in regular communication with Hong-Kong including
                    Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Canton, San Francisco, Yokohama, and (since 1875)
                    Sydney. The aggregate shipping that entered the port in 1878 amounted to
                    3,900,891 tons. Of this 45'2 per cent, were junks, 43'7 steamers, and 11 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 1 European and American built sailing vessels.
                    Exclusive of native craft there entered and cleared (1876) 4,359,616 tons, of
                    which 3,150,952 were in British and 1,208,664 in foreign vessels. The revenue in
                    1878, derived from land rents, fines, licences to sell opium, and spirits,
                    &amp;c., amounted to £197,424, the expenditure to £189,695; there is usually a
                    surplus of revenue. At the 31st January 1877 the bank-notes in circulation were
                    stated at $3,536,380, and the specie in reserve at $1,295,000. Hong-Kong has a
                    dollar of its own coining (4s. 2d.), but its mint, which entailed a cost of
                    £9,000 a year, has ceased to operate. Other coins in circulation are the Mexican
                    dollar, Chinese taels and cash, the American trade dollar, and Japanese silver
                    yen. A movement is at present on foot to have the last two coins placed on an
                    equality with the Mexican dollar. The standard of value is 1000 Mexican dollars
                    to 717 taels by weight. In spite of the great increase in recent years of the
                    direct trade with the various treaty ports, the progress of HongKong has been
                    steady, and there is every probability of its maintaining its peculiar position
                    of influence in the Chinese trade. In 1871 it was placed in telegraphic
                    communication with England, and in its recent legislative action it has shown
                    vitality and enterprise. The gambling practices which prevailed here, as they
                    still do in many Chinese towns, have been vigorously suppressed, and the
                    difficulties arising from the sudden development of the coolie emigration have
                    been overcome. The presence of Chinese revenue cruisers in Hong-Kong waters has
                    led (February 1880) to a storm of opposition on the part of resident British
                    merchants, who declare that this amounts to a blockade of the island; but
                    British officials uphold the action of China as a necessary check upon the opium
                    and salt smuggling.</p>
