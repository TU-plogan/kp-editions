                    surgeon to a regiment; and his knowledge of the native tongues and his capacity
                    for business threw open to him the lucrative offices of interpreter and

                    chemical knowledge enabled him to render a signal service to the administration
                    by making available a large quantity of gunpowder which damp had spoiled. In
                    1808, on the restoration of peace, he resigned all his civil appointments, and
                    returned home in the prime of life, and in the possession of a well-earned
                    fortune. His first care on arriving in England was to study thoroughly the
                    country and its resources, for which purpose he made various journeys, to see
                    the actual state of the people and the practical operation of the laws. In 1812
                    he took his seat for the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe-Regis; but he was soon
                    obliged to resign it, when it was discovered by his Tory patron that he had had
                    the audacity to talk of reform. Six years elapsed before he again entered the
                    House, and during that interval he had made the acquaintance and imbibed the
                    doctrines of James Mill and the philosophical reformers of the school of
                    Bentham. He had joined his efforts to those of Mr Place, of Westminister, and
                    other philanthropists, to relieve and improve the condition of the working
                    classes, labouring especially to establish schools for them on the Lancasterian
                    system, and promoting the formation of savings banks. In 1818, soon after his
                    marriage with Miss Burnley, the daughter of an East India director, he was
                    returned to parliament as member for the Aberdeen burghs. He was afterwards
                    successively elected for Middlesex (1830), Kilkenny (1837), and for the Montrose
                    burghs (1842), in the service of which constituency he died. From the date of
                    his re-entering the House Hume began, unaided and alone, that course of reform
                    in which he persevered to his death. He became the self-elected guardian of the
                    public purse, withstanding every abuse of the public money, by challenging and
                    bringing to a direct vote every single item of public expenditure. The
                    difficulties Hume encountered in the course of his efforts to reduce the
                    enormous burden of taxation under which the country groaned were aggravated by
                    the confused state of the public accounts. But no obstacle daunted or
                    discouraged him in his enlightened efforts as the pioneer of commercial,
                    financial, and parliamentary reform. Other labours with which his name is
                    connected deserve to be recorded. He unravelled the Orange Lodge conspiracy, the
                    ramifications of which spread over England, Scotland, and the colonies, and the
                    object of which was to make the duke of Cumberland king in place of William IV.
                    He carried on a successful warfare against the old combination laws that
                    hampered workmen and favoured masters; he brought about the repeal of the laws
                    prohibiting the export of machinery and of the Act preventing workmen from going
                    abroad. He constantly protested against flogging in the army, the impressment of
                    sailors, and imprisonment for debt. He took up the question of lighthouses and
                    harbours; in the former he secured greater efficiency, in the latter he
                    prevented useless expenditure. At first despised and ridiculed, afterwards
                    dreaded for his tenacity of purpose, he ended by gaining the respect of friends
                    and of foes, and the confidence of the whole nation. The breadth of his action,
                    his singleness of aim, his perfect independence of all party or personal
                    considerations, and an almost heroic earnestness and self-denial in carrying out
                    his views, were the secrets of his influence. Himself as incorruptible as
                    Aristides, he made it a special duty to hunt out and expose political corruption
                    under whatever guise it lurked, and the whole army of place-hunters and jobbers
                    found in him their most indefatigable and inexorable foe. There were many abler,
                    but there was no more useful member in the House during the greater portion of
                    his parliamentary career. He died February 20, 1855.</p>
