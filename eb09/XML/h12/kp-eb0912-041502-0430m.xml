                    juridical school of Breda. His mathematical bent, however, soon diverted him
                    from his legal studies, and the perusal of some of his earliest theorems enabled
                    Descartes to predict his future greatness. In 1649 he accompanied the mission of
                    Henry, count of Nassau, to Danmark, and in 1651 entered the lists of science as
                    an assailant of the unsound system of quadratures adopted by Gregory of St
                    Vincent. This first essay <hi rend="italic">(Exetasis quadratures</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">circuli,</hi> Layden, 1651) was quickly succeeded by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Theoremata</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quadratura</hi><hi rend="italic">hyperboles, ellipsis,</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    circuli,</hi> while, in a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">circuli magnitudine inventa,</hi> he made, three years later, the
                    closest approximation hitherto obtained to the ratio of the circumference to the
                    diameter of a circle.</p>
                <p>But another class of subjects was about to engage his attention. The improvement
                    of the telescope was then justly regarded as a <hi rend="italic">sine qua
                    non</hi> for the advancement of astronomical knowledge. Owing, however, to the
                    difficulties interposed by spherical and chromatic aberration, little progress
                    had been made in that direction when, in 1655, Huygens, working with his brother
                    Constantin, hit upon a new method of grinding and polishing lenses. The
                    immediate results of the clearer definition obtained were the detection of a
                    satellite to Saturn (the sixth in order of distance from its primary), and the
                    resolution into their true form of the abnormal appendages to that planet. Each
                    discovery in turn was, according to the prevailing custom, announced to the
                    learned world under the veil of an anagram—removed, in the case of the first, by
                    the publication, early in 1656, of the little tract <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Saturni luna observatio</hi><hi rend="italic">nova;</hi> but
                    retained, as regards the second, until 1659, when in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema Saturnium</hi> the varying appearances of the so-called “triple planet”
                    were clearly explained as the phases of a ring inclined at an angle of 20° to
                    the ecliptic. His application of the pendulum to regulate the movement of clocks
                    was another fruit of his astronomical labours, springing, as it did, from his
                    experience of the need for an exact measure of time in observing the heavens.
                    The invention dates from 1656; the <hi rend="italic">Horologium,</hi> containing
                    a description of the requisite mechanism, was published in the following year,
                    and on the 16th of June 1657 Huygens presented his first “pendulum-clock” to the
                    states-general.</p>
                <p>His reputation now became cosmopolitan. As early as 1655 the university of Angers
                    had distinguished him with an honorary degree of doctor of laws. In 1663, on the
                    occasion of his second visit to England, he was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society, and imparted to that body in January 1669 a clear and concise statement
                    of the laws governing the collision of elastic bodies. Although these
                    conclusions were arrived at independently, and, as it would seem, several years
                    previous to their publication, they were in great measure anticipated by the
                    communications on the same subject of Wallis and Wren, made respectively in
                    November and December 1668.</p>
                <p>Huygens had before this time fixed his abode in France. In 1665 Colbert made to
                    him on behalf of Louis XIV. an offer too tempting to be refused, and between the
                    following year and 1681 his residence in the philosophic seclusion of the
                    Bibliothèque du Roi was only interrupted by two short visits to his native
                    country. His <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> dates from this period. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Horologium Oscillatorium,</hi> published with a dedication to his
                    royal patron in 1673, contained origiml discoveries sufficient to have furnished
                    materials for half a dozen striking disquisitions. His solution of the
                    celebrated problem of the “centre of oscillation” formed in itself an important
                    event in the history of mechanics. Assuming as an axiom that the centre of
                    gravity of any number of interdependent bodies cannot rise higher than the point
                    from which it fell, he arrived, by anticipating in the particular case the
                    general principle of the conservation of <hi rend="italic">vis viva,</hi> at
                    correct although not strictly demonstrated conclusions. His treatment of the
                    subject is especially noteworthy as being the first successful attempt to deal
                    with the dynamics of a system. The determination of the true relation between
                    the length of a pendulum and the time of its oscillation; the invention of the
                    theory of evolutes; the discovery, hence ensuing, that the cycloid is its own
                    evolute, and is strictly isochronous; the ingenious although practically
                    inoperative idea of correcting the “circular .error” of the pendulum by applying
                    cycloidal cheeks to clocks— were all contained in this remarkable treatise. The
                    theorems on the composition of forces in circular motion with which it concluded
                    formed the true prelude to the <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> and would alone
                    suffice to establish the claim of Huygens to the highest rank among mechanical
                    inventors.</p>
                <p>In 1681 he finally severed his French connexions, and returned to Holland. The
                    harsher measures which about that time began to be adopted towards his
                    co-religionists in France are usually assigned as the motive of this step. He
                    now devoted himself during six years to the production of lenses of enormous
                    focal distance, which, mounted on high poles, and connected with the eye-piece
                    by means of a cord, formed what were called “aerial telescopes.” Three of his
                    object-glasses, of respectively 123, 180, and 210 feet focal length, are still
                    in the possession of the Royal Society. He also succeeded in constructing an
                    almost perfectly achromatic eye-piece, still known by his name. But his
                    researches in physical optics constitute his chief title-deed to immortality.
                    Although Hooke first proposed the wave theory of light, Huygens gave reality to
                    the conception, establishing it on a foundation so sure that it has never since
                    been shaken. His powerful scientific imagination enabled him to perceive that an
                    undulation may be broken up into an indefinite number of parts, each of which is
                    the origin of a partial wave, and that the aggregate effect of all these partial
                    waves will reconstitute the primary wave at any subsequent stage of its
                    progress. This resolution of the main undulation is the well-known “Principle of
                    Huygens,” and by its means he was enabled to prove the fundamental laws of
                    optics, and to assign the correct construction for the direction of the
                    extraordinary ray in uniaxial crystals. These investigations, together with his
                    discovery of the “wonderful phenomenon” of polarization, are recorded in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Traite de la Lumière,</hi> published at Leyden in 1690, but
                    composed in 1678. In the appended treatise <hi rend="italic">Sur la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cause</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Pesanteur,</hi> he rejected
                    gravitation as a universal quality of matter, although admitting the Newtonian
                    theory of the planetary revolutions. From his views on centrifugal force he
                    deduced the oblate figure of the earth, estimating its compression, however, at
                    little more than one-half its actual amount.</p>
                <p>Huygens was never married. He died at the Hague, June 8,1695, bequeathing his
                    manuscripts to the university of Leyden, and his considerable property to the
                    sons of his younger brother. In character he was as estimable as he was
                    brilliant in intellect. Although, like most men of strong originative power, he
                    assimilated with difficulty the ideas of others, his tardiness sprang rather
                    from inability to depart from the track of his own methods than from reluctance
                    to acknowledge the merits of his competitors.</p>
                <p>In addition to the works already mentioned, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cοsmοtheοrοs—</hi> a speculation concerning the inhabitants of the planets—was
                    printed posthumously at the Hague in 1698, and appeared almost simultaneously in
                    an English translation. A volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Opera Γosthuma,</hi>
                    Leyden, 1703, contained his “Dioptrica,” in which the ratio between the
                    respective focal lengths of object-glass and eye-glass is given as the measure
                    of magnifying power, together with the shorter essays <hi rend="italic"

                    the first formal treatises on the theory of probabilities; nor should his
                    investigations of the properties of the cissoid, logarithmic, and catenary be
                    left unnoticed. His invention of the spiral watch-spring was explained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants,</hi> February 25, 1675. An edition of his
                    works was published by ’S Gravesande, of which two quarto volumes appeared under
                    the heading <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">varia,</hi> Leyden,
