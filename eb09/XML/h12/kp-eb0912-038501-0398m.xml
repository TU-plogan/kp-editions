                    78, was descended from the old Ayrshire family of Hunter of Hunterston, and his
                    mother was the daughter of a Mr Paul, treasurer of Glasgow. Hunter is said to
                    have made but little progress at school, being averse to its restraints and
                    pursuits, and fond of country amusements. When seventeen years old he repaired
                    to Glasgow, where he for a short time assisted his brother-in law, Mr Buchanan,
                    a cabinetmaker, who had involved himself in pecuniary difficulties. Being
                    desirous at length of some settled occupation, he obtained from his brother
                    William permission to aid, under Mr Symonds, in making dissections in his
                    anatomical school, then the most celebrated in London, intending, should he be
                    unsuccessful there, to enter the army. He arrived accordingly in the metropolis
                    in September 1748, about a fortnight before the commencement of his brother’s
                    autumnal course of lectures. After succeeding beyond expectation with the
                    dissection of the muscles of an arm, he was entrusted with a similar part
                    injected, and from the excellence of his second essay Dr Hunter predicted that
                    he would become a good anatomist. Seemingly John Hunter had hitherto received no
                    instruction in preparation for the special course of life upon which he had
                    entered. His brother, with whom he was now intimately associated, was one of the
                    most brilliant exponents of medical science, and enjoyed the society of the best
                    cultured men of the age; but that it was through this circumstance that, as
                    stated by R. A. Stafford,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Hunt. Orat.,</hi> 1851, p. 6.</p></note> “he was taught to
                    think,” and that his mind, as has been surmised, had previous to his coming to
                    London been “idle, heedless, and aimless,” can hardly be concluded in the face
                    of what the future revealed of the practical and inquiring turn and the
                    originality of his mental disposition. Rather we may assume, with B. B.

                    powers of mind which rendered him to some extent independent of the training
                    required by less extraordinary intellects. Dr J. Ridge,<note anchored="true"

                    Hunter’s permitted truancy from the grammar school, argues that early tuition
                    and attainments, at least of the kind imparted, being inconsistent with a
                    natural education of the senses, are not favourable to the production of
                    extraordinary genius. Hunter’s power of estimating what was worth doing, and
                    what could be done, is by Dr Moxon<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    being “a man who had a free youth, not over-taught, nor over-strained;” and, if
                    it be true that “the early part of life, the school-time, has long been spent,
                    and is spent, in pursuits which minister but little to the culture of the mind,
                    or to the communication and reception of knowledge useful to any class of

                    served to protect Hunter from influences opposed to that very endowment which
                    made him preeminent as a teacher, namely, the power of perceiving the relation
                    of numerous individual facts as illustrations of general principles.</p>
                <p>Hard-working, and singularly patient and skilful in dissection, Hunter had by his
                    second winter in London acquired sufficient anatomical knowledge to be entrusted
                    with the charge of his brother’s practical class, with the members of which, as
                    also with the resurrection men, he was a universal favourite. In the summer
                    months of 1749-50, at Chelsea Military Hospital, he attended the lectures and
                    operations of Cheselden, on whose retirement in the following year he became a
                    surgeon’s pupil at St Bartholomew’s, where Pott was one of the senior surgeons.
                    In the summer of 1752 he visited Scotland. Home and, following him, Ottley state
                    that Hunter began in 1754 to assist his brother as his partner in lecturing;
                    according, however, to the <hi rend="italic">European Magazine</hi> for 1782,
                    the office of lecturer was offered to Hunter by his brother in 1758, but
                    declined by him on account of the “insuperable embarrass* ments and objections”
                    which he felt to speaking in public. In 1754 he became a surgeon’s pupil at St
                    George’s Hospital, where he was appointed house-surgeon in 1756.<note

                    in addition to other labours, solved the problem of the descent of the testis in
                    the foetus, traced the ramifications of the nasal and olfactory nerves within
                    the nose, experimentally tested the questionwhetherveins could act as
                    absorbents, studied the formation of pus, and the nature of the placental
                    circulation, and with his brother earned the chief merit of practically proving
                    the function and importance of the lymphatics in the animal economy. On June 5,

                    gives 1753 as the date. In the buttery book for 1755 at St Mary’s Hall his
                    admission is thus noted: “Die Junii 5 <hi rend="superscript"> to</hi> 1755
                    Admissus est Johannes Hunter superioris ordinis Commen-salis.” Hunter apparently
                    left Oxford after less than two months’ residence, as the last entry in the
                    buttery book with charges for battels against his name is on July 25, 1755. His
                    name was, however, retained on the books of the Hall till December 10, 1756. The
                    writer is indebted to Dr John Griffiths, Keeper of the Archives, Oxford
                    University, for the following record of Hunter’s matriculation :— “TerTrin.

                    induced to enter as a gentleman commoner at St Mary’s Hall, Oxford, but his true
                    instincts would not permit him, to use his own expression, “to stuff Latin and
                    Greek at the university.” Some three and thirty years later he thus
                    significantly wrote of an opponent:—“Jesse Foot accuses me of not understanding
                    the dead languages; but I could teach him that on the dead body which he never
                    knew in any language dead or living.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    correct in him what was perhaps a natural defect—a difficulty in the
                    presentation of abstract ideas which was not wholly attributable to the novelty
                    of his doctrines.</p>
                <p>An attack of inflammation of the lungs in the spring of 1759, apparently caused
                    by overwork, having produced symptoms threatening consumption, by which the
                    promising medical career of his brother James had been cut short, Hunter, with a
                    view to residence abroad for a season, obtained from Mr Adair in October 1760
                    the appointment of staff-surgeon in Hodgson and Keppel’s expedition to
                    Belleisle. With this he sailed in 1761. In the following year he served with the
                    English forces on the frontier of Portugal. Whilst with the army he acquired the
                    extensive knowledge of gunshot wounds embodied in his important treatise on that
                    subject, published in 1794, in which, amongst other matters of moment, he
                    insists on the rejection of the indiscriminate practice of dilating with the
                    knife followed almost universally by surgeons of his time. When not engaged in
                    the active duties of his profession, he occupied himself with physiological and
                    other scientific researches. Thus, in 1761, off Belleisle, the conditions of <pb

                    land, he continued the study of human anatomy, and arranged his notes and
                    memoranda on inflammation; he also ascertained by experiment that digestion does
                    not take place in snakes and lizards during hibernation, and observed that
                    enforced vigorous movement at that season proves fatal to such animals, the
                    waste so occasioned not being compensated, whence he drew the inference that, in
                    the diminution of the power of a part attendant on mortification, resort to
                    stimulants which increase action without giving real strength is
                    inadvisable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Adams,

                    and morbid structures.</p>
                <p>On arriving in England early in 1763, Hunter, having retired from the army on
                    half-pay, took a house in Golden Square, and commenced the career of a London
                    surgeon. Most of the metropolitan practice at the time was held by Pott, C.
                    Hawkins, Sharpe, Warner, Adair, and Tomkins; and Hunter sought to eke out his at
                    first slender income by teaching practical anatomy and operative surgery to a
                    private class. His leisure was devoted to the study of comparative anatomy, to
                    procure subjects for which he obtained the refusal of animals dying in the Tower
                    menagerie and in various travelling zoological collections. In connexion with

                    lectures, p. 437, the accident was “after dancing, and after a violent fit of
                    the cramp;” Clift, however, who says he probably never danced, believed that he
                    met with the accident “in getting up from the dissecting table after being
                    cramped by long sitting” (see W. Lawrence, <hi rend="italic">Hunt. Orat.,</hi>

                    which, with the illustrations in his museum of the reunion of such structures
                    after division, laid the foundation of the modern practice of cutting through
                    tendons for the relief of distorted and contracted joints. In the same year he
                    was made a fellow of the Royal Society. His first contribution to the· <hi

                    and read June 18, 1772, in which he first correctly explained that phenomenon as

                    these may be included a paper by Home, from materials supplied by Hunter, on
                    certain horny excrescences of the human body.</p></note> Hunter, on December 9,
                    1768, was elected a surgeon to St George’s Hospital, and, soon after, a member
                    of the Corporation of Surgeons. He now began to take house-pupils. Among these
                    were Edward Jenner, who came to him in 1770, and until the time of Hunter’s
                    death corresponded with him on the most intimate and affectionate terms, W. Guy,
                    Kingston, Dr Physick of Philadelphia, and Everard Home, his brother-in-law. Mr
                    Lynn and Sir A. Carlisle, though not inmates of his house, were frequent
                    visitors there. His pupils at</p>
                <p>St George’s included Abernethy, Cline, James Earle, and Astley Cooper. From the
                    high reputation in their profession which these one and all attained, some
                    estimate may be formed of the weight and value of Hunter’s personal influence
                    and teaching. In 1770 he settled in Jermyn Street, in the house which his
                    brother William had previously occupied; and in July 1771 he married Anne, the
                    eldest daughter of Mr Robert Home, surgeon to Burgoyne’s regiment of
                    light-horse.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Earl’s Court, Brompton, where most of his biological researches were carried on.
                    There he kept for the purpose of study and experiment the fishes, lizards,
                    blackbirds, hedgehogs, and other animals sent him from time to time by Jenner,
                    tame pheasants and partridges, at least one eagle, toads, silkworms, * and many
                    more creatures obtained from every quarter of the globe. Bees he had under
                    observation in his conservatory for upwards of twenty years; hornets and wasps
                    were also diligently studied by him. On two occasions his life was in risk from
                    his pets—once in wrestling with a young bull, and again when he fearlessly took
                    back to their dens two leopards which had broken loose among his dogs. Choosing
                    intuitively the only true method of philosophical discovery, Hunter, ever
                    cautious of confounding fact and hypothesis, besought of nature the truth
                    through the medium of manifold experiments and observations. “He had never read
                    Bacon,” says Babington, “but his mode of studying nature was as strictly
                    Baconian as if he had.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    never mind her. I shall employ you with hedgehogs, for I do not know how far I

                    conducted so many physiological and pathological investigations in the animal
                    world as Hunter; and yet it was with him an axiom “that experiments should not
                    be often repeated which tend merely to establish a principle already known and
                    admitted, but that the next step should be the application of that principle to
                    useful purposes” (“Anim. Oecon.,” <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> iv. 86). During
                    fifteen years he kept a flock of geese simply in order to acquaint himself with
                    the development of birds in eggs, with reference to which he remarked—“It would
                    almost appear that this mode of propagation was intended for investigation.” In

                    the relation of strength of constitution to sex. He exchanged the spurs of a
                    young cock and a young pullet, and found that on the former the transplanted
                    structure grew to a fair size, on the latter but little; whereas a spur from one
                    leg of a cock transferred to its comb, a part well supplied with blood, grew
                    more than twice as fast as that left on the other leg. Another experiment of
                    his, which required many trials for success, was the engrafting of a human
                    incisor on the comb of a cock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    illustrated by Hunter’s observation that in a sea-gull which he had brought to

                <p>It was in 1772 that Hunter, in order effectually to gauge the extent of his own
                    knowledge, and also to correctly express his views, which had been repeatedly
                    misstated or ascribed to others, commenced his lectures on the theory and
                    practice of surgery, at first delivered free to his pupils and a few friends,
                    but subsequent to 1774 on the usual terms, four guineas. Though Pott, indeed,
                    had perceived that the only true system of surgery is that which most closely
                    accords with the curative efforts of nature, a rational pathology can hardly be
                    said to have had at this time any existence; and it was generally assumed that a
                    knowledge of anatomy alone was a sufficient foundation for the study of surgery.
                    Hunter, unlike his contemporaries, to most of whom his philosophic habit of
                    thought was a mystery, and whose books contained little else than relations of
                    cases, and modes of treatment, sought the reason for each phenomenon that came
                    under his notice. The principles of surgery, he maintained, are not less
                    necessary to be understood than the principles of other sciences; unless,
                    indeed, the surgeon should wish to resemble “the Chinese philosopher whose
                    knowledge consisted only in facts.” In that case the science must remain
                    unimproved until fresh facts arise. Too much attention, he remarked, cannot be
                    paid to facts; yet a multitude of facts overcrowd the memory without advantage
                    if they do not lead us to establish principles, by an acquaintance with which we
                    learn the causes of diseases. Hunter’s course, which latterly comprised
                    eighty-six lectures, delivered on alternate evenings between the hours of seven
                    and eight, lasted from October to April. Some teachers of his time were content
                    to dismiss the subjects of anatomy and surgery in a course of only six weeks’
                    duration. The task of lecturing is said to have been to Hunter so formidable
                    that at the commencement of each course he was obliged to take half a drachm of
                    laudanum. His class was usually small, and never exceeded thirty. Among its
                    members at various times were Abernethy, Carlisle, Chevalier, Cline, Coleman,
                    Astley Cooper, Home, Lynn, and Macartney. Hunter was deficient in the gifts of a
                    good extempore speaker, being in this respect a remarkable contrast to his
                    brother William; and he read his lectures, seldom raising his eyes from the
                    manuscript. His manner with his auditory is stated to have been embarrassed and
                    awkward, or, as Adams puts it <hi rend="italic">(Obs. on Morbid Pois.,</hi> p.
                    272), “frequently ungraceful,” and his language always unadorned; but that his
                    “expressions for the explaining of his new theories rendered his lectures often
                    unintelligible” is scarcely evident in his pupils’ notes still extant. His own
                    and others’ errors and fallacies were exposed with equal freedom in his
                    teaching. Occasionally he would tell his pupils, “You had better not write down
                    that observation, for very likely I shall think differently next year;” and once
                    to a question of Coleman’s he replied, “Never ask me what I have said or what I
                    have written; but, if you will ask me what my present opinions are, I will tell
                    you.” He was always much gratified when, in the conversations that he encouraged
                    his hearers to hold with him at the end of his lectures, he found that what he
                    said was understood and appreciated.</p>
                <p>In January 1776 Hunter was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the king. He
                    commenced in the same year hia Croonian lectures on muscular motion, continued
                    annually, except in 1777, till 1782: they were never published by him, being in
                    his opinion too incomplete. In 1778 appeared the second part of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on the Natural History of the Human Teeth,</hi> the first
                    part of which was published in 1771. It was in the waste of the dental alveoli
                    and of the fangs of shedding teeth that in 1754-55, as he tells us, he received
                    his first hint of the use of the absorbents. Abernethy <hi rend="italic">{Phys.
                    Lect.,</hi> p. 196) relates that Hunter, being once asked how he could suppose
                    it possible for absorbents to do such things as he attributed to them, replied,
                    “Nay, I know not, unless they possess powers similar to those which a
                    caterpillar exerts when feeding on a leaf.” Hunter in 1780 read before the Royal
                    Society a paper in which he laid claim to have been the first to make out the
                    nature of the utero-placental circulation. His brother William, who had five
                    years previously described the same in his <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of the
                    Gravid Uterus,</hi> thereupon wrote to the Society attributing to himself this
                    honour. John Hunter in a rejoinder to his brother’s letter, dated February 17,
                    1780, reiterated his former statement, viz., that his discovery, on the evening
                    of the day in 1754 that he had made it in a specimen injected by a Dr Mackenzie,
                    had been communicated by him to Dr Hunter. Thus arose an estrangement between
                    the two Hunters, which continued until the time of William’s last illness, when
                    his brother obtained permission to visit him.</p>
                <p>In 1783 Hunter was elected a member of the Royal Society of Medicine and of the
                    Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris, and took part in the formation of “A Society
                    for the Improvement of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge.”<note anchored="true"

                    (1790), and a case of poisoning during pregnancy (1794), with others written by
                    Home, from materials supplied by him, on Hunter’s operation for the cure of
                    popliteal aneurism, on loose cartilages in joints, on certain horny excrescences
                    of the human body, and on the growth of bones.</p></note> It appears from a
                    letter by Hunter that in the latter part of 1783 he, with Jenner, had the
                    subject of colour-blindness under consideration. As in that year the lease of
                    his premises in Jermyn Street was to expire, he purchased the twenty-four years’
                    leasehold of two houses, the one on the east side of Leicester Square, the other
                    in Castle Street, with intervening ground. Between the houses he built in
                    1783-85, at an expense of above £3000, a museum for his anatomical and other
                    collections. These by 1782 had cost him £10,000, and contained preparations of
                    numerous specimens presented by Sir Joseph Banks, the Honourable C. Greville,
                    and Mr Walsh. The new edifice consisted of a hall 52 feet long by 28 feet wide,
                    and lighted from the top, with a gallery all round, and having beneath it a
                    lecture <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n401/mode/1up"

                    meetings of the Lycaeum Medicum, a society instituted by Hunter and Fordyce. In
                    April 1785 Hunter’s collections were removed into it under the superintendence
                    of Home and Bell,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bell

                    preparations for the museum. He died in 1792 at Sumatra, where he was
                    assistant-surgeon to the East India Company.</p></note> and another assistant,
                    André. Among the foreigners of distinction that inspected the museum, which was
                    now shown by Hunter twice a year,—in October to medical men, and in May to other
                    visitors,—were Blumenbach, Camper, Poli, and Scarpa. In the acquisition of
                    subjects for his varied biological investigations and of specimens for his
                    museum, expense was a matter of small moment with Hunter. Thus at one time he
                    endeavoured, at his own cost, to obtain information respecting the Cetacea by
                    sending out a surgeon to the North in a Greenland whaler. He is said, moreover,
                    to have given, in June 1783, no less than .£500 for the body of O’Brien, or
                    Byrne, the Irish giant, whose skeleton, 7 feet 7 inches high, is so conspicuous
                    an object in the museum of the College of Surgeons of London.<note

                    by Hunter, had shortly before his death arranged with several of his countrymen
                    that his corpse should be conveyed by them to the sea, and sunk in deep water;
                    but his undertaker, who had entered into a pecuniary compact with the great
                    anatomist, managed that while the escort was drinking at a certain stage on the
                    march seawards, the coffin should be locked up in a bam. There some men he had
                    concealed speedily substituted an equivalent weight of paving-stones for the
                    body, which was at night forwarded to Hunter, and by him taken in his carriage
                    to Earl’s Court, and, to avoid risk of a discovery, immediately after suitable
                    division boiled to obtain the bones. See Tom Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Leicester

                    resting his somewhat upraised head on his left hand, fell into a profound
                    reverie—one of those waking dreams, seemingly, which in his lectures he has so
                    well described, when “the body loses the consciousness of its own

                <p>Among the subjects of Hunter’s physiological investigations in 1785 was the mode
                    of growth of deer’s antlers. As he possessed the privilege of making experiments
                    on the deer in Richmond Park, he in July of that year had a buck there caught
                    and thrown, and tied one of its external carotid arteries. He observed that the
                    antler which obtained its blood supply therefrom, then half-grown, became in
                    consequence cold to the touch. Hunter debated with himself whether it would be
                    shed in due time, or be longer retained than ordinarily. To his surprise he
                    found, on re-examining the antler a week or two later, when the wound around the
                    ligatured artery was healed, that it had regained its warmth, and was still
                    increasing in size. Had, then, his operation been in some way defective? To
                    determine this question, the buck was killed and sent to Leicester Fields. On
                    examination Hunter ascertained that the external carotid had been duly tied, but
                    that certain small branches of the artery above and below the ligature had
                    enlarged, and by their anastomoses had restored the blood supply of the growing
                    part. Thus it was evident that under “the stimulus of necessity,” to use a
                    phrase of the experimenter, the smaller arterial channels are capable of rapid
                    increase in dimensions to perform the offices of the larger.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on the Blood,</hi> p. 288, Hunter observes :—“We find it a common
                    principle in the animal machine, that every part increases in some degree
                    according to the action required. Thus we find .... vessels become larger in
                    proportion to the necessity of supply, as for instance, in the gravid uterus;
                    the external carotids in the stag, also, when his horns are growing, are much
                    larger than at any other time.”</p></note> It happened that, in the ensuing
                    December, there lay in one of the wards of St George’s Hospital a patient of
                    Hunter’s, admitted for popliteal aneurism. The disease must soon prove fatal
                    unless by some means arrested. Should the surgeon, following the usual and
                    commonly fatal method of treatment, cut down upon the tumour, and, after tying
                    the artery above and below it, evacuate its contents? Or should he adopt the
                    procedure, deemed by Pott generally advisable, of amputating the limb above it
                    <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi rend="italic">It</hi> was Hunter’s aim in his
                    practice, even if he could not dispense with the necessity, at least to diminish
                    the severity of operations, which he considered were an acknowledgment of the
                    imperfection of the art of healing, and compared to “the acts of the armed
                    savage, who attempts to get that by force which a civilized man would get by
                    stratagem.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Since, he argued, the experiment with
                    the buck had shown that collateral vessels are capable of continuing the
                    circulation when passage through a main trunk is arrested, why should he not, in
                    his aneurism case, leaving the absorbents to deal with the contents of the
                    tumour, tie the artery in the sound parts, where it is tied in amputation, and
                    preserve the limb? Acting upon this idea, he ligatured his patient’s femoral
                    artery in the lower part of its course in the thigh, in the fibrous sheath
                    enclosing the space since known as “Hunter’s canal.”<note anchored="true"

                    first time did not include the vein in the ligature. His patient lived for fifty
                    years afterwards. The results on the artery of this operation are to be seen in

                    in Hunter’s second case on the day after the operation; andin his fourth case it
                    reached 4-5° on the first day, and continued during a fortnight.</p></note> At
                    the end of January 1786, that is, in six weeks’ time, the patient was well
                    enough to be able to leave the hospital. Thus it was that Hunter inaugurated an
                    operation which has been the means of preserving to hundreds life with integrity
                    of limb — an operation which, as the Italian Assalini, who saw it first
                    performed, testifies, “excited the greatest wonder, <pb break="no"

                    Europe.”</p>
                <p>Early in 1786 Hunter published his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Venereal
                    Disease,</hi> which, like some of his previous writings, was printed in his own
                    house. Without the aid of the booksellers, 1000 copies of it were sold within a
                    twelvemonth. Although certain views therein expressed with regard to the
                    relationship of syphilis have been proved erroneous, the work is a valuable
                    compendium of observations of cases and modes of treatment (c∕. Hilton, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hunt. Orat.,</hi> p. 40). Towards the end of the year appeared his
                    <hi rend="italic">Observations on certain parts of the Animal (Economy,</hi>
                    which, besides the more important of his contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> contains nine papers on various subjects. By
                    the death of Mr Middleton in 1786, Hunter became deputy surgeon-general to the
                    army; his appointment as surgeon-general and as inspector-general of hospitals
                    followed in 1790, on the death of Mr Adair. In 1787 he received the Royal
                    Society’s Copley medal as a testimony to the importance of his discoveries in
                    natural history,and was also elected a member of the American Philosophical
                    Society. On account of the increase in his practice and his impaired health, he
                    now obtained the services of Home as his assistant at St George’s Hospital. The
                    death of Pott in December 1788 secured to Hunter the undisputed title of the
                    first surgeon in England. He resigned to Home, in 1792, the delivery of his
                    surgical lectures, in order to devote himself more fully to the completion of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Blood, Inflammation, and Gunshot
                    Wounds,</hi> which was published by his executors in 1794. In this, his
                    masterpiece, the application of physiology to practice is especially noticeable.
                    Certain experiments described in the first part, pp. 62-64, which demonstrate
                    that arterialization of the blood in respiration takes place by a process of
                    diffusion of “pure air” or “vital air” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> f</hi> oxygen) through membrane, were made so early as
                    the summer of 1755.</p>
                <p>Hunter in 1792 announced to his colleagues at St George’s, who, he considered,
                    neglected the proper instruction of the students under their charge, his
                    intention no longer to divide with them the fees which he received for his
                    hospital pupils. Against this innovation, however, the governors of the hospital
                    decided in March 1793. Subsequently, by a committee of their appointing, a code
                    of rules respecting pupils was promulgated, one clause of which, probably
                    directed against an occasional practice of Hunter’s, stipulated that no person
                    should be admitted as a student of the hospital without certificates that he had
                    been educated for the medical profession. In the autumn two young Scotchmen,
                    ignorant of the new rule, came up to town and applied to Hunter for admission as
                    his pupils at St George’s. Hunter explained to them how he was situated, but
                    promised to advance their request at the next board meeting at the hospital on
                    the 16th October. On that day, having finished a difficult piece of dissection,
                    he went down to breakfast in excellent spirits and in his usual health. After
                    making a professional call, he attended the board meeting. There the
                    interruption of his remarks in behalf of his applicants by a flat contradiction
                    from a colleague brought on one of the old spasmodic heart attacks; he ceased
                    speaking, and retired into an adjoining room only in time to fall lifeless into
                    the arms of Dr Robertson, one of the hospital physicians. After an hour had been
                    spent in vain attempts to restore animation, his body was conveyed to his house
                    in a sedan chair.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    record of Hunter’s death in the <hi rend="italic">St James Chronicle</hi> for
                    October 15-17, 1793, p. 4, col. 4, makes no allusion to the immediate cause of
                    Hunter’s death, but gives the following statement :— <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                    Hunter.</hi> —This eminent Surgeon and valuable man was suddenly taken ill,
                    yesterday, in the Council-room of St George’s Hospital. After receiving the
                    assistance which could be afforded by two Physicians and a Surgeon, he was
                    removed in a close chair to his house, in Leicester Fields, where he expired
                    about two o’clock.” Examination of the heart revealed disease involving the
                    pericardium, endocardium, and arteries, the coronary arteries in particular
                    showing ossifie change.</p></note> Thus, in his sixty-fifth year, and in the
                    height of his mental activity, died John Hunter, “whose range of thought nature
                    alone could fill,” and to whom, as to but few among all mankind, had been given
                    wisdom to interpret the dark sayings of nature. His remains were interred
                    privately on October 22, 1793, in the vaults of St Martin’s in the Fields.
                    Thence, on March 28, 1859, through the instrumentality of Mr Frank Buckland,
                    they were removed to Abbot Islip’s chapel in Westminster Abbey, to be finally
                    deposited in the grave in the north aisle of the nave, close to the
                    resting-place of Ben Jonson.</p>
                <p>Hunter was of about medium height, strongly built, and highshouldered and
                    short-necked. He had an open countenance, and large features, eyes light-blue or
                    grey, eyebrows prominent, and hair reddish-yellow in youth, later white, and
                    worn curled behind; and he dressed plainly and neatly. He rose at or before six,
                    dissected till nine (his breakfast hour), received, patients from halfpast nine
                    till twelve, at least during the latter part of his life, and saw his outdoor
                    and hospital patients till about four, when he dined, taking, according to Home,
                    as at other meals in the twenty years preceding his death, no wine. After dinner
                    he slept an hour; he then superintended experiments, read or prepared his
                    lectures, and made, usually by means of an amanuensis, records of the day’s
                    dissections. “I never could understand,” says Clift, “how Mr Hunter obtained
                    rest: when 1 left him at midnight, it was with a lamp fresh trimmed for further
                    study, and with the usual appointment to meet him again at six in the morning.”
                    Mr H. Leigh Thomas records<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Hunt. Orat.,</hi> 1827, p. 5.</p></note> that, on his
                    first arrival in London, having by desire called on Hunter at five o’clock in
                    the morning, he found him already busily engaged in the dissection of insects.
                    Rigidly economical of time, Hunter was always at work, and always he had in view
                    some fresh enterprise. He was once heard by Adams to express regret that men
                    must die at all. To his museum he gave a very large share of his attention,
                    being fearful lest the ordering of it should be incomplete at his death, and
                    knowing of none who could continue his work for him. “When I am dead,” said he
                    one day to Dr Garthshore, “you will not soon meet with another John Hunter.” At
                    the time of his death he had anatomized certainly over 500 different species of
                    animals, some of them repeatedly, and had made numerous dissections of plants.
                    The manuscript works by him appropriated and destroyed by Home, among which were
                    his eighty-six surgical lectures, all in full, are stated to have been
                    “literally a cartload”; and many pages of his records were written by Clift
                    under his directions ‘ ‘ at least half a dozen times over, with corrections and
                    transpositions almost without end.”</p>
                <p>To Hunter, as he himself observed, to think was a delight. His mind was framed
                    for systematic investigation, and hence, perhaps, arose the fatigue which, more
                    particularly during the last ten years of his life, the desultory conversation
                    of a mixed company would occasion him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Home, <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> p. lxv.</p></note> “My
                    mind is like a bee-hive,” was a remark of his to Abernethy, “a simile which
                    struck me,” says that writer, “on account of its correctness; for, in the midst
                    of buzz and apparent confusion, there was great order, regularity of structure,
                    and abundant food, collected with incessant industry from the choicest stores of
                    nature.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Hunt. Orat.,</hi> 1819, p. 48.</p></note>- Hunter was generally,
                    though cheerfully, taciturn, and many a morning’s labour with Clift was passed
                    with scarcely a word of discourse. When, however, he spoke—as while resting
                    himself, and standing upright from his dissection after stooping for hours as if
                    nailed to the object under investigation—he evinced both shrewdness and wit. In
                    conversation his words were well chosen, and his remarks often wonderfully
                    forcible and pointed; and, when so disposed, he could put things in a very
                    ludicrous point of view. He articulatèd slowly, and in consultation gave his
                    opinion much as if lecturing, the enunciation of his not seldom novel doctrines
                    being prefaced by some introductory illustration or history. A stranger to
                    artifice and flattery, and open and unceremonious or even blunt in speech, he
                    readily communicated what he knew and thought, and thus did not always inspire
                    others with a higher opinion of their personal consequence. “We are but
                    beginning to learn our profession,” he would tell his friends; and he was wont
                    to say that he was conscious of no peculiar talent, but that, if he had promoted
                    professional knowledge, it seemed to him to have arisen chiefly from his
                    disposition to distrust opinions, and to examine every subject for himself. What
                    views of his he confidently offered for acceptance were such as he believed to
                    have a solid foundation in facts; and the blind enunciation by his
                    fellow-practitioners of time-honoured errors vexed <pb break="no"

                    was rendered the mare so by excess of exertion, with repeatedly the additional
                    strain of bodily disease. “I know, I know,” said he to Abernethy, “I am but a
                    pigmy in knowledge, yet I feel as a giant when compared with these men.” The
                    charges that his language was frequently coarse, and that swearing was with him
                    a habit, as with many of his contemporaries and successors, have been
                    indignantly rebutted by Clift.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    morning interview with Hunter as “a mingled feeling of profound respect,
                    surprise, and admiration;” and by his assistants, pupils, and all with whom he
                    had lived on intimate terms, he was both loved and venerated. His temper, Home
                    states, was very warm and impatient, and when irritated not easily soothed. The
                    hasty but not altogether illogical outburst of his anger when refused the
                    postmortem examination of a child, the victim of some obscure malady, in the
                    words, “Then, sir, I heartily hope that yourself and all your family, nay all
                    your friends, may die of the same disease, and that no one may be able to afford
                    any assistance,” is in amusing contrast with the acknowledged benevolence of his
                    character. To the kindness of his disposition, his fondness for animals, his
                    aversion to operations, his thoughtful and self-sacrificing attention to his
                    patients, and especially his zeal to help forward struggling practitioners and
                    others in any want abundantly testify. “Every man,” said he, “should be an
                    economist, for if he has ever more money than his wants require he can assist
                    the poor.” In a letter of his, introducing a patient to his brother William, we
                    read: ‘ ‘ He has no money, and you have plenty, so that you are well met.”
                    Pecuniary means he valued no further than they enabled him to promote his
                    researches; and to the poor, to non-beneficed clergymen, professional authors,
                    and artists his services were rendered without remuneration. His yearly income
                    in 1763-74 was never £1000; it exceeded that sum in 1778, for several years
                    before his death was £5000, and at the time of that event had reached above
                    £6000. All his earnings not required for domestic expenses were, during the last
                    ten years of his life, devoted to the improvement of his museum; and his
                    property, this excepted, was found on his decease to be barely sufficient to pay
                    his debts. By his contemporaries generally Hunter was respected as a master of
                    the art and science of anatomy, and as a cautious and trustworthy if not an
                    elegant or very dexterous operator. Few, however, perceived the drift of his
                    biological researches. Although it was admitted, even by Foot,<note

                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Life of John Hunter,</hi> 1794.</p></note> that the
                    idea after which his unique museum had been formed—namely, that of morphology as
                    the only true basis of a systematic zoological classification—was entirely his
                    own, yet his investigations into the structure of the lower orders of animals
                    were regarded as, after all, works of unprofitable curiosity. One surgeon, of no
                    inconsiderable repute, is said to have ventured the remark that Mr Hunter’s
                    preparations were “just as valuable as so. many pig’s pettitoes;”<note

                    president of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, writing in 1796, plainly
                    expressed his disbelief as to the collection being ‘ ‘ an object of importance
                    to the general study of natural history, or indeed to any branch of science
                    except to that of medicine.” It was “without the solace of sympathy or
                    encouragement of approbation, without collateral assistance,”<note

                    fame—for he held that “no man ever was a great man who wanted to be one ”—that
                    Hunter laboured to perfect his designs, and established the science of
                    comparative anatomy, and principles which, however neglected in his life-time,
                    became the ground-work of all medical study and teaching.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the directions given by Hunter in his will, his collection was
                    offered for purchase to the British Government. But the prime minister, Mr Pitt,
                    on being asked to consider the matter, exclaimed: “What! buy preparations! Why,
                    I have not money enough to purchase gunpowder.” He, however, consented to the
                    bestowal of a portion of the king’s bounty for a couple of years on Mrs Hunter
                    and her two surviving children. In 1796 Lord Auckland undertook to urge upon the
                    Government the advisability of acquiring the collection, and on June 13, 1799,
                    parliament voted £15,000 for this purpose. Its custodianship, after refusal by
                    the College of Physicians, was unanimously accepted by the Corporation of
                    Surgeons on the terms proposed. These were in brief—that the collection be open
                    four hours in the forenoon, two days every week, for the inspection and
                    consultation of the fellows of the College of Physicians, the members of the
                    Company of Surgeons, and persons properly introduced by them, a catalogue of the
                    preparations and an official to explain it being at those times always at hand;
                    that a course of not less than twenty-four lectures<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Instituted in 1806.</p></note> on comparative
                    anatomy and other subjects illustrated by the collection be given every year by
                    some member of the Company; and that the preparations be kept in good
                    preservation at the expense of the Corporation, and be subject to the
                    superintendence of a board of sixteen trustees.<note anchored="true"

                    animals, whereas the red corpuscles are r.ot, we must suppose the lymph to be
                    the essential part of that fluid. Hunter was the first to discover that the
                    blood of the embryos of red-blooded animals is at first colourless, resembling
                    that of invertebrates. (Sec Owen, Preface to vol. iv. of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Works,</hi> p. xiii-)</p></note> The fulfilment of these conditions was
                    rendered possible by the receipt of fees forexaminations and diplomas, under the
                    charter by which, in 1800, the Corporation was constituted the Royal College of
                    Surgeons. A board of curators was in that year appointed by the council of the
                    college to provide for the management of the museum and the preparation of
                    catalogues. In 1806 the collection was placed in temporary quarters in Lincoln’s
                    Inn Fields, and the sum of £15,000 was voted by parliament for the erection of a
                    proper and commodious building for its preservation and extension. This was
                    followed by a grant of £12,500 in 1807. The collection was removed in 1812 to
                    the new museum, and opened to visitors in 1813. The greater part of the present
                    edifice was built in 1835, at an expense to the college of about £40,000; and
                    the combined Hunterian and collegiate collections, having been rearranged in
                    what are now termed the western and middle museums, were in 1836 made accessible
                    to the public. The erection of the eastern museum in 1852, on premises in
                    Portugal Street bought in 1847 for £16,000, cost £25,000, of which parliament
                    granted £15,000; it was opened in 1855.</p>
                <p>Hunter’s collection was estimated to contain 13,682 specimens, viz., in the
                    physiological department, 3745 in spirit, 965 osteological, 617 dry, 1968
                    zoological—total 7295; and in the pathological, 1084 in spirit, 625 dry
                    (including bones), 536 calculi and concretions, 218 monsters and. malformations,
                    and 215 microscopic —total 2678; and 3709 fossils. Since its acquisition by the
                    college, it has been greatly increased, notably by presentations from Sir
                    William Blizard (1811) and Sir S. L. Hammick (1851), and by purchase of
                    specimens in the possession of Sir A. Lever (1806), Messrs Joshua Brookes
                    (1828), Heaviside (1829), Langstaff, South (1835), Howship, Taunton (1841),
                    Liston (1842), and Walker (1843), Sir Astley Cooper (1843), and Dr Barnard Davis
                    (Jan. 1880). The histological collection, of which the 215 Hunterian specimens
                    are the nucleus, is the result chiefly of the labours of Professor Quekett, and
                    purchases from Dr Tweedy Todd, Mr Nasmyth, and Professor Lenhossek, and
                    contained in July 1880 upwards of 12,000 specimens. The library, the formation
                    of which commenced in 1801, consisted in July 1880 of 37,668 vols., comprising
                    14,882 separate works, and 39,021 tracts, pamphlets, essays, theses, and
                    reports. <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> Mr William Clift, whom, on February 14,
                    1792, Hunter received into his house to train as an assistant in his museum, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 8</hi> had the exclusive charge of the collection from the
                    date of its owner’s death to that of its purchase by the state. During this
                    period, with two gallons of spirit meted out occasionally, and the pittance of
                    7s. a week for his own support out of the limited funds at the disposal of
                    Hunter’s executors, he contrived to maintain the whole in good condition. He was
                    conservator of the museum, as stated on the pedestal of his bust there, from
                    1800 to 1849. From 1825 to 1832 he was assisted by his son, William Home Clift.
                    Professor Richard Owen held the office of assistant-conservator in 1832-35, and
                    of conservator in 1836-55, and Professor J. T. Quekett that of
                    assistantconservator in 1843-51, and of conservator from 1852 till his death in
                    1861, when he was succeeded by Professor William Henry Flower.</p>
                <p>The scope of Hunter’s labours may be defined as the explication of the various
                    phases of life exhibited in organized structures, both animal and vegetable,
                    from the simplest to the most highly differentiated. By him, therefore,
                    comparative anatomy was employed, not in subservience to the classification of
                    living forms, as by Cuvier, but as a means of gaining insight into the principle
                    animating and producing these forms, by virtue of which he perceived that,
                    however different in form and faculty, they were all allied to himself. In what
                    does life consist? is a question which in his writings he frequently considers,
                    and which seems to have been ever present in his mind. Life, he taught, was a
                    principle independent of structure, <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> most
                    tenaciously held by the least highly organized beings, but capable of readier
                    destruction as a whole, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by deprivation of heat
                    or by pain, in young than in old animals. In life he beheld an agency working
                    under the control of law, and exercising its functions in various modes and
                    degrees. He perceived it, as Abernethy observes, to be “a great chemist,” a
                    power capable of manufacturing a variety of substances into one kind of
                    generally distributed nutriment, and of furnishing from this a still greater
                    variety of dissimilar substances. Like Harvey, who terms it the <hi
                    rend="italic">anima vegetiva,</hi> he regarded it as a principle of
                    self-preservation, which keeps the body from dissolution. Life is shown, said
                    he, in renovation and action; but, although facilitated in its working by
                    mechanical causes, it can exist without action, as in an egg new-laid or
                    undergoing incubation. It is not simply a regulator of temperature; it is a
                    principle which resists cold, conferring on the structures which it endows the
                    capacity of passing· some degrees below the freezing-point of ordinary inanimate
                    matter without suffering congelation. Hunter found, in short, that there exists
                    in animals a latent heat of life, set free in the process of death (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n404/mode/1up"

                    observed that sap if removed from trees froze at 32° Fahr., but within them
                    might be fluid even at 15°; that a living snail placed in a freezing mixture
                    acquired first a temperature of 28°, and afterwards of 32° ere it froze; and
                    that, whereas a dead egg congealed immediately at 32°, a living egg did so only
                    when its temperature had risen to that point after a previous fall to 29∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. The-idea that the fluid and semifluid as well as the
                    solid constituents of the body contain the vital principle diffused through them
                    he formed in 1755-6, when, in making drawings illustrative of the changes that
                    take place in the incubated <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> he noted specially that
                    neither the white nor the yolk undergoes putrefaction. The blood he, with
                    Harvey, considered to possess a vitality of its own, more or less independent of
                    that of the animal in which it circulates. Life, he held, is preserved by the
                    compound of the living body and the source of its solid constituents, the living
                    blood. It is to the susceptibility of the latter to be converted into living
                    organized tissue that the union of severed structures by the first intention is
                    due. He even inclined to the belief that the chyle has life, and he considered
                    that food becomes ‘ ‘ animalized” in digestion. Coagulation of the blood he
                    compared to the contraction of muscles, and believed to be an operation of life
                    distinct from chemical coagulation, adducing in support of his opinion the fact
                    that, in animals killed by lightning, by violent blows on the stomach, or by the
                    exhaustion of hunting, it does not take place. “Breathing,” said Hunter, “seems
                    to render life to the blood, and the blood continues it in every part of the
                    body.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>TPeafwe <hi
                    rend="italic">on the Blood,</hi> p. 63.</p></note> Life, he held, could be
                    regarded as a fire, or something similar, and might for distinction’s sake be
                    called “animal fire.” Of this the process of respiration might afford a constant
                    supply, the fixed life supplied to the body in the food being set free and
                    rendered active in the lungs, whilst the air carried off that principle which
                    encloses and retains the animal fire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Essays and Observations,</hi> i.
                    ∏3.</p></note> The living principle, said Hunter, is coeval with the existence
                    of animal or vegetable matter itself, and may long exist without sensation. The
                    principle upon which depends the power of sensation regulates all our external
                    actions, as the principle of life does our internal, and the two act mutually on
                    each other in consequence of changes produced in the brain. Something (the
                    “materia vitae diflusa”) similar to the components of the brain (the “materia
                    vitae coacervata”) maybe supposed to-be diffused through the body and even
                    contained in the blood; between these a communication is kept up by the nerves
                    (the “chordae internunciae ”).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    89.</p></note> Neither a material nor a chemical theory of life, however, formed
                    a part of Hunter’s creed. “Mere composition of matter,” he remarked, “does not
                    give life; for the dead body has all the composition it ever had; life is a
                    property we do not understand; we can only see the necessary leading steps
                    towards it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ib.,</hi> p. 90.</p></note> As from life only, said he in one of
                    his lectures, we can gain an idea of death, so from death only we gain an idea
                    of life. Life, being an agency leading to, but not consisting of, any
                    modification of matter, “either is something superadded to matter, or else
                    consists in a peculiar arrangement of certain fine particles of matter, which
                    being thus disposed acquire the properties of life.” As a bar of iron may gain
                    magnetic virtue by being placed for a time in a special position, so perhaps the
                    particles of matter arranged. and long continued in a certain posture eventually
                    gain the power of life. ‘ ‘ I enquired of Mr Hunter,” writes one of his

                    its not taking Place. He did not deny that Equivocal Generation happened; there
                    were neither positive proofs for nor against its taking place.”</p>
                <p>To exemplify the differences between organic and inorganic growth, Hunter made
                    and employed in his lectures a collection of crystallized specimens of minerals,
                    or, as he termed them, “natural or native fossils.” Of fossils, designated by
                    him “extraneous fossils,” because extraneous respecting the rocks in which they
                    occur, he recognized the true nature, and he arranged them according to a system
                    agreeing with that adopted for recent organisms. The study of fossils enabled
                    him to apply his knowledge of the relations of the phenomena of life to
                    conditions, as exhibited in times present, to the elucidation of the history of
                    the earth in geological epochs. He observed the non-occurrence of fossils in
                    granite, but with his customary scientific caution and insight could perceive no
                    reason for supposing it to be the original matter of the globe, prior to
                    vegetable or animal, or that its formation was different from that of other
                    rocks. In water he recognized the chief agent in producing terrestrial changes
                    (c∕. <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Blood,</hi> p. 15, note); but the popular
                    notion that the Noachian deluge might account for the marine organisms
                    discovered on land he pointed out was untenable. From the diversity of the
                    situations in which many fossils and allied living structures are found, he was
                    led to infer that at various periods not only repeated oscillations of the level
                    of the land, lasting thousands of centuries, but also great climatic variations,
                    perhaps due to a change in the ecliptic, had taken place in geological times.
                    Hunter considered that very few fossils of those that resemble recent forms are
                    identical with them. He conceived that the latter might be varieties, but that
                    if <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> they are really different species, then “we must
                    suppose that a new creation must have taken place.” It would appear, therefore,
                    that the origin of species in variation had not struck him as possible. That he
                    believed varieties to have resulted from the influence of changes in the
                    conditions of life in times past is shown by a somewhat obscure passage in his
                    “Introduction to Natural History” <hi rend="italic">(Essays and
                    Observations,</hi> i. 4), in which he remarks, “But, I think, we have reason to
                    suppose that there was a period of time in which every species of natural
                    production was the same, there being then no variety in any species, and adds
                    that <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ‘ civilization has made varieties in manv
                    species, which are the domesticated.” Modem discoveries and doctrines as to the
                    succession of life in time are again foreshadowed by him in the observation in
                    his introduction to the description of drawings relative to incubation (quoted
                    in Pref, to <hi rend="italic">Cat. of Phys. Ser.,</hi> i. p. iv., 1833) that</p>
                <p>“If we were capable of following the progress of increase of the number of the
                    parts of the most perfect animal, as they first formed in succession, from the
                    very first, to its state of full perfection, we should probably be able to
                    compare it with some one of the incomplete animals themselves, of every order of
                    animals in the creation, being at no stage different from some of those inferior
                    orders; or, in other words, if we were to take a series of animals from the more
                    imperfect to the perfect, we should probably find an imperfect animal
                    corresponding with some stage of the most perfect.”</p>
                <p>In pathological phenomena Hunter discerned the results of the perturbation of
                    those laws of life by which the healthy organism subsists. With him pathology
                    was a science of vital dynamics. He afforded principles bearing not on single
                    complaints only, but on the effects of injury and disease in general. To attempt
                    to set forth what in Hunter’s teaching was new to pathology and systematic
                    surgery, or was rendered so by his mode of treatment, would be well-nigh to
                    present an epitome of all that he wrote on those subjects. “When we make a
                    discovery in pathology,” says Adams, writing in 1818, “we only learn what we
                    have overlooked in his writings or forgotten in his lectures.” Surgery, which
                    only in 1745 had formally ceased to be associated with “the art and mystery of
                    barbers,” he raised to the rank of a scientific profession. His doctrines were,
                    necessarily, not those of his age: while lesser minds around him were still dim
                    with the mists of the ignorance and dogmatism of times past, his lofty intellect
                    was illumined by the dawn of a distant day.</p>
