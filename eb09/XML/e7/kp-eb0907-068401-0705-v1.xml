                <p><label type="entry">EDWARD IV</label>. (1441-1483), king of England, was the
                    second son of Richard duke of York, and was born at Rouen, April 29, 1441. His
                    father was appointed protector of the kingdom during the incapacity of Henry
                    VI., and having in 1460 laid claim to the throne as a descendant of Edward III.,
                    was named by Parliament successor of Henry VL on condition that he allowed Henry
                    to retain his throne. As an heir had been born to the king, it was only natural
                    that Queen Margaret should seek to resist this proposal. She accordingly raised
                    an army against the duke of York, and he was defeated and slain at the battle of
                    Wakefield, December 30, 1460. Edward, who was at that time in Wales, on hearing
                    of his father’s death resolved to avenge it, and gathering a mixed army of Welsh
                    and English, defeated the earls of Pembroke and Ormond at Mortimer’s Cross in
                    Hereford, February 7, 1461. On February 17, Queen Margaret defeated the Yorkists
                    at St Albans; but Edward, notwithstanding her victory, having united his forces
                    with those under Warwick entered London, and, being received by the citizens
                    with loud shouts of welcome, was proclaimed king 4th March 1461. But he could
                    not permit himself to enjoy his dignities in idle security. King Henry had
                    escaped and joined the army of the queen, which, having withdrawn to the north,

                    Towton, about eight miles from York. Here Edward and Warwick met the queen’s
                    forces, and a battle of great obstinacy ensued, which, notwithstanding the
                    arrival of a reinforcement to Margaret in the middle of the battle, ended in her
                    utter defeat. Henry and Margaret fled to Scotland, and on the 28 J me Ed ward
                    was crowmed at London. Margaret afterwards escaped to France, from which country
                    in 1462 she made two separate attempts to retrieve the fallen fortunes of her
                    house, but these, as well as one made by Henry in 1464, proved utterly abortive.
                    In May 1461 Edward was secretly married to Elizabeth, daughter of Richard
                    Woodville, Lord Rivers, and widow of Sir John Gray; and having in the September
                    following publicly acknowledged her as his queen, he grievously disappointed and
                    displeased his chief supporter, the earl of Warwick, who had been negotiating
                    for the marriage of Edward with the sister of Louis XI. of France, Though from
                    this time secretly bending all his energies to accomplish Edward’s overthrow,
                    Warwick skilfully concealed not only his intentions but even his share in overt
                    acts; and it was not till 1369 that, receiving intelligence of the success of an
                    insurrection secretly fomented by him in Yorkshire, he showed his hand by taking
                    the king prisoner near Coventry. Shortly after, Edward either escaped or was
                    allowed his freedom; and in 1470 he defeated the rebels near Stamford, and
                    compelled Warwick to make his escape to France. Here the earl, through the good
                    offices of Louis, was reconciled with Queen Margaret, and agreed to invade
                    England in behalf of her husband. Landing at Dartmouth, he soon had an army of
                    60,000 men. Edward, taken by surprise and unable to raise a force sufficient to
                    oppose him, fled to Holland; and Warwick, having released Henry, again got him
                    acknowledged king. Edward in his turn adopted the tactics that had been
                    successful against him. In 1471 he landed at Ravenspur, and professing at first
                    to resign all claims to the throne, and to have no further aim than merely to
                    recover his inheritance as duke of York, he soon collected sympathizers, and
                    then, throwing off all disguise, issued proclamations against Henry and Warwick.
                    He marched without opposition direct to London, and after entering it and taking
                    Henry prisoner, advanced against the army which had been collected to oppose
                    him. The encounter took place at New Barnet, April 14, when the party of Warwick
                    were defeated and Warwick himself was slain. On the same day Margaret with her
                    son Edward, now eighteen years of age, had landed at Weymouth, but on May 4 she
                    was defeated at Tewkesbury and taken prisoner. Her son either perished in
                    battle, or was slain shortly afterwards by the order of the king; and her
                    husband Henry died in the Tower on May 21, the evening of the day on which
                    Edward re-entered London. Secure at home, Edward now turned his thoughts on
                    foreign conquest. In 1475 he formed an alliance with Charles of Burgundy against
                    Louis, but on landing on the Continent with a large army he learned that the
                    duke and Louis had come to an understanding, and prudence compelled him to enter
                    into a seven years’ treaty with the power he had hoped to conquer. Shortly after
                    this, the duke of Burgundy having died, Clarence, the brother of Edward, wished
                    to marry Mary, the duke’s daughter and heiress; but Edward, perhaps on account
                    of chagrin at the former deceit of her father, refused his consent to the suit.
                    Exasperated at his brother’s conduct, Clarence took no pains to conceal his
                    anger, and Edward thought it necessary to impeach him of treason before the
                    House of Lords. He was condemned to death, February 7, 1478, and on February 17
                    was executed in the Tower, but with so great secrecy that the manner of his
                    death is unknown. Edward died April 9, 1483. The beauty of his person and the
                    freedom of his manners rendered Edward a great favourite with the lower aud
                    middle classes, but there appears to have been little in his character to awaken
                    real esteem. He had certainly an ability for subtle scheming and intrigue, but
                    his memory is connected with no act conferring any benefit of importance on his
                    country, and it is tarnished by several deeds of ruthless cruelty, and by the
                    helpless self-indulgence into which he sank during his later years. On account
                    of the unsettled nature of the country during his reign, the influence of
                    Parliament on the affairs of the kingdom became virtually suspended; while the
                    antipathy and contentions between the two parties of the nobles made it almost a
                    necessity that that party which supported the king should be unable to present
                    any strong resistance against undue exercise of authority on his part. The
                    result was the inauguration of that form of despotism known as the New
                    Monarchy.</p>
