                    covered over with strong spines directed backwards, and on the back inwards so
                    as to cross each other on the middle line. The spines in the neighbourhood of
                    the tail form a tuft sufficient to hide that almost rudimentary organ. The head
                    is produced into a long tubular snout, covered with skin for the greater part of
                    its length. The opening of the mouth is small, and from it the echidna puts
                    forth its long slender tongue, lubricated with a viscous secretion, by means of
                    which it seizes the ants and other insects on which it feeds. It is entirely
                    destitute of teeth. Its legs are short and strong, and form, with its broad feet
                    and large solid nails, powerful burrowing organs. In common with the other
                    monotremes, the male echidna has its heel provided with a sharp hollow spur,
                    connected with a secreting gland, and with muscles capable of pressing the
                    secretion from the gland into the spur; but as the animal has never been
                    observed to use this in defending itself, the spur probably serves some other
                    purpose than that of offence or defence. It is a nocturnal or crepuscular
                    animal, generally sleeping during the day, but showing considerable activity by
                    night. When attacked it seeks to escape either by rolling itself into a ball,
                    its erect spines proving a formidable barrier to its capture, or by burrowing
                    into the sand, which its powerful limbs enable it to do with great celerity.
                    “The only mode of carrying the creature,” says Bennet <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Gatherings of a Naturalist in Australasia) “</hi> is by one of the hind legs,
                    when it may be removed to any place with great facility, for an attempt to seize
                    it by any other part of the body, from its powerful resistance and the sharpness
                    of the spines, will soon oblige the captor to relinquish his hold.” They are
                    exceedingly restless in confinement, and constantly endeavour by burrowing to
                    effect their escape. From the quantity of sand and mud always found in the
                    alimentary canal of the echidna, it is supposed that these ingredients must be
                    necessary to the proper digestion of its insect food. The only other members of
                    this family are the Short-spined Echidna <hi rend="italic">{Echidna setosd),
                    cοηhηed</hi> to Tasmania, and differing from the former species chiefly in the
                    shortness of its spines, which are nearly hidden by the long harsh fur, and the
                    Echidna Bruijnii—a new species discovered in 1877 in the mountains on the
                    north-east, coast of New Guinea, at an elevation of 3500 feet. By many
                    naturalists the generic term <hi rend="italic">Echidna</hi> has lately been
                    abandoned in favour of <hi rend="italic">Tachyglossτι,s</hi> of Illiger.</p>
