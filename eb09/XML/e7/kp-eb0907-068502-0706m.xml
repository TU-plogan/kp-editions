                <p><label type="entry">EDWARD VI</label>. (1537-1553), king of England, was the son
                    of Henry VIII. and of Jane Seymour, and was born at Hampton Court, 12th October
                    1537. “Till he came to six years old,” he says in his journal, “he was brought
                    up among the women.” He was then transferred to the direction of several
                    masters, who instructed him in Latin, Greek, French, philosophy, and divinity.
                    In his tenth year he was created prince of Wales and duke of Cornwall, and very
                    shortly afterwards he succeeded to the throne on the death of his father, 28th
                    January 1547. The will of Henry, for the protection of the young king, had named
                    merely a council of regency, but that council immediately chose Edward, earl of
                    Hertford, as protector, and on the 16th February ordered that he should be
                    created duke of Somerset. The leanings of the protector were strongly
                    Protestant, and he inaugurated his protectorate by the repeal of various Acts
                    whose tendency was to support the waning influence of the Church of Rome, and by

                    Though England was in a somewhat unsettled state, this did not prevent him from
                    planning an expedition against Scotland, on account of that power refusing to
                    fulfil a former treaty by which a marriage had been agreed upon between Mary
                    Queen of Scots and Edward. He defeated the Scots at the battle of Pinkie Cleugh,
                    September 10, 1547, and next year captured Haddington; but, on account of
                    growing dissensions at home, he was compelled to give up all further attempts
                    against Scottish independence. His brother, who had been created Lord Seymour of
                    Sudeley and made lord admiral of England, was suspected of being at the head of
                    a plot to overturn his authority, and with something of bravado admitted as much
                    as was sufficient to criminate himself, although he refused to answer in regard
                    to the more serious charges. In the House of Lords a bill was framed against him
                    which passed the House of Commons almost unanimously, and, it being assented to
                    by the king shortly afterwards, he was executed on Tower Hill, March 20, 1549.
                    In the following summer the distress consequent on the depreciation of the
                    currency and the wasteful expenditure of the court awakened a general
                    discontent, which in different parts of the kingdom broke out into open
                    insurrection. The protector, instead of repressing the rebellion by vigorous
                    measures, gave considerable concessions to the demands of the populace, his
                    sympathy with whom he openly admitted. By such an avowal he necessarily
                    alienated the nobility, and they speedily planned his overthrow. The council,
                    headed by Dudley, earl of Warwick, declared against him, deposed him, and
                    imprisoned him in the Tower, October 14, 1549. He regained his freedom shortly
                    afterwards, but a plot which he was concocting for the overthrow of Warwick
                    having prematurely come to light, he was again arrested in 1551, and being
                    convicted of high treason, he was executed on Tower Hill, January 22, 1552. The
                    king, who, except where his religious convictions were concerned, was a mere
                    puppet in the hands of the faction which at any time was paramount, yielded his
                    assent to the execution, apparently without any feelings of compunction.
                    Warwick, some time before this created duke of Northumberland, now exercised
                    absolute sway over the affairs of the kingdom, but he was hated by the populace,
                    and distrusted even by the friends who had raised him to power. He found it
                    necessary, therefore, to take further steps to guarantee the stability of his
                    authority. The king was dying rapidly of consumption, and his sister Mary being
                    heir to the throne, Northumberland could not hide from himself the probability
                    that his own overthrow would follow her accession. He therefore took advantage
                    of the king’s strong religious prejudices to persuade him to make a will,
                    excluding Mary and Elizabeth from the succession to the throne on the ground of
                    their illegitimacy, and nominating as his successor Lady Jane Grey, who was
                    married to the duke’s eldest son. The arbitrary urgency of Northumberland and
                    the religious obstinacy of Edward prevailed over the strong objections of the
                    judges, and letters patent being drawn out in accordance with the king’s wishes,
                    passed under the Great Seal, and were signed by the chief nobles, including,
                    although only after repeated endeavours to alter Edward’s determination,
                    Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury. Edward died July 4, 1553. There were some
                    suspicions that his death had been hastened by Northumberland, but although his
                    malady showed at last some symptoms of poisoning, it is now believed that these
                    were caused by accidental administrations of over-doses of mineral medicine. The
                    early age at which Edward VI. died makes it impossible to form a confident
                    estimate of his character and abilities. The exceptional talent which he
                    manifested in certain respects may have been due largely to the precocity caused
                    by disease. He was undoubtedly highly accomplished, but there is some reason for
                    suspecting that he was defective in force of character, and that he was too much
                    of a recluse to have become a successful ruler. His own writings show that he
                    was fully aware of the abuses which had crept into the administration of
                    affairs, and that he was conscientiously desirous that they should be remedied;
                    but they leave it uncertain whether he had the practical sagacity to discern the
                    true causes of these evils, and whether he had sufficient energy to remedy them
                    even had he known the proper remedies.</p>
