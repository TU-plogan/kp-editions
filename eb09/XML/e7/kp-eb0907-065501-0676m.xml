                    Longford, Ireland, where the Edgeworth family had been settled for upwards of
                    150 years. He was of gentle blood his father being the son of Colonel Francis
                    Edgeworth, and his mother, Jane Lovell, being the daughter of Samuel Lovell, a
                    Welsh judge. Richard’s mother taught him to read at a very eauly age; his young
                    imagination was nurtured on the beautiful stories in the book of Genesis and on
                    Shakespeare’s characters of Coriolanus and Julius Caesar; and, when he was only
                    seven years old, a Mr Deane explained to him the uses and structure of several
                    pieces of machinery, a circumstance to which he ever afterwards traced his
                    strong love for mechanical science. The Rev. Patrick Hughes initiated him in
                    Lilly’s <hi rend="italic">Latin Grammar—z</hi> tn office he also performed for
                    Goldsmith, who was born on the property of the Edgeworths—and his public
                    education began, m August 1752, in a school at Warwick. He subsequently attended
                    Drogheda school, then reputed the best in Ireland; and, after spending two years
                    at a school in Longford, entered Trinity College, Dublin, in April 1761, from
                    which he was transferred to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in October of the
                    same year. While still at college, he made a runaway match, marrying at Gretna
                    Green one of the daughters of Mr Paul Elers, an old friend of his father, by
                    whom he had a son, who was born before Edgeworth reached his twentieth
                    birth-day, and his daughter Maria. Shortly after the birth of his son, he and
                    his wife went to Edge worthtown, where he met a severe trial in the death of his
                    mother. Her dying advice to him, to “learn how to say no,” was the germ of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vivian,</hi> one of Miss Edgeworth’s best novels. For some time
                    after this Edgeworth devoted himself to scientific reading and experiments; and
                    he claims to be the reviver of telegraphic communication in modern times <hi
                    rend="italic">(Memoirs,</hi> second edition, i. 144). His home was now at Hare
                    Hatch, in Berkshire, where he endeavoured to educate his son according to the
                    method explained in Rousseau’s <hi rend="italic">Émile.</hi> In later life,
                    however, he saw reason to doubt many of Rousseau’s views <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Memoirs,</hi> ii. 374). At the same time he went on keeping terms at the
                    Temple, and formed the greatest friendship of his life with Thomas Day—an able
                    man, of noble character, excessively eccentric, and known to all boys as the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Sandford and Merton,</hi> which was written at
                    Edgeworth’s suggestion. In 1769, on the death of his father, he gave up the idea
                    of being a barrister; but, instead of immediately settling on his Irish estate,
                    he spent a considerable time in England and France, mainly in Day’s company. In
                    Lyons, where he resided for about two years, he took an active part in the
                    management of public works intended to turn the course of the Rhone. He was
                    summoned to England by the death of his wife, with whom his autobiography tells
                    us plainly he was not happy. Edgeworth hurried to Lichfield, to Dr Erasmus
                    Darwin’s, one of his greatest friends, and at once declared his passion for Miss
                    Honora Sneyd, which had been the cause of his flight to France two years before.
                    They were married (1773) in the cathedral, and after residing at Edgeworthtown
                    for three years, settled at Northchurch, in Hertfordshire. When six years of
                    great domestic happiness had elapsed, Mrs Honora Edgeworth died, after
                    recommending her husband to marry her sister Elizabeth —which he did, on
                    Christmas Day 1780. In 1782 Edgeworth returned to Ireland, determined to improve
                    his estate, educate his seven children, and ameliorate the condition of the
                    tenants. Up to this point Edgeworth has told his own story. The rest of his life
                    is written by his daughter, and opens with an account of the improvements he
                    effected, and a lengthy panegyric on Mr Edgeworth as a model landlord <hi
                    rend="italic">(Memoirs,</hi> ii. 12-36). In 1785 he was associated with others
                    in founding the Royal Irish Academy; and, during the two succeeding years,
                    mechanics and agriculture occupied most of his time. In October 1789 his friend
                    Day was killed by a fall from his horse, and this trial was soon followed by the
                    loss of a daughter, who had just reached her fifteenth <pb break="no"

                    his grief was the arrival of Dr Darwin’s poem, the <hi rend="italic">Botanic
                    Garden,</hi> about which the author says, “It was your early approbation that
                    contributed to encourage me to go on with the poem” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Memoirs,</hi> ii. 113). In 1792 the health of one of Edgeworth’s sons took him
                    to Clifton, where he remained with his family for about two years, returning in
                    1794 to Edgeworthtown. Ireland was, at that time, harassed by internal
                    disturbances, and threats of a French invasion, and Edgeworth offered to
                    establish telegraphic communication of his own invention throughout the country.
                    This offer was declined. A full account of the matter is given in Edgeworth’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Letter to Lord Charlemont on the Telegraph;</hi> and his
                    apparatus is explained in an “Essay on the Art of Conveying Swift and Secret
                    Intelligence,” published in the sixth volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Poyal Irish Academy.</hi> In the autumn of 1797 Mrs
                    Edgeworth fell a victim to decline. <hi rend="italic">Practical Education,</hi>
                    a work which embodied the experience of the authors in dealing with children,
                    was published in 1798. “So commenced,” says Miss Edgeworth,</p>
                <p>“that literary partnership which, for so many years, was the pride and joy of my
                    life” <hi rend="italic">(Memoirs,</hi> ii. 170). In the same year Edgeworth
                    married Miss Beaufort, and was elected M.P. for the borough of St John’s Town,
                    Longford. The same year, too, saw a hostile landing of the French and a
                    formidable rebellion; and for a short time the Edgeworths took refuge in
                    Longford. The spring of 1802 brought the depressing announcement of Dr Darwin’s
                    death; and the winter of that year was spent by the Edgeworths in Paris, where,
                    among many friends, they particularly valued M. Dumont. On his return home he
                    was gratified by Government accepting of his telegraphic apparatus, which worked
                    admirably. In 1802 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Irish Bulls</hi> by
                    Mr and Miss Edgeworth; and in 1806 Edgeworth was elected a member of the Board
                    of Commissioners to inquire into Irish education. From 1807 till 1809 much of
                    his time was spent on mechanical experiments and in writing the story of his
                    life. In 1808 appeared <hi rend="italic">Professional Education,</hi> and in
                    1813 his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Construction of Roads and
                    Carriages.</hi> He died on the 13th of June 1817, and was buried in the family
                    vault in Edgeworthtown churchyard.</p>
                <p>Many of Edgeworth’s works were suggested by his zeal for the education of his own
                    children. Such were <hi rend="italic">Poetry Explained for Young People,
                    Readings on Poetry, A Rational Primer,</hi> and the farts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Early Lessons</hi> contributed by him. His speeches in the rish Parliament have
                    also been published; and numerous essays, mostly on scientific subjects, have
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monthly Magazine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nicholson's
                    Journal.</hi> The story of his early life, told by himself, is fully as
                    entertaining as the continuation by Maria, as it contains less dissertation and
                    more incident. (T. GI. )</p>
