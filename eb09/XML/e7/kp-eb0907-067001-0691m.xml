                <p><label type="entry">EDUCATION</label>. This article is mainly concerned with the
                    history of educational theories in the chief crises of their development. It has
                    not been the object of the writer to give a history of the practical working of
                    these theories, and still less to sketch the outlines of the science of
                    teaching, w hich may be more conveniently dealt with under another head. The
                    earliest education is that of the family. The child must be trained not to
                    interfere with its parents’ convenience, and to acquire those little arts which
                    will help in maintaining the economy of the household. It was long before any
                    attempt was made to improve generations as they succeeded each other. The
                    earliest schools were those of the priests. As soon as an educated priesthood
                    had taken the place of the diviners and jugglers who abused the credulity of the
                    earliest races, schools of the prophets became a necessity. The training
                    required for ceremonials, the common life apart from the family, the
                    accomplishments of reading and singing, afforded a nucleus for the organization
                    of culture and an opportunity for the efforts of a philosopher in advance of his
                    age. Convenience and gratitude confirmed the monopoly of the clergy. The schools
                    of Judea and Egypt were ecclesiastical. The Jews had but little effect on the
                    progress of science, but our obligations to the priests of the Nile valley are
                    great indeed. Much of their learning is obscure to us, but we have reason to
                    conclude that there is no branch of science in which they did not progress at
                    least so far as observation and careful registration of facts could carry them.
                    They <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n692/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0692-0671"/> were a source of enlightenment to surrounding
                    nations. Not only the great lawgiver of the Jews, but those who were most active
                    in stimulating the nascent energies of Hellas were careful to train themselves
                    in the wisdom of the Egyptians. Greece, in giving an undying name to the
                    literature of Alexandria, was only repaying the debt which she had incurred
                    centuries before. Education became secular in countries where the priesthood did
                    not exist as a separate body. At Rome, until Greece took her conqueror captive,
                    a child was trained for the duties of life in the forum and the senate house.
                    The Greeks were the first to develop a science of education distinct from
                    ecclesiastical training. They divided their subjects of study into music and
                    gymnastics, the one comprising all mental, the other all physical training.
                    Music was at first little more than the study of the art of expression. But the
                    range of intellectual education which had been developed by distinguished
                    musical teachers was further widened by the Sophists, until it received a new
                    stimulus and direction from the work of Socrates. Who can forget the picture
                    left us by Plato of the Athenian palaestra, in which Socrates was sure to find
                    his most ready listeners and his most ardent disciples 1 In the intervals of
                    running, wrestling, or the bath, the young Phaedrus or Theaetetus discoursed
                    with the philosophers who had come to watch them on the good, the beautiful, and
                    the true. The lowest efforts of their teachers were to fit them to maintain any
                    view they might adopt with acuteness, flegance, readiness, and good taste. Their
                    highest efforts were to stimulate a craving for the knowledge of the unknowable,
                    to rouse a dissatisfaction with received opinions, and to excite a curiosity
                    which grew stronger with the revelation of each successive mystery. Plato is the
                    author of the first systematic treatise on education. He deals with the subject
                    in his earlier dialogues, he enters into it with great fulness of detail in the
                    <hi rend="italic">liepublic,</hi> and it occupies an important position in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Laws.</hi> The views thus expressed differ considerably in
                    particulars, and it is therefore difficult to give concisely the precepts drawn
                    up by him for our obedience. But the same spirit underlies his whole teaching.
                    He never forgets that the beautiful is undistinguishable from the true, and that
                    the mind is best fitted to solve difficult problems which has been trained by
                    the enthusiastic contemplation of art. Plato proposes to intrust education to
                    the state. He lays great stress on the influence of race and blood. Strong and w
                    orthy children are likely to spring from strong and worthy parents. Music and
                    gymnastics are to develop the emotions of young men during their earliest
                    years,—the one to strengthen their character for the contest of life, the other
                    to excite in them varying feelings of resentment or tenderness. Reverence, the
                    ornament of youth, is to be called forth by well-chosen fictions j a long and
                    rigid training in science is to precede discussion on more important subjects.
                    At length the goal is reached, and the ripest wisdom is ready to be applied to
                    the most important practice.</p>
                <p>The great work of Quintilian, although mainly a treatise on oratory, also
                    contains incidentally a complete sketch of a theoretical education. His object
                    is to show us how to form the man of practice. But what a high conception of
                    practice is his. He wrote for a race of rulers. He inculcates much which has
                    been attributed to the wisdom of a later age. He urges the importance of
                    studying individual dispositions, and of tenderness in discipline and
                    punishment. The Romans understood no systematic training except in oratory. In
                    their eyes every citizen was a born commander, and they knew of no science of
                    government and political economy. Cicero speaks slightingly even of
                    jurisprudence. Any one, he says, can make himself a jurisconsult in a week, but
                    an orator is the production of a lifetime. No statement can be less true than
                    that a perfect orator is a perfect man. But wisdom and philanthropy broke even
                    through that barrier, and the training which Quintilian expounds to us as
                    intended only for the public speaker would, in the language of Milton, fit a man
                    to perform justly, wisely, and magnanimously all the offices, both public and
                    private, of peace and war.</p>
                <p>Such are the ideas which the old world has left us. On one side man beautiful,
                    active, clever, receptive, emotional, quick to feel, to show his feeling, to
                    argue, to refine; greedy of the pleasures of the world, perhaps a little
                    neglectful of its duties, fearing restraint as an unjust stinting of the bounty
                    of nature, inquiring eagerly into every secret, strongly attached to the things
                    of this life, but elevated by an unabated striving after the highest ideal;
                    setting no value but upon faultless abstractions, and seeing reality only in
                    heaven, on earth mere shadows, phantoms, and copies of the unseen. On the other
                    side man practical, energetic, eloquent, tinged but not imbued with philosophy,
                    trained to spare neither himself nor others, reading and thinking only with an
                    apology; best engaged in defending a political principle, in maintaining with
                    gravity and solemnity the conservation of ancient freedom, in leading armies
                    through unexplored deserts, establishing roads, fortresses, settlements, the
                    results of conquest, or in ordering and superintending the slow, certain, and
                    utter annihilation of some enemy of Rome. Has the modern world ever surpassed
                    their type? Can we in the present day produce anything by education except by
                    combining, blending, and modifying the self-culture of the Greek or the
                    self-sacrifice of the Roman?</p>
                <p>The literary education of the earliest generation of Christians was obtained in
                    the pagan schools, in those great imperial academies which existed even down to
                    the 5th century, which flourished in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and attained
                    perhaps their highest development and efficiency in Gaul. The first attempt to
                    provide a special education for Christians was made at Alexandria, and is
                    illustrated by the names of Clement and Origen. The later Latin fathers took a
                    bolder stand, and rejected the suspicious aid of heathenism. Tertullian,
                    Cyprian, and Jerome wished the antagonism between Christianity and Paganism to
                    be recognized from the earliest years, and even Augustine condemned with
                    harshness the culture to which he owed so much of his influence. The education
                    of the Middle Ages was either that of the cloister or the castle. They stood in
                    sharp contrast to each other. The object of the one was to form the young monk,
                    of the other the young knight. We should indeed be ungrateful if we forgot the
                    services of those illustrious monasteries, Monte Cassino, Fulda, or Tours, which
                    kept alive the torch of learning throughout the dark ages, but it would be
                    equally mistaken to attach an exaggerated importance to the teaching which they
                    provided. Long hours were spent in the duties of the church, and in learning to
                    take a part in elaborate and useless ceremonies. A most important part of the
                    monastery was the writing room, where missals, psalters, and breviaries were
                    copied and illuminated, and too often a masterpiece of classic literature was
                    effaced to make room for a treatise of one of the fathers or the sermon of an
                    abbot. The discipline was hard; the rod ruled all with indiscriminating and
                    impartial severity. How many generations have had to suffer for the floggings of
                    those times! Hatred of learning, antagonism between the teacher and the taught,
                    the belief that no training can be effectual which is not repulsive and
                    distasteful, that no subject is proper for instruction which is acquired with
                    ease and pleasure,—all these idols of false education have their root and origin
                    in monkish cruelty. The joy of human life would have been in danger of being
                    stamped out if it had not been for the warmth and colour of a young knight’s
                    boyhood. He was equally well <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0693-0672"/> broken in to obedience and hardship, but the
                    obedience was the willing service of a mistress whom he loved, and the hardship
                    the permission to share the dangers of a leader whom he emulated. The seven arts
                    of monkish training were Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric, Music, Arithmetic,
                    Geometry, Astronomy, which together formed the <hi rend="italic">trivium</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">quadrivium,</hi> the seven years’ course, the divisions of
                    which have profoundly affected our modem training. One of the earliest treatises
                    based on this method was that of Martianus Capella, who in 470 published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Satyra,</hi> in nine books. The first two were devoted to the
                    marriage between Philology and Mercury, the last seven were each devoted to the
                    consideration of one of these liberal arts. Cassiodorus, who wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Septem Disciplinis</hi> about 500, was
                    also largely used as a text book in the schools. Astronomy was taught by the
                    Cisio-Janus, a collection of doggrel hexameters like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Propria</hi><hi rend="italic">quae</hi><hi rend="italic">maribus,</hi> which
                    contained the chief festivals in each month, with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >memoria</hi><hi rend="italic">technica</hi> for recollecting when they
                    occurred. The seven knightly accomplishments, as historians tell us, were to
                    ride, to swim, to shoot with the bow, to box, to hawk, to play chess, and to
                    make verses. The verses thus made were not in Latin, bald imitations of Ovid or
                    Horace, whose pagan beauties were wrested into the service of religion, but
                    sonnets, ballads, and canzonets in soft Provençal or melodious Italian. In
                    nothing, perhaps, is the difference between these two forms of education more
                    clearly shown than in their relations to women. A young monk was brought up to
                    regard a woman as the worst among the many temptations of St Antony. His life
                    knew no domestic tenderness or affection. He was surrounded and cared for by
                    celibates, to be himself a celibate. A page was trained to receive his best
                    reward and worst punishment from the smile or frown of the lady of the castle,
                    and as he grew to manhood to cherish an absorbing passion as the strongest
                    stimulus to a noble life, and the contemplation of female virtue, as embodied in
                    an Isolde or a Beatrice, as the truest earnest of future immortality.</p>
                <p>Both these forms of education disappeared before the Renaissance and the
                    Reformation. But we must not suppose that no efforts were made to improve upon
                    the narrowness of the schoolmen or the idleness of chivalry. The schools of
                    Charles the Great have lately been investigated by Mr Mullinger, but we do not
                    find that they materially advanced the science of education. Vincent of Beauvais
                    has left us a very complete treatise on education, written about the year 1245.
                    He was the friend and counsellor of St Louis, and we may discern his influence
                    in the instructions which were left by that sainted king for the guidance of his
                    son and daughter through life. The end of this period was marked by the rise of
                    universities. Bologna devoted itself to law, and numbered 12,000 students at the
                    end of the 12th century. Salerno adopted as its special province the study of
                    medicine, and Paris was thronged with students from all parts of Europe, who
                    were anxious to devote themselves to a theology which passed by indefinite
                    gradations into philosophy. The 14th and 15th centuries witnessed the rise of
                    universities and academies in almost every portion of Europe. Perhaps the most
                    interesting among these precursors of a higher culture were the Brethren of the
                    Common Life, who were domiciled in the rich meadows of the Yssel, in the
                    Northern Netherlands. The metropolis of their organization was Deventer, the
                    best known name among them that of Gerhard Groote. They devoted themselves with
                    all humility and self-sacrifice to the education of children. Their schools were
                    crowded. Bois-le-duc numbered 1200 pupils, Zwolle 1500. For a hundred years no
                    part of Europe shone with a brighter lustre. As the divine comedy of Dante
                    represents for us the learning and piety of the Middle Ages in Italy, so the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dnitatioη</hi> of Thomas à Kempis keeps alive for us the memory of
                    the purity and sweetness of the Dutch community. But they had not sufficient
                    strength to preserve their supremacy among the necessary developments of the
                    age. They could not support the glare of the new Italian learning; they
                    obtained, and it may be feared deserved, the title of obscurantists. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistoloe</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurorum Virorum,</hi> the
                    wittiest squib of the Middle Ages, which was so true and so subtle in its satire
                    that it was hailed as a blow struck in defence of the ancient learning, consists
                    in great part of the lamentations of the brethren of Deventer over the new age,
                    which they could not either comprehend or withstand. The education of the
                    Renaissance is best represented by the name of Erasmus, that of the Reformation
                    by the names of Luther and Melanchthon. We have no space to give an account of
                    that marvellous resurrection of the mind and spirit of Europe when touched by
                    the dead hand of an extinct civilization. The history of the revival of letters
                    belongs rather to the general history of literature than to that of education.
                    But there are two names whom we ought not to pass over. Vittorino da Feltre was
                    summoned by the Gonzagas to Mantua in 1424; he was lodged in a spacious palace,
                    with galleries, halls, and colonnades decorated with frescoes of playing
                    children. In person he was small, quick, and lively—a born schoolmaster, whose
                    whole time was spent in devotion to his pupils. We are told of the children of
                    his patron, how Prince Gonzaga recited 200 verses of his own composition at the
                    age of fourteen, and how Princess Cecilia wrote elegant Greek at the age of ten.
                    Vittorino died in 1477. He seems to have reached the highest point of excellence
                    as a practical schoolmaster of the Italian Renaissance. Castiglione, on the
                    other hand, has left us in his <hi rend="italic">Cortigiano</hi> the sketch of a
                    cultivated nobleman in those most cultivated days. He shows by what precepts and
                    practice the golden youths of Verona and Venice were formed, who live for us in
                    the plays of Shakespeare as models of knightly excellence. For our instruction,
                    it is better to have recourse to the pages of Erasmus. He has written the most
                    minute account of his method of teaching. The child is to be formed into a good
                    Greek and Latin scholar and a pious man. He fully grasps the truth that
                    improvement must be natural and gradual. Letters are to be taught playing. The
                    rules of grammar are to be few and short. Every means of arousing interest in
                    the work is to be fully employed. Erasmus is no Ciceronian. Latin is to be
                    taught so as to be of use—a living language adapted to modem wants. Children
                    should learn an art—painting, sculpture, or architecture. Idleness is above all
                    things to be avoided. The education of girls is as necessary and important as
                    that of boys. Much depends upon home influence; obedience must be strict, but
                    not too severe. We must take account of individual peculiarities, and not force
                    children into cloisters against their will. We shall obtain the best result by
                    following nature. It is easy to see what a contrast this scheme presented to the
                    monkish training,—to the routine of useless technicalities enforced amidst the
                    shouts of teachers and the lamentations of the taught.</p>
                <p>Still this culture was but for the few. Luther brought the schoolmaster into the
                    cottage, and laid the foundations of the system which is the chief honour and
                    strength of modem Germany, a system by which the child of the humblest peasant,
                    by slow but certain gradations, receives the best education which the country
                    can afford. The precepts of Luther found their way into the hearts of his
                    countryman in short, pithy sentences, like the sayings of poor Richard. The
                    purification and widening of education went hand in hand with the purification
                    of religion, and these claims to affection are indissolubly united in the minds
                    of his countrymen. Melanchthon, from his editions <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n694/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0694-0673"/> of school books and his practical labours in
                    education, earned the title of Praeceptor Germaniae. Aristotle had been
                    dethroned from his pre-eminence in the schools, and Melanchthon attempted to
                    supply his place. He appreciated the importance of Greek, the terror of the
                    obscurantists, and is the author of a Greek grammar. He wrote elementary books
                    on each department of the <hi rend="italic">trivium—</hi> grammar, dialectic,
                    and rhetoric. He made some way with the studies of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrivium,</hi> and wrote <hi rend="italic">Initia doctrinoe Physicoe,</hi> a
                    primer of physical science. He lectured at the university of Wittenberg, and for
                    ten years, from 1519 to 1529, kept a <hi rend="italic">schola privata</hi> in
                    his own house. Horace was his favourite classic. His pupils were taught to learn
                    the whole of it by heart, ten lines at a time. The tender refined lines of his
                    well-known portraits show clearly the character of the painful, accurate
                    scholar, and contrast with the burly powerful form of the genial Luther. He died
                    in 1560, racked with anxiety for the church which he had helped to found. If he
                    did not carry Protestantism into the heart of the peasant, he at least made it
                    acceptable to the intellect of the man of letters.</p>
                <p>We now come to the names of three theoretical and practical teachers who have
                    exercised and are still exercising a profound effect over education. The
                    so-called Latin school, the parent of the gymnasium and the lycée, had spread
                    all over Europe, and was especially flourishing in Germany. The programmes and
                    time tables in use in these establishments have come down to us, and we possess
                    notices of the lives and labours of many of the earliest teachers. It is not
                    difficult to trace a picture of the education which the Reformation offered to
                    the middle classes of Europe. Ample materials exist in German histories of
                    education. We must confine ourselves to those moments which were of vital
                    influence in the development of the science. One school stands pre-eminently
                    before the rest, situated in that border city on the debatable land between
                    France and Germany, which has known how to combine and reconcile the
                    peculiarities of French and German culture. Strasburg, besides a school of
                    theology which unites the depth of Germany to the clearness and vivacity of
                    France, educated the gilded youth of the 16th century under Sturm, as it trained
                    the statesmen and diplomatists of the 18th under Koch. John Sturm of Strasburg
                    was the friend of Ascham, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Scholemaster,</hi>
                    and the tutor of Queen Elizabeth. It was Ascham who found Lady Jane Grey alone
                    in her room at Bradgate bending her neck over the page of Plato when all the
                    rest of her family were following the chase. Sturm was the first great head
                    master, the progenitor of Busbys if not of Arnolds. He lived and worked till the
                    age of eighty-two. He was a friend of all the most distinguished men of his age,
                    the chosen representative of the Protestant cause in Europe, the ambassador to
                    foreign powers. He was believed to be better informed than any man of his time
                    of the complications of foreign politics. Rarely did an envoy pass from France
                    to Germany without turning aside to profit by his experience. But the chief
                    energies of his life were devoted to teaching. He drew his scholars from the
                    whole of Europe; Portugal, Poland, England sent their contingent to his halls.
                    In 1578 his school numbered several thousand students; he supplied at once the
                    place of the cloister and the castle. What he most insisted upon was the
                    teaching of Latin, not the conversational <hi rend="italic">lingua franca</hi>
                    of Erasmus, but pure, elegant Ciceronian Latinity. He may be called the
                    introducer of scholarship into the schools, a scholarship which as yet took
                    little account of Greek. His pupils would write elegant letters, deliver elegant
                    Latin speeches, be familiar, if not with the thoughts, at least with the
                    language of the ancients, would be scholars in order that they might be
                    gentlemen. Our space will not permit us to trace the whole course of his
                    influence, but he is in all probability as much answerable as any one for the
                    euphuistic refinement which overspread Europe in the 16th century, and which
                    went far to ruin and corrupt its literatures. Nowhere perhaps had he more effect
                    than in England. Our older public schools, on breaking with the ancient faith,
                    looked to Sturm as their model of Protestant education. His name and example
                    became familiar to us by the exertions of his friend Ascham. Westminster, under
                    the long reign of Busby, received a form which was generally accepted as the
                    type of a gentleman’s education. The Public School Commission of 1862 found that
                    the lines laid down by the great citizen of Strasburg, and copied by his
                    admirers, had remained unchanged until within the memory of the present
                    generation. Wolfgang Ratke or Ratichius was born in Holstein in 1571. He
                    anticipated some of the best improvements in the method of teaching which have
                    been made in modern times. He was like many of those who have tried to improve
                    existing methods in advance of his age, and he was rewarded for his labours at
                    Augsburg, Weimar, and Köthen by persecution and imprisonment. Can we wonder that
                    education has improved so slowly when so much pains has been taken to silence
                    and extinguish those who have devoted themselves to its improvement? His chief
                    rules were as follows. 1. Begin everything with prayer. 2. Do everything in
                    order, following the course of nature. 3. One thing at a time. 4. Often repeat
                    the same thing. 5. Teach everything first in the mother tongue. 6. Proceed from
                    the mother tongue to other languages. 7. Teach without compulsion. Do not beat
                    children to make them learn. Pupils must love their masters, not hate them.
                    Nothing should be learnt by heart. Sufficient time should be given to play and
                    recreation. Learn one thing before going on to another. Do not teach for two
                    hours consecutively. 8. Uniformity in teaching, also in school books, especially
                    grammars, which may with advantage be made comparative. 9. Teach a thing first,
                    and then the reason of it. Give no rules before you have given the examples.
                    Teach no language out of the grammar, but out of authors. 10. Let everything be
                    taught by induction and experiment. Most of these precepts are accepted by all
                    good teachers in the present day; all of them are full of wisdom. Unfortunately
                    their author saw the faults of the teaching of his time more clearly than the
                    means to remove them, and he was more successful in forming precepts than in
                    carrying them out. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, he deserves an honourable
                    place among the forerunners of a rational education.</p>
                <p>John Amos Comenius was the antithesis to Sturm, and a greater man than Ratke.
                    Born a Moravian, he passed a wandering life, among the troubles of the Thirty
                    Years’ War, in poverty and obscurity. But his ideas were accepted by the most
                    advanced thinkers of the age, notably in many respects by our own Milton, and by
                    Oxenstiern the chancellor of Sweden. His school books were spread throughout
                    Europe. The <hi rend="italic">Janua</hi><hi rend="italic">Linguarum
                    Peserata</hi> was translated into twelve European and several Asiatic languages.
                    His works, especially the <hi rend="italic">Didascalia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >magna,</hi> an encyclopaedia of the science of education, are constantly
                    reprinted at the present day; and the system which he sketched will be found to
                    foreshadow the education of the future. He was repelled and disgusted by the
                    long delays and pedantries of the schools. His ardent mind conceived that if
                    teachers would but follow nature instead of forcing it against its bent, take
                    full advantage of the innate desire for activity and growth, all men might be
                    able to learn all things. Languages should be taught as the mother tongue is
                    taught, by conversations on ordinary topics; pictures, object lessons, should be
                    freely used; teaching should go hand in hand with a cheerful, elegant, and happy
                    life. Comenius included in his course <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n695/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0695-0674"/> the teaching of the mother tongue, singing,
                    economy, and politics, the history of the world, physical geography, and a
                    knowledge of arte and handicrafts. But the principle on which he most insisted,
                    which forms the special point of his teaching, and in which he is followed by
                    Milton, is that the teaching of words and things must go together hand in hand.
                    When we consider how much time is spent over new languages, what waste of energy
                    is lavished on mere preparation, how it takes so long to lay a foundation that
                    there is no time to rear a building upon it, we must conclude that it is in the
                    acceptance and development of this principle that the improvement of education
                    will in the future consist. Any one who attempts to inculcate this great reform
                    will find that its first principles are contained in the writings of Comenius.
                    But this is not the whole of his claim upon our gratitude. He was one of the
                    first advocates of the teaching of science in schools. His kindness, gentleness,
                    and sympathy make him the forerunner of Pestalozzi. His general principles of
                    education would not sound strange in the treatise of Herbert Spencer.</p>
                <p>The Protestant schools were now the best in Europe, and the monkish institutions
                    were left to decay. Catholics would have remained behind in the race if it had
                    not been for the Jesuits. Ignatius Loyola gave this direction to the order which
                    he founded, and the programme of studies, which dates from the end of the 16th
                    century, is in use, with certain modifications, in English Jesuit schools at the
                    present day. In 1550 the first Jesuit school was opened in Germany; in 1700 the
                    order possessed 612 colleges, 157 normal schools, 59 noviciates, 340 residences,
                    200 missions, 29 professed homes, and 24 universities. The college of Clermont
                    had 3000 students in 1695. Every Jesuit college was divided into two parts, the
                    one for higher the other for lower education,—the <hi rend="italic">studia
                    superiora,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">studia inferiora.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">studia inferiora,</hi> answering to the modern gymnasium, was
                    divided into five classes. The first three were classes of grammar (rudiments),
                    grammar (accidence), and syntax, the last two humanity and rhetoric. The motto
                    of the schools was <hi rend="italic">lege, scribe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >loquere,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> you must learn not only to read and write
                    a dead language, but to talk. Purism was even more exaggerated than by Sturm. No
                    word might be used which did not rest upon a special authority. The composition
                    of Latin verses was strongly encouraged, and the performance of Latin plays.
                    Greek was studied to some extent; mathematics, geography, music, and the mother
                    tongues were neglected. The <hi rend="italic">studia superiora</hi> began with a
                    philosophical course of two or three years. In the first year logic was taught,
                    in the second the books of Aristotle <hi rend="italic">de ccelo,</hi> the first
                    book <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">generatione,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meteorologica.</hi> In the third year the second book <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">generatione,</hi> the books <hi
                    rend="italic">de anima,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics.</hi> After
                    the completion of the philosophical course the pupil studied theology for four
                    years. The Jesuits used to the full the great engine of emulation. Their classes
                    were divided into two parts, Romans and Carthaginians; swords, shields, and
                    lances hung on the walls, and were carried off in triumph as either party
                    claimed the victory by a fortunate answer. It would be unfair to deny the merits
                    of the education of the Jesuits. Bacon speaks of them in more than one passage
                    as the revivers of this most important art. <hi rend="italic">Quum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">talis</hi><hi rend="italic">sis utinam nοster esses.</hi>
                    Descartes approved of their system; Chateaubriand regarded their suppression as
                    a calamity to civilization and enlightenment. They were probably tfie first to
                    bring the teacher into close connection with the taught. According to their
                    ideal the teacher was neither inclosed in a cloister, secluded from his pupils,
                    nor did he keep order by stamping, raving, and flogging. He was encouraged to
                    apply his mind and soul to the mind and soul of his pupil; to study the nature,
                    the disposition, the parents of his scholars; to follow nature as far as
                    possible, or rather to lie in wait for it and discover its weak points, and
                    where it could be most easily attacked. Doubtless the Jesuits have shown a love,
                    devotion, and selfsacrifice in education, which is worthy of the highest praise;
                    no teacher who would compete with them can dare do less. On the other hand, they
                    are open to grave accusation. Their watchful care degenerated into surveillance,
                    which lay-schools have borrowed from them; their study of nature has led them to
                    confession and direction. They have tracked out the soul to its recesses, that
                    they might slay it there, and generate another in its place; they educated each
                    mind according to its powers, that it might be a more subservient tool to their
                    own purposes. They taught the accomplishments which the world loves, but their
                    chief object was to amuse the mind and stifle inquiry; they encouraged Latin
                    verses, because they were a convenient plaything on which powers might be
                    exercised which could have been better employed in understanding and discussing
                    higher subjects; they were the patrons of school plays, of public prizes,
                    declamations, examinations, and other exhibitions, in which the parents were
                    more considered than the boys; they regarded the claims of education, not as a
                    desire to be encouraged, but as a demand to be played with and propitiated; they
                    gave the best education of their time in order to acquire confidence, but they
                    became the chief obstacle to the improvement of education; they did not care for
                    enlightenment, but only for the influence which they could derive from a
                    supposed regard for enlightenment. Whatever may have been the service of Jesuits
                    in past times, we have little to hope for them in the improvement of education
                    at present. Governments have, on the whole, acted wisely by checking and
                    suppressing their colleges. The <hi rend="italic">ratio studiorum</hi> is
                    antiquated and difficult to reform. In 1831 it was brought more into accordance
                    with modern ideas by Roothaan, the general of the order. Beckx his successor
                    has, if anything, pursued a policy of retrogression. The Italian Government, in
                    taking possessi on of Rome, found that the pupils of the Collegio Romano were
                    far below the level of modern requirements.</p>
                <p>It may be imagined that, by this organization both Catholics and Protestants were
                    apt to degenerate into pedantry, both in name and purpose. The schoolmaster had
                    a great deal too much the best of it. The Latin school was tabulated and
                    organized until every half hour of a boy’s time was occupied; the Jesuit school
                    took possession of the pupil body and soul. It was, therefore, to be expected
                    that a stand should be made for common sense in the direction of practice rather
                    than theory, of wisdom instead of learning. Montaigne has left us the most
                    delightful utterances about education. He says that the faults of the education
                    of his day consist in over-estimating the intellect and rejecting morality, in
                    exaggerating memory and depreciating useful knowledge. He recommends a tutor who
                    should draw out the pupil’s own power and originality, to teach how to live well
                    and to die well, to enforce a lesson by practice, to put the mother tongue
                    before foreign tongues, to teach all manly exercises, to educate the perfect
                    man. Away with force and compulsion, with severity and the rod. John Locke, more
                    than a hundred years afterwards, made a more powerful and systematic attack upon
                    useless knowledge. His theory of the origin of ideas led him to assign great
                    importance to education, while his knowledge of the operations of the human mind
                    lends a special vahie to his advice. His treatise has received in England more
                    attention than it deserves, partly because we have so few books written upon the
                    subject on which he treats. Part of his advice is useless at the present day;
                    part it would be well to follow, or at any rate to consider seriously,
                    especially his condemnation<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0696-0675"/> of repetition by heart as a means of
                    strengthening the memory, and of Latin verses and themes. He sets before himself
                    the production of the man, a sound mind in a sound body. His knowledge of
                    medicine gives great value to his advice on the earliest education, although he
                    probably exaggerates the benefits of enforced hardships. He recommends home
                    education without harshness or severity of discipline. Emulation is to be the
                    chief spring of action; knowledge is far less valuable than a well-trained mind.
                    He prizes that knowledge most which fits a man for the duties of the world,
                    speaking languages, accounts, history, law, logic, rhetoric, natural philosophy.
                    He inculcates the importance of drawing, dancing, riding, fencing, and trades.
                    The part of his advice which made most impression upon his contemporaries was
                    the teaching of reading and arithmetic by well-considered games, the
                    discouragement of an undue compulsion and punishment, and the teaching of
                    language without the drudgery of grammar. In these respects he has undoubtedly
                    anticipated modern disco’eries. He is a strong advocate for home education under
                    a private tutor, and his bitterness against public schools is as vehement as
                    that of Cowper.</p>
                <p>Far more important in the literature of this subject than the treatise of Locke
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Tractate of Education</hi> by Milton, “the few
                    observations,” as he tells us, “which flowered off, and are, as it were, the
                    burnishings of many studious and contemplative years spent in the search for
                    civil and religious knowledge.” This essay is addressed to Samuel Hartlib, a
                    great friend of Comenius, and probably refers to a project of establishing a
                    university in London. “I will point you out,” Milton says, “the right path of a
                    virtuous and noble education,—laborious, indeed, at first ascent, but else so
                    smooth and green and full of goodly prospects and melodious sounds on every
                    side, that the harp of Orpheus is not more charming. This is to be done between
                    twelve and one-and-twenty, in an academy containing about a hundred and thirty
                    scholars, which shall be at once school and university,—not needing a remove to
                    any other house of scholarship except it be some peculiar college of law and
                    physics, where they mean to be practitioners.” The important truth enunciated is
                    quite in the spirit of Comenius that the learning of things and words is to go
                    hand in hand. The curriculum is very large. Latin, Greek, arithmetic, geometry,
                    agriculture, geography, physiology, physics, trigonometry, fortification,
                    architecture, engineering, navigation, anatomy, medicine, poetry, Italian, law
                    both Roman and English, Hebrew with Chaldee and Syriac, history, oratory,
                    poetics. But the scholars are not to be book-worms. They are to be trained for
                    war, both on foot and on horseback, to be practised “in all the locks and gripes
                    of wrestling,” they are to “recreate and compose their travailed spirits with
                    the divine harmonies of music heard or learnt.” “In those vernal seasons of the
                    year when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and a sullenness
                    against nature not to go out and see her riches, and partake in her rejoicing
                    with heaven and earth. I should not then be a persuader to them of studying much
                    then, after two or three years that they have well laid their grounds, but to
                    ride out in companies with prudent and staid guides to all the quarters of the
                    land.” The whole treatise is full of wisdom, and deserves to be studied again
                    and again. Visionary, as it may appear to some at first sight, if translated
                    into the language of our own day, it will be found to abound with sound
                    practical advice. “Only,” Milton says in conclusion, “I believe that this is not
                    a bow for every man to shoot who counts himself a teacher, but will require
                    sinews almost equal to those which Homer gave Ulysses; yet I am persuaded that
                    it may prove much more easy in the essay than it now seems at a distance, and
                    much more illustrious if God have so decided and this age have spirit and
                    capacity enough to apprehend.” Almost while Milton was writing this treatise, he
                    might have seen an attempt to realize something of his ideal in Port Royal. What
                    a charm does this name awaken! Yet how few of us have made a pilgrimage to that
                    secluded valley! Here we find, for the first time in the modern world, the
                    highest gifts of the greatest men of a country applied to the business of
                    education. Arnauld, Lancelot, Nicole did not commence by being educational
                    philosophers. They began with a small school, and developed their method as they
                    proceeded. Their success has seldom been surpassed. But a more lasting memorial
                    than their pupils are the books which they sent out, which bear the name of
                    their cloister. The <hi rend="italic">Port</hi><hi rend="italic">Payai</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logic, General Grammar, Greek, Latin, Italian,</hi> and <hi

                    Poots</hi> which taught Greek to Gibbon, the <hi rend="italic">Port Royal
                    Geometry,</hi> and their translations of the classics held tho first place among
                    school books for more than a century. The success of the Jansenists was too much
                    for the jealousy of the Jesuits. Neither piety, nor wit, nor virtue could save
                    them. A light was quenched which would have given an entirely different
                    direction to the education of France and of Europe. No one can visit without
                    emotion that retired nook which lies hidden among the forests of Versailles,
                    where the old brick dove-cot, the pillars of the church, the trees of the desert
                    alone remain to speak to us of Pascal, Racine, and the Mère Angélique. The
                    principles of Port Royal found some supporters in a later time, in the better
                    days of French education before monarchism and militarism had crushed the life
                    out of the nation. Rollin is never mentioned without the epithet <hi
                    rend="italic">bon,</hi> a testimony to his wisdom, virtue, and simplicity.
                    Fénelon may be reckoned as belonging to the same school, but he was more fitted
                    to mix and grapple with mankind.</p>
                <p>No history of education would be complete without the name of August Hermann
                    Francke, the founder of the school of Pietists, and of a number of institutions
                    which now form almost a suburb in the town of Halle to which his labours were
                    devoted. The first scenes of his activity were Leipzig and Dresden; but in 1692,
                    at the age of 29, he was made pastor of Glaucha near Halle, and professor in the
                    newly established university. Three years later he commenced his poor school
                    with a capital of seven guelders which he found in the poor box of his house. At
                    his death in 1727 he left behind him the following institutions :—a paedagogium,
                    or training college, with 82 scholars and 70 teachers receiving education, and
                    attendants; the Latin school of the orphan asylum, with 3 inspectors, 32
                    teachers, 400 scholars, and 10 servants; the German town schools, with 4
                    inspectors, 98 teachers, 8 female teachers, and 1725 boys and girls. The
                    establishment for orphan children contained 100 boys, 34 girls, and 10
                    attendants. A cheap public dining table was attended by 255 students and 360
                    poor scholars, and besides this there was an apothecary’s and a bookseller’s
                    shop. Francke’s principles of education were strictly religious. Hebrew was
                    included in his curriculum, but the heathen classicswere treated with slight
                    respect. The <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> of Macarius were read in the place
                    of Thucydides. As might be expected, the rules laid down for discipline and
                    moral training breathed a spirit of deep affection and sympathy. Francke’s great
                    merit, however, is to have left us a model of institutions by which children of
                    all ranks may receive an education to fit them for any position in life. The
                    Franckesche Stiftungen are still, next to the university, the centre of the
                    intellectual life of Halle, and the different schools which they contain give
                    instruction to 3500 children.</p>
                <p>We now come to the book which has had more influence than any other on the
                    education of later times. The <hi rend="italic">Emile</hi> of Rousseau was
                    published in 1762. It produced an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0697-0676"/> astounding effect throughout Europe. Those were
                    days when the whole cultivated world vibrated to any touch of new philosophy.
                    French had superseded Latin as the general medium of thought. French learning
                    stood in the same relation to the rest of Europe as German learning does now;
                    and any discovery of D’Alembert, Rousseau, or Maupertuis travelled with
                    inconceivable speed from Versailles to Schönbrunn, from the Spree to the Neva.
                    Kant in his distant home of Königsberg broke for one day through his habits,
                    more regular than the town clock, and stayed at home to study the new
                    revelation. The burthen of Rousseau’s message was nature, such a nature as never
                    did and never will exist, but still a name for an ideal worthy of our struggles.
                    He revolted against the false civilization which he saw around him; he was
                    penetrated with sorrow at the shams of government and society, at the misery of
                    the poor existing side by side with the heartlessness of the rich. The child
                    should· be the pupil of nature. He lays great stress on the earliest education.
                    The first year of life is in every respect the most important. Nature must be
                    closely followed. The child’s tears are petitions which should be granted. The
                    naughtiness of children comes from weakness; make the child strong and he will
                    be good. Children’s destructiveness is a form of activity. Do not be too anxious
                    to make children talk; be satisfied with a small vocabulary. Lay aside all
                    padded caps and baby jumpers. Let children learn to walk by learning that it
                    hurts them to fall. Do not insist too much on the duty of obedience as on the
                    necessity of submission to natural laws. Do not argue too much with children;
                    educate the heart to wish for right actions; before all things study nature. The
                    chief moral principle is <hi rend="italic">do no one harm.</hi> Emile is to be
                    taught by the real things of life, by observation and experience. At twelve
                    years old he is scarcely to know what a book is; to be able to read and write at
                    fifteen is quite enough. We must first make him a man, and that chiefly by
                    athletic exercises. Educate his sight to measure, count, and weigh accurately;
                    teach him to draw; tune his ear to time and harmony; give him simple food, but
                    let him eat as much as he likes. Thus at twelve years old Emile is a real child
                    of nature. His carriage and bearing are fair and confident, his nature open and
                    candid, his speech simple and to the point; his ideas are few but clear; he
                    knows nothing by learning, much by experience. He has read deeply in the book of
                    nature. His mind is not on his tongue but in his head. He speaks only one
                    language, but knows what he is saying, and can do what he cannot describe.
                    Routine and custom are unknown to him; authority and example affect him not; he
                    does what he thinks right. He understands nothing of duty and obedience, but he
                    will do what you ask him, and will expect a similar service of you in return.
                    His strength and body are fully developed; he is first-rate at running, jumping,
                    and judging distances. Should he die at this age lie will so far have lived his
                    life. From twelve to fifteen Emile’s practical education is to continue. He is
                    still to avoid books which teach not learning itself but to appear learned. He
                    is to be taught and to practice some handicraft. Half the value of education is
                    to waste time wisely, to tide over dangerous years with safety, until the
                    character is better able to stand temptation. At fifteen a new epoch commences.
                    The passions are awakened; the care of the teacher should now redouble; he
                    should never leave the helm. Émile having gradually acquired the love of himself
                    and of those immediately about him, will begin to love his kind. Now is the time
                    to teach him history, and the machinery of society, the world as it is and as it
                    might be. Still an encumbrance of useless and burdensome knowledge is to be
                    avoided. Between this age and manhood Émile learns all that it is necessary for
                    him to know. It is, perhaps, strange that a book in many respects so wild and
                    fantastic should have produced so great a practical effect. In pursuance of its
                    precepts, children went about naked, were not allowed to read, and when they
                    grew up wore the simplest clothes, and cared for little learning except the
                    study of nature and Plutarch. The catastrophe of the French Revolution has made
                    the importance of Emile less apparent to us. Much of the heroism of that time is
                    doubtless due to the exaltation produced by the sweeping away of abuses, and the
                    approach of a brighter age. But we must not forget that the first generation of
                    Émile was just thirty years old in 1792; that many of the Girondins, the
                    Marseillais, the soldiers and generals of Carnot and Napoleon had been bred in
                    that hardy school. There is no more interesting chapter in the history of
                    education than the tracing back of epochs of special activity to the obscure
                    source from which they arose. Thus the Whigs of the Reform Bill sprang from the
                    wits of Edinburgh, the heroes of the Rebellion from the divines who translated
                    the Bible, the martyrs of the Revolution from the philosophers of the
                    Encyclopaedia.</p>
                <p>The teaching of Rousseau found its practical expression in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >philanthropic</hi> of Dessau, a school founded by Basedow, the friend of Goethe
                    and Lavater, one of the two prophets between whom the world-child sat bodkin in
                    that memorable post-chaise journey of which Goethe has left us an account. The
                    principles of the teaching given in this establishment were very much those of
                    Oomenius, the combination of words and things. An amusing account of the
                    instruction given in this school, which at this time consisted of only thirteen
                    pupils, has come down to us, a translation of which is given in the excellent
                    work of Mr Quick on educational reformers. The little ones have gone through the
                    oddest performances. They play at “word of command.” Eight or ten stand in a
                    line like soldiers, and Herr Wolke is officer. He gives the word in Latin, and
                    they must do whatever he says. For instance when he says “claudite oculos,” they
                    all shut their eyes; when he says “circumspicite,” they look about them;
                    “imitamini sutorem,” they draw the waxed thread like cobblers. Herr Wolke gives
                    a thousand different commands in the drollest fashion. Another game, “the hiding
                    game,” may also be described. Some one writes a name and hides it from the
                    children, the name of some part of the body, or of a plant or animal, or metal,
                    and the children guess what it is. Whoever guesses right gets an apple or a
                    piece of cake; one of the visitors wrote “intestina,” and told the children it
                    was part of the body. Then the guessing began, one guessed caput, another nasus,
                    another os, another manus, pes, digiti, pectus, and so forth for a long time,
                    but one of them hits it at last. Next Herr Wolke wrote the name of a beast or
                    quadruped, then came the guesses, leo, ursus, camelus, elephas, and so on, till
                    one guessed right it was mus. Then a town was written, and they guessed Lisbon,
                    Madrid, Paris, London, till a child won with St Petersburg. They had another
                    game which was this. Herr Wolke gave the command in Latin, and they imitated the
                    noises of different animals, and made the visitors laugh till they were tired.
                    They roared like lions, crowed like cocks, mewed like cats, just as they were
                    bid. Yet Kant found a great deal to praise in this school, and spoke of its
                    influence as one of the best hopes of the future, and as “the only school where
                    the teachers had liberty to act according to their own methods and schemes, and
                    where they were in free communication both among themselves and with all learned
                    men throughout Germany.”</p>
                <p>A more successful labourer in the same school was Salzmann, who bought the
                    property of Schnepfenthal near Gotha in 1784, and established a school there,
                    which still exists as a flourishing institution. He gave full scope to <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0698-0677"/> the doctrines of the philanthropists; the limits
                    of learning were enlarged; study became a pleasure instead of a pain, scope was
                    given for healthy exercise; the school became light, airy, aud cheerful. A
                    charge of superficiality and weakness was brought against this method of
                    instruction; but the gratitude which our generation of teachers owes to the
                    unbounded love and faith of these devoted men cannot be denied or refused. The
                    end of the 18th century saw a great development given to classical studies. The
                    names of Cellarius, Gesner, Ernesti, and Heyne are perhaps more cele-bratedas
                    scholarsthan asschoolmasters. To them we owe the great importance attached to
                    the study of the classics, both on the Continent and in England. They brought
                    into the schools the philology which F. A. Wolf had organized for the
                    universities. Pestalozzi, on the other hand, was completely and entirely devoted
                    to education. His greatest merit is that he set an example of absolute
                    self-abnegation, that he lived with his pupils, played, starved, and suffered
                    with them, and clung to their minds and hearts withan affectionate sympathy
                    which revealed to him every minute difference of character and disposition.
                    Pestalozzi -was born at Zurich in 1746. His father died when he was young, and
                    he was brought up by his mother. His earliest years were spent in schemes for
                    improving the condition of the people. The death of his friend Bluntschli turned
                    him from political schemes, aud induced him to devote himself to education. He
                    married at 23, and bought a piece of waste land in Aargau, where he attempted
                    the cultivation of madder. Pestalozzi knew nothing of business, and the plan
                    failed. Before this he had opened his farm-house as a school; but in 1780 he had
                    to give this up also. His first book published at this time was <hi
                    rend="italic">The Evening Hours of a Hermit,</hi> a series of aphorisms and
                    reflections. This was followed by his masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Leonard and
                    Gertrude,</hi> an account of the gradual reformation, first of a household, and
                    then of a whole village, by the efforts of a good and devoted woman. It was read
                    with avidity in Germany, and the name of Pestalozzi was rescued from obscurity.
                    His attempts to follow up this first literary success were failures. The French
                    invasion of Switzerland in 1798 brought into relief his truly heroic character.
                    A number of children were left in Canton Unterwalden on the shores of the Lake
                    of Lucerne, without parents, home, food, or shelter. Pestalozzi collected a
                    number of them into a deserted convent, and spent his energies in reclaiming
                    them. “I was,” he says, “from morning till evening, almost alone in their midst.
                    Everything which was done for their body or soul proceeded from my hand. Every
                    assistance, every help in time of need, every teaching which they received came
                    immediately from me. My hand lay in their hand, my eye rested on their eye, my
                    tears flowed with theirs, and my laughter accompanied theirs. They were out of
                    the world, they were out of Stanz; they were with me, and I was with them. Their
                    soup was mine, their drink was mine. I had nothing, I had no housekeeping, no
                    friend, no servants around me; I had them alone. Were they well I stood in their
                    midst; were they ill, I was at their side. I slept in the middle of them. I was
                    the last who went to bed at night, the first who rose in the morning. Even in
                    bed I prayed and taught with them until they were asleep,—they wished it to be
                    so.” Thus he passed the winter, but in June 1799 the building was required by
                    the French for a hospital, aud the children were dispersed. We have dwelt
                    especially on this episode of Pestalozzi’s life, because in this devotion lay
                    his strength. In 1801 he gave an exposition of his ideas on education in the
                    book <hi rend="italic">How Gertrude teaches her Children.</hi> His method is to
                    proceed from the easier to the more difficult. To begin with observation, to
                    pass from observation to consciousness, from consciousness to speech. Then come
                    measuring, drawing, writing, numbers, and so reckoning. In 1799 he had been
                    enabled to establish a school at Burgdorf, where he remained till 1804. In 1802,
                    he went as deputy to Paris, and did his best to interest Napoleon in a scheme of
                    national education; but the great conqueror said that he could not trouble
                    himself about the alphabet. In 1805 he removed to Yverdun on the Lake of
                    Neufchatel, and for twenty years worked steadily at his task. He was visited by
                    all who took interest in education,—Talleyrand, Capo d’Istria, and Madame de
                    Stael. He was praised by Wilhelm von Humboldt and by Fichte. His pupils included
                    Ramsauer, Delbrück, Blochmann, Carl Ritter, Fröbel, and Zeller. About 1815
                    dissensions broke out among the teachers of the school, and Pestalozzi’s last
                    ten years were chequered by weariness and sorrow. In 1825 he retired to Neuhof,
                    the home of his youth; and after waiting the adventures of his life, and his
                    last work, the <hi rend="italic">Swan</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Song,</hi> he
                    died in 1827. As he said himself, the real work of his life did not lie in
                    Burgdorf or in Yverdun, the products rather of his weakness than of his
                    strength. It lay in the principles of education which he practised, the
                    development of his observation, the training of the whole man, the sympathetic
                    application of the teacher to the taught, of which he left an example in his six
                    months’ labours at Stanz. He shewed what truth there was in the principles of
                    Comenius and Rousseau, in the union of training with information, and the
                    submissive following of nature; he has had the deepest effect on all branches of
                    education sincp his time, and his influence is far from being exhausted.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Émile</hi> of Rousseau was the point of departure for an
                    awakened interest in educational theories which has continued unto the present
                    day. Few thinkers of eminence during the last hundred years have failed to offer
                    their contributions more or less directly on this subject. Poets like Richter,
                    Herder, and Goethe, philosophers such as Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Schleiermacher,
                    and Schopenhauer, psychologists such as Herbart and Beneke, have left directions
                    for our guidance. Indeed, during this time the science of education or
                    paedagogics, as the Germans call it, may have been said to have come into
                    existence. It has attracted but little attention in England; but it is an
                    important subject of study at all German universities, and we may hope that the
                    example given by the establishment of chairs of education in the Scotch
                    universities may soon be followed by the other great centres of instruction in
                    Great Britain. Jean Paul called his book <hi rend="italic">Levana,</hi> after
                    the Roman goddess to whom the father dedicated his new-born child, in token that
                    he intended to rear it to manhood. He lays great stress on the preservation of
                    individuality of character, a merit which he possessed himself in so high a
                    degree. The second part of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> is in the main
                    a treatise upon education. The essays of Carlyle have made us familiar with the
                    mysteries of the paedagogic province, the solemn gestures of the three
                    reverences, the long cloisters which contain the history of God’s dealings with
                    the human race. The most characteristic passage is that which describes the
                    father’s return to the country of education after a year’s absence. As he is
                    riding alone, wondering in what guise he w ill meet his son, a multitude of
                    horses rush by at full gallop. “The monstrous hurly-burly whirls past the
                    wanderer; a fair boy among the keepers looks at him with surprise, pulls in,
                    leaps down, and embraces his father.” He then learns that an agricultural life
                    had not suited his son, that the superiors had discovered that he was fond of
                    animals, and had set him to that occupation for which nature had destined
                    him.</p>
                <p>The system of Jacotot has aroused great interest in this country. Its author was
                    born at Dijon in 1770. In, 1815 lie retired to Louvain and became professor
                    there, and director of the Belgian military school. He died in 1840. His method
                    of teaching is based on three principles :—</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n699/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0699-0678"/>
                <p>1. All men have an equal intelligence;</p>
                <p>2. Every man has received from God the faculty of being able to instruct
                    himself;</p>
                <p>3. Every thing is in every thing.</p>
                <p>The first of these principles is certainly wrong, although Jacotot tried to
                    explain it by asserting that, although men had the same intelligence, they
                    differed widely in the will to make use of it. Still it is important to assert
                    that nearly all men are capable of receiving some intellectual education,
                    provided the studies to which they are directed are wide enough to engage their
                    faculties, and the means taken to interest them are sufficiently ingenious. The
                    second principle lays down that it is more necessary to stimulate the pupil to
                    learn for himself, than to teach him didactically. The third principle explains
                    the process which Jacotot adopted. To one learning a language for the first time
                    he would give a short passage of a few lines, and encourage the pupil to study
                    first the words, then the letters, then the grammar, then the full meaning of
                    the expressions, until by iteration and accretion a single paragraph took the
                    place of an entire literature. Much may be effected by this method in the hands
                    of a skilful teacher, but a charlatan might make it an excuse for ignorance and
                    neglect.</p>
                <p>Among those who have improved the methods of teaching, we must mention Bell and
                    Lancaster, the jointdiscoverers of the method of mutual instruction, which, if
                    it has not effected everything which its founders expected of it, has produced
                    the system of pupil-teachers which is common in our schools. Froebel also
                    deserves an honourable place as the founder of the Kindergarten, a means of
                    teaching young children by playing and amusement. His plans, which have a far
                    wider significance than this limited development of them, are likely to be
                    fruitful of results to future workers.</p>
                <p>The last English writers on education are Mr Herbert Spencer and Mr Alexander
                    Bain, the study of whose writings will land us in those regions of paedagogics
                    which have been most recently explored. We need not follow Mr Spencer into his
                    defence of science as the worthiest object of study, or in his rules for moral
                    and physical training, except to say that they are sound and practical. In
                    writing of intellectual education, he insists that we shall attain the best
                    results by closely studying the development of the mind, and availing ourselves
                    of the whole amount of force which nature puts at our disposal. The mind of
                    every being is naturally active and vigorous, indeed it is never at rest. But
                    for its healthy growth it must have something to work upon, and, therefore, the
                    teacher must watch its movements with the most sympathetic care, in order to
                    supply exactly that food which it requires at any particular time. In this way a
                    much larger cycle of attainments can be compassed than by the adoption of any
                    programme or curriculum, however carefully drawn up. It is no good to teach what
                    is not remembered; the strength of memory depends on attention, and attention
                    depends upon interest. To teach without interest is to work like Sisyphus and
                    the Danaides. Arouse interest if you can, rather by high means than by low
                    means. But it is a saving of power to make use of interest which you have
                    already existing, and which, unless dried up or distorted by injudicious
                    violence, will naturally lead the mind into all the knowledge which it is
                    capable of receiving. Therefore, never from the first force a child’s attention;
                    leave off a study the moment it becomes wearisome, never let a child do what it
                    does not like, only take care that when its liking is in activity a choice of
                    good as well as evil shall be given to it.</p>
                <p>Mr Bain’s writings on education, which are contained in some articles in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fortnightly Review,</hi> and in two articles in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mind</hi> (Nos. v. and vii.) are extremely valuable. Perhaps the most
                    interesting part of them consists in his showing how what may be called the
                    “correlation of forces in man” helps us to a right education. From this we learn
                    that emotion may be transformed into intellect, that sensation may exhaust the
                    brain as much as thought, and we may infer that the chief duty of a schoolmaster
                    is to stimulate the powers of each brain under his charge to the fullest
                    activity, and to apportion them in that ratio which will best conduce to the
                    most complete and harmonious development of the individual.</p>
                <p>It seems to follow from this sketch of the history of education that, in spite of
                    the great advances which have been made of late years, the science of education
                    is still far in advance of the art. Schoolmasters are still spending their best
                    energies in teaching subjects which have been universally condemned by
                    educational reformers for the last two hundred years. The education of every
                    public school is a farrago of rules, principles, and customs derived from every
                    age of teaching, from the most modern to the most remote. It is plain that the
                    science and art of teaching will never be established on a firm basis until it
                    is organized on the model of the sister art of medicine. We must pursue the
                    patient methods of induction by which other sciences have reached the stature of
                    maturity; we must discover some means of registering and tabulating results; we
                    must invent a phraseology and nomenclature which will enable results to be
                    accurately recorded; we must place education in its proper position among the
                    sciences of observation. A philosopher who should succeed in doing this would be
                    venerated by future ages as the creator of the art of teaching.</p>
                <p>It only remains now to give some account of the very large literature of the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The history of education was not investigated till the beginning of the present
                    century, and since then little original research has been made except by
                    Germans. Whilst acknowledging our great obligations to the German historians, we
                    cannot but regret that all the investigations have belonged to the same nation.
                    For instance, one of the best treatises on education written in the 16th century
                    is Mulcaster’s <hi rend="italic">Positions,</hi> which has never been reprinted,
                    and is now a literary curiosity.</p>
                <p>Mangelsdorf and Ruhkopf attempted histories of education at the end of the last
                    century, but the first work of note was F. H.Ch. Schwarz’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">d.</hi><hi rend="italic">Erziehung</hi>
                    (1813). A. H. Niemeyer, a very influential writer, was one of the first to
                    insist on the importance of making use of all that has been handed down to us,
                    and with this practical object in view he has given us an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ueberblick</hi><hi rend="italic">der allgemeinen Geschichte der Erziehung.</hi>
                    Other writers followed; but from the time of its appearance till within the last
                    few years, by far the most readable and the most read work on the history of
                    education was that of Karl von Raumer. Raumer, however, is too chatty and too
                    religious to pass for “wissenschaftlich,” and the standard history is now that
                    of Karl Schmidt. The Roman Catholics have not been content to adopt the works of
                    Protestants, but have histories of their own. These are the very pleasing
                    sketches of L. Kellner and the somewhat larger history by Stoeckl. When we come
                    to writers who have produced sketches or shorter histories, we find the list in
                    Germany a very long one. Among the best books of this kind are Fried. Dittes’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi> and Dröse’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pädagogische</hi><hi rend="italic">Characterbilder.</hi> An account of this
                    literature will be found in J. Chr. G. Schumann’s paper among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pädagogische Studien,</hi> edited by Dr Reiss. For biographies the
                    paedagogic cyclopaedias may be consulted, of which the first is the <hi

                    >Erziehungswesens</hi> of K. A. Schmid, a great work in 11 or 12 vols, not yet
                    completed, rlthough the second edition of the early vols.</p>

                <p>is already announced. The Roman Catholics have also begun a large encyclopaedia
                    edited by Rolfus and Pfister. No similar work has been published in France, but
                    a <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia of Education</hi> in one volume has lately been
                    issued at New York (Steiger,—the editors are Kiddle and Scherr), and in this
                    there are articles by English as well as American writers. In French the <hi

                    rend="italic">T Education,</hi> by Th. Fritz (Strasburg, 1841),. has a sketch of
                    the history, which as a sketch is worth notice. Jules Paroz has written a useful
                    little <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi> which would have been more valuable if it
                    had been longer.</p>
                <p>In English, though we have no investigators of the history of education we have a
                    fairly large literature on the subject, but it belongs almost exclusively to the
                    United States. The great work of Henry Barnard, the <hi rend="italic">American
                    Journal of Education,</hi> in 25 vols., has valuable papeιs on almost every part
                    of our subject, many of them translated from the German, but there are also
                    original papers on our old English educational writers and extracts from their
                    works. This is by far the most valuable work in our language on the history of
                    education. The small volumes published in America with the title of “History of
                    Education” do not deserve notice. In England may be mentioned the article on
                    education by Mr James Mill, published in the early editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopedia Britannica,</hi> and Mr R. H. Quick’s most excellent
                    <hi rend="italic">Essays on Educational Reformers,</hi> published in 1868. Since
                    then Mr Leitch of Glasgow has issued a volume called <hi rend="italic">Practical
                    Educationists,</hi> which deals with English and Scotch reformers, as well as
                    with Comenius and Pestalozzi. Now that professorships of education have been
                    established we may hope for some original research. The first professor
                    appointed was the late Joseph Payne, a name well known to those among us who
                    have studied the theory of education. The professorship was started by the
                    College of Preceptors. At Edinburgh and at St Andrews professors have since been
                    elected by the Bell Trustees.</p>
                <p>Valuable reports as to the state of education in the various countries that
                    possess a national system were presented to the English Schools Inquiry
                    Commission in 1867 and 1868, by inspectors specially appointed to investigate
                    the subject. The reports on the Common School System of the United States and
                    Canada by the Rev. James Fraser, on the Burgh Schools in Scotland by D. R.
                    Fearon, and on Secondary Education in France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, by
                    Matthew Arnold, are included in Parliamentary Papers [3857], 1867, and [3966
                    v.], 1868.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Law Relating to Education.</hi></p>
                <p>To the foregoing historical statement may be added some account of the different
                    systems of education administered by statute in the United Kingdom :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">England.—</hi> Until quite recently there was no public
                    provision for education in England, and even now it is only the elementary
                    education of the people that can be said to be .regulated by the law. Parliament
                    has indeed taken cognizance of the institutions founded for the higher
                    education. The universities and the endowed schools have been enabled by various
                    statutes to adapt themselves more completely to the wants of the times; but they
                    still retain their character of local, and one might almost say private,
                    corporations. Their administration is subject to the control of no state
                    authority, and in districts where such institutions do not exist there is no
                    public provision for supplementing the deficiency. Elementary education, until
                    the Act of 1870, was in the same way dependent on voluntary enterprise or casual
                    endowment.</p>
                <p>The first approach to a public system of education was by means of grants in aid
                    of private schools, administered by a committee of the Privy Council. This
                    system is not superseded by the Education Act of 1870, but means are taken to
                    ensure the existence in every school district of a “sufficient amount of
                    accommodation in public elementary schools.” The school district is the borough
                    or parish, except in the case of London and Oxford. When the amount of school
                    accommodation in a district is insufficient, and the deficiency is not supplied
                    as required by the Act, a school board shall be formed and shall supply such
                    deficiency. Every elementary school is a public school in the sense of the Act
                    if it is conducted according to the regulations in section 7, which in substance
                    are :—</p>
                <p>1. It shall not be required, as a condition of any child being admitted into, or
                    continuing in the school, that he shall attend or abstain from attending any
                    Sunday school, or any place of religious worship, or that he shall attend any
                    religious observance or any instruction in religious subjects, in the school or
                    elsewhere, from which observance or instruction he may be withdrawn by his
                    parents, or that he shall, if withdrawn by his parents, attend the school on any
                    day set apart for religious observance by the religious body to which h’s parent
                    belongs.</p>
                <p>2. Time for religious observance or instruction in the school must be at the
                    beginning or end of school meeting, and must be shewn in a time table
                    conspicuously posted in the school.</p>
                <p>3. School must be open to inspection, except that the inspector is not to inquire
                    into religious knowledge.</p>
                <p>4. School must be conducted in accordance with the conditions required to obtain
                    a parliamentary grant.</p>
                <p>When the Education Department are satisfied after inquiry that the supply of
                    public elementary schools as thus defined is in any district insufficient, they
                    may cause a school board to be formed, as they may also (1) when application is
                    made to th em-to that effect by the persons who would be the electors if there
                    were a school board (in a borough by council), and (2) when they are satisfied
                    that the managers of an elementary school are unwilling or unable to maintain
                    it, and by its discontinuance the supply for the district will become
                    insufficient. The body of the Act describes the constitution, powers, duties,
                    and revenues of school boards, as in the following brief summary :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> The school board is a corporation with
                    perpetual succession and common seal, and power to hold land without licence in
                    mortmain. It is elected by the burgesses in a borough, aud by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n701/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0701-0680"/> the ratepayers in a parish, each voter having a
                    number of rotes equal to the number of vacancies, having the right to give all
                    or any numbeι∙ of such votes to any one candidate, and to distribute them as he
                    pleases. The number of members varies from 5 to 15 as may be determined. The
                    London school board is elected under special regulations.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bowers and Duties. —</hi> Every school board, for the
                    purpose of providing sufficiant public school accommodation for their district,
                    may provide or improve schoolhouses and supply school apparatus &amp;c., and
                    purchase or take on lease any land or any right over land. Sect. 20 contains
                    regulations under which the compulsory purchase of sites may be made. The
                    schools provided by the board must comply with the following conditions (1 )
                    They must be public elementary schools, in the sense defined above; (2) No
                    religious catechism or religious formulary, which is distinctive of° any
                    particular denomination, shall be taught in the schools. The board may delegate
                    their powers (except that of raising money) to managers. Any breach of these
                    regulations may subject the board to being declared in default by the Education
                    Department, who will thereupon nominate a new board. The fees of children
                    attending board schools are to be fixed by the board, with the consent of the
                    Department, but the board may remit fees on account of poverty for a renewable
                    period not exceeding six months, and it is expressly declared that “such
                    remission shall not be deemed to be parochial relief” given to the parent.
                    Further, free schools may be established where the Education Department are
                    satisfied that the poverty of the inhabitants is such as to render them
                    necessary. Section 25 enables the board to pay the fees of poor children
                    attending any public elementary school, but “no such payment shall be made or
                    refused on condition of the child attending any public elementary school other
                    than such as may be selected by the parent (sic), and such payment shall not be
                    deemed to be parochial relief.” This clause, which excited a vast amount of
                    opposition in Parliament, was repealed by 39 and 40 Vict. c. 59 (see <hi
                    rend="italic">infra).</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Revenues.—</hi> The expenses of the board are to be paid
                    from a fund called the school fund, constituted primarily by the fees of the
                    children, moneys provided by Parliament, or raised by loan, or received in any
                    other way, and supplemented by the rates, to be levied by the rating authority.
                    In providing buildings, &amp;c., the board may borrow money so as to spread the
                    payment over several years, not exceeding fifty. (See, as to this power,
                    Elementary Education Act 1873, § 10.)</p>
                <p>School boards may by a bye-law require the parents of all children between five
                    and thirteen to send them to school, and it is a reasonable excuse (1) that the
                    child is receiving efficient instruction in some other manner, or (2) is
                    prevented by sickness, or (3) that that there is no public elementary school
                    within such distance not exceeding three miles as the bye-laws may prescribe.
                    Breaches of any such bye-law may be recovered in a summary manner, but the
                    penalty shall not exceed five shillings including costs.</p>
                <p>Finally, it is provided that in future no parliamentary grant shall be made to
                    any school which does not come within the definition of “public elementary
                    school in the Act.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Elementary school” is defined to be one in which elementary education is
                    the principal part of the education there given, and at which the fees do not
                    exceed ninepence per week.</p></note> Such grant shall not be made in respect of
                    religious instruction, and shall not exceed in any case the income of the school
                    from other sources. No connexion with a religious denomination is necessary, and
                    no preference is to be given to a school on account of its being or not being a
                    board school. Otherwise the minutes of the Committee of Council govern the
                    adminstration of the grant, such minutes to lie one month on the table of both
                    Houses of Parliament before coming into force.</p>
                <p>The Elementary Education Act, 1873, amends the Act of 1870 in several particulars
                    nor necessary to be specified here.</p>
                <p>The Elementary Education Act, 1876, which came into operation on the 1st January
                    1877, declares that it shall be the duty of the parent of every child (meaning
                    thereby a child between the ages of five and fourteen) to cause such child to
                    receive efficient elementary instruction in reading, writing, and
                    arithmetic,—the duty to be enforced by the orders and penalties specified in the
                    Act. The employment of children under the age of ten, oι over that age without a
                    certificate of proficiency or of previous due attendance at a certified
                    efficient school, is prohibited unless the child is attending school in
                    accordance with the Factory Acts, or by bye-law under the Education Acts.
                    Section 10 substitutes for section 25 of the Act of 1872 the following :—</p>
                <p>“The parent, not being a pauper, of any child, who is unable by reason of poverty
                    to pay the ordinary fee for such child at a public elementary school, or any
                    part of such fee, may apply to the guardians having jurisdiction in the parish
                    in which he resides; and it shall be the duty of such guardians, if satisfied of
                    such inability, to pay the sajd fee, not exceeding threepence per week, or such
                    part thereof as he is, in the opinion of the guardiaiîs, so unable to pay.”</p>
                <p>This payment subjects the parent to no disqualification or disability, and he is
                    entitled to select the school. The following new regulations are made as to the
                    parliamentary grant. A child obtaining before the age of eleven a certificate of
                    proficiency and of due attendance, as in the Act mentioned, may have his school
                    fees for the next three years paid for him by the Education. Department—such
                    school fees to be calculated as school-pence. The grant is no longer to be
                    reduced by its excess above the income of the school, unless it exceeds 17s. 6d.
                    per child in average attendance, but shall Dot exceed that amount except by the
                    same sum by which the income of the school, other than the grant, exceeds it.
                    Special grants may be made to places in which the population is small. Other
                    clauses relate to industrial schools, administrative provisions, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> Previous to the Education (Scotland) Act of
                    1872, the public elementary education rested on the old parochial system,
                    supplemented in more recent times by the parliamentary grants from the Committee
                    of Council on Education. Under the old law the heritors in every parish were
                    bound to provide a schoolhouse, and to contribute the schoolmaster’s salary,
                    half of which, however, was legally chargeable on tenants.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The following are the Acts relating to
                    education in Scotland recited in the Education Act of 1872 :—Act of Scots
                    Parliament, 1696 (1st of King William); 43 Geo. III. c. 51; 1 and 2 Vict. c. 87,
                    and 24 and 25 Vict. c. 107.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Education Act of 1872 establishes for a limited number of years a Board of
                    Education for Scotland, to be responsible to the Scotch Education Department of
                    the Privy Council, on which its functions are ultimately to devolve. The board
                    makes an annual report to the department.</p>
                <p>A school board must be elected in every parish and burgh as defined in the Act.
                    The number of members (between five and fifteen) is fixed by the Board of
                    Education, and no teacher in a public school is eligible. The election is by
                    cumulative vote, and disputed elections are to be settled by the sheriff. The
                    school board is a body corporate. Existing parish, burgh, and other schools,
                    established under former Acts, are to be handed over to the school board.</p>
                <p>The school board, acting under the Board of Education, shall provide a sufficient
                    supply of school accommodation, and in determining what additional amount is
                    necessary, existing efficient schools are to be taken into account, whether
                    public or not. Provision is made for the transference of existing schools to the
                    school board.</p>
                <p>The clauses as to the school fund, and the power of the board to impose rates and
                    to borrow money, are similar to those in the English Acts, and it is declared
                    that sunk funds for behoof of burgh or parish schools shall be administered by
                    the board, and that the board shall be at liberty to receive any property or
                    funds to be employed in promoting education. Schoolmasters in office at the
                    passing of the Act are not to be prejudiced in any of their rights, but all
                    future appointments shall be during the pleasure of the board, who shall assign
                    such salaries and emoluments as they think fit.</p>
                <p>Sections 56-59 relate to the qualifications of teachers. A principal teacher in a
                    public school must possess a certificate of competency or an equivalent as
                    defined in the Act.</p>
                <p>Section 62 contains provisions for the maintenance by the school board of higher
                    class public schools in burghs, which are as far as practicable to be released
                    from the necessity of giving elementary instruction, so that the funds may be
                    applied more exclusively to the instruction on the higher branches. And when by
                    reason of an endowment or otherwise a parish school is in a condition to give
                    instruction in the higher branches, it maybe deemed to be a higher class school
                    and managed accordingly.</p>

                <p>Parliamentary grants are to he made (1). to school boards, (2) to the managers of
                    any school which is efficiently contributing to secular education. No grant
                    shall be made, in respect of (1) religious instruction, (2) new schools, not
                    being public schools, unless it appears that they are required, regard being had
                    to the religious belief of the parents of the children for whom they are
                    intended, or other special circumstances of the locality. Section 68 is the
                    conscience clause, and it may be mentioned that the preamble of the Act states
                    that it is expedient that managers of public schools should be at liberty to
                    continue the custom of giving <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> instruction in
                    religion to children whose parents did not object, with liberty to parents,
                    without forfeiting any of the other advantages of the schools, to elect that
                    their childιen should not receive such instruction.” Section 69 imposes on
                    parents the duty of providing elementary instruction for children between live
                    and thirteen, and the parochial board shall ρay the fee for poor parents.
                    Defaulters may be prosecuted; and persons receiving children into their houses
                    or workshops shall be deemed to have undertaken the duties of parents with
                    reference to the education of children. A certificate of the child’s proficiency
                    by an inspector protects the parent or employer from proceedings under the Act.
                    Other clauses relate to the non-educational duties imposed by various Acts on
                    schoolmasters (now transferred to registrars), and to the “Schoolmasters’
                    Widows’ Fund,” to which new masters are not required to contribute.</p>
                <p>The Education Board, continued by Order in Council to 6th August 1877, has been
                    further continued by statute to 6th August 1878.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> The public elementary school system depends on
                    grants made to the lord-lieutenant, to be expended under the direction of
                    commissioners nominated by the Crown, and named “The Commissioners of National
                    Education.” The commissioners were incorporated by this name in 1845, with power
                    to hold land to the yearly value of £40,000. The following statement, taken from
                    the rules and regulations of the commissioners appended to their report for
                    1873, exhibits the leading points of the system as contrasted with that now
                    established in England and Scotland.</p>
                <p>“The object of the system of national education is to afford combined literary
                    and moral and separate religious instruction to children of all persuasions, as
                    far as possible in the same school, upon the fundamental principle that no
                    attempt shall be made to interfere with the peculiar religious tenets of any
                    description of Christian pupils. It is an earnest wish of Her Majesty’s
                    Government and of the commissioners that the clergy and laity of the different
                    religious denominations should co-operate in conducting national schools.”</p>
                <p>The commissioners grant aid either to vested schools (f.e., schools vested in
                    themselves, or in local trustees to be maintained by them as national schools)
                    or to non-vested <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> private schools), and the grant
                    may be towards payment of salary or supply of books, or, in the case of vested
                    schools, towards providing buildings.</p>
                <p>The local government of the national schools is vested in the local patrons or
                    managers thereof, and the local patron is the person who applies in the first
                    instance to place the school in connection with the board, unless otherwise
                    specified. The patron may manage the school by himself or by a deputy. If the
                    school is controlled by a committee or vested in trustees, they are the patrons.
                    A patron may nominate his successor, and in case of death, his legal
                    representative if he was a layman, and his successor in office if he was a
                    clerical patron, will be recognized by the commissioners. The local patrons have
                    the power of appointing and removing teachers, subject to a rule requiring three
                    months’ notice to the teacher. Every national school must be visited three times
                    a year by inspectors.</p>
                <p>In non-vested schools, the commissioners do not in general make any conditions as
                    to the use of the building after school hours; but no national school house
                    shall be employed at any time, even temporarily, as the stated place of divine
                    worship of any religious community, and no grant will be made to a school held
                    in a place of worship. In all national schools there must be secular instruction
                    four hours a day upon five days in the week. Religious instruction must be so
                    arranged that each school shall be open to the children of all communions, that
                    due regard be had to parental right and authority, and that accordingly no child
                    shall receive or be present at any religious instruction of which his parents or
                    guardians disapprove. In non-vested schools it is for the patrons and local
                    managers to determine whether any and what religious instruction shall be given.
                    In all national schools, the patrons have the right to permit the Scriptures to
                    be read; and in all vested schools they must afford opportunities for the same,
                    if the parents or guardians require it. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
