                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0703-0682"/> her husband and family took refuge in Normandy;
                    and Edward, notwithstanding the marriage of Emma to Canute in 1017, continued to
                    reside at the Norman court, until he was recalled to England by Hardicanute in
                    1041. Hardicanute died in 1042, and “before the king was buried, all folk chose
                    Edward to be king at London;” but partly from his own unwillingness to accept
                    the crown, and partly from the opposition of the Danes who came into England
                    with Canute, his coronation did not take place till April 1043. The chief agent
                    in overcoming his scruples, and in quelling all murmurs of opposition against
                    his election, was Godwin the West Saxon earl, whose influence was at that time
                    paramount in England. The exact nature of the relations between Godwin and
                    Edward has been the subject of considerable discussion; but the most probable
                    view of the matter is that, until after the marriage of Edward to Edgitha,
                    daughter of Godwin, in 1045, these were on the whole cordial and friendly, but
                    that gradually the king’s preference of Normans to Anglo-Saxons, his necessary
                    friendship with Leofric of Mercia and Siward of Northumbria, and his growing
                    dread of Godwin’s ambitious character, led to misunderstanding and distrust. It
                    was, probably, at the instigation of Godwin that Edward, on his accession to the
                    throne, deprived his mother Emma of her possessions, and caused her to live in
                    retirement at Winchester, and that he banished from the kingdom the chief Danish
                    partisans who opposed his election. For the first eight years his reign was
                    comparatively tranquil, the only circumstances worthy of mention being a
                    threatened invasion by Norway, the ravages committed by pirates in Kent and
                    Essex, and the outlawry of Sweyn, son of Godwin, for the seduction of the abbess
                    of Leominster. In 1051, Eustace, count of Boulogne, in endeavouring to quarter
                    his followers on the town of Dover, was resisted by the burghers, and a quarrel
                    ensuing, several Normans were slain. The king, on hearing Eustace’s account of
                    the affair, without further inquiry, commanded Godwin to chastise the town by
                    military execution. Godwin demanded a trial; but the king, incited it is said by
                    Robert, archbishop of Canterbury, summoned a meeting of the Witan at Gloucester,
                    not for the purpose of inquiring into the affair at Dover, but to pass judgment
                    on Godwin for his contumacy. Ultimately, Godwin thought it prudent to leave the
                    country and take refuge in Flanders. It was during his absence that William,
                    duke of Normandy, visited England; and if this prince did not then receive the
                    promise of the crown from Edward, his ambition to possess it and his hopes of
                    success were doubtless confirmed by his visit. There seems to have been general
                    regret at Godwin’s absence; and encouraged by the assurances he received from
                    England, he gathered a fleet, and uniting with Harold, appeared before London.
                    The king endeavoured to oppose him, but was obliged to yield to the wishes of
                    his subjects, and Godwin and his sons were reinstated in their possessions. When
                    her father left England, Edgitha had been deprived of her property and sent to
                    the royal abbey of Wherwell, but on his return she was restored to her former
                    position. Godwin died in 1053, and after his death Harold attained to great
                    influence, and virtually ruled the kingdom in the name of Edward. Towards the
                    end of 1065 Edward’s health began rapidly to fail. He had rebuilt the ancient
                    abbey of Westminster, and his only wish was to be present at its consecration,
                    which was to take place on the 28th December, but over-exertion on some previous
                    festival days was too much for his remaining strength. His share in the ceremony
                    had to be performed by deputy, and he died 5th January 1066. It was his last
                    wish that Harold should succeed him on the throne. The virtues of Edward, it has
                    been said, were monastic rather than kingly. His aims were just and righteous,
                    and he showed his interest in his subjects by the preparation of a digest of the
                    laws of the kingdom, and by the repeal of the Danegeld, or war tax; but his weak
                    character and his feeble interest in worldly matters caused the real government
                    of the kingdom during his reign to be placed almost entirely in the hands of
                    favourites.</p>
