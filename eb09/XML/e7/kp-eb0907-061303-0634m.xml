                    the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring, to whom the fourth month, answering to our
                    April—thence called <hi rend="italic">Eostur-monath—</hi> was dedicated. This
                    month, Bede informs us, was the same as the “Mensie Paschalis,” when “the old
                    festival was observed with the gladuess of a new solemnity.’’</p>

                    erroneous derivation of <hi rend="italic">pascha</hi> is given by some of the
                    early fathers of the church, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Irenaeus, Tertullian,
                    &amp;c., to whom Hebrew was an unknown tongue, from the Greek 7rαcrχen∕, “to
                    suffer,” as being the period of our Lord's sufferings. St Augustine <hi
                    rend="italic">(in Joann. Track</hi> 55) notices this false etymology, and shows
                    how similarity of sound had led to the error, and gives the true derivation.</p>
                <p>There is no trace of the celebration of Easter as a Christian festival in the New
                    Testament or in the writings of the apostolic fathers. The sanctity of special
                    times or places was an idea quite alien from the early Christian mind, too
                    profoundly absorbed in the events themselves to think of their external
                    accidents. “The whole of time is a festival unto Christians because of the
                    excellency of the good things which have been given,” writes Chrysostom,
                    commenting on the passage 1 Cor. V. 7, which has been erroneously supposed to
                    refer to an apostolic observance of Easter. Origen also in the same spirit <hi
                    rend="italic">(Contr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Celsum,</hi> viii. 22) urges that
                    the Christian who dwells on the truths of Christ as our Passover and the gift of
                    the Holy Ghost, is every day keeping an Easter and Pentecostal feast. The
                    ecclesiastical historian Socrates <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl.,</hi> v. 22)
                    states with perfect truth that neither Christ nor his apostles enjoined the
                    keeping of this or any other festival. “The apostles,” he writes, “had no
                    thought of appointing festival days, but of promoting a life of blamelessness
                    and piety;” and he attributes the introduction of the festival of Easter into
                    the church to the perpetuation of an old usage, “just as many other customs have
                    been established.” This is doubtless the true statement of the case. The first
                    Christians, being derived from, or intimately connected with, the Jewish Church,
                    naturally continued to observe the Jewish festivals, though in anew spirit, as
                    commemorations of events of which these had been the shadows. The Passover,
                    ennobled by the thought of Christ the true Paschal Lamb, the first-fruits from
                    the dead, continued to be celebrated, and became the Christian Easter. Thus the
                    human instinct which everywhere craves for the commemoration of marked epochs in
                    the personal, social, ecclesiastical, or national life, found its legitimate
                    gratification in the public celebration of the events which are the foundation
                    of the Christian faith.</p>
                <p>But though the observance of the Paschal festival at a very early period became
                    the rule in the Christian church, a difference as to the time of its observance
                    speedily sprang up between Christians of Jewish and Gentile descent, which led
                    to a long-continued and bitter controversy, and an unhappy severance of
                    Christian union. No rule as to the date of the Easter festivals having been laid
                    down by authority, Christians were left to follow their own instincts. These
                    were naturally different in the Jewish and Gentile churches. The point at issue
                    really was the date of the termination of the Paschal fast. With the Jewish
                    Christians, whose leading thought would be the death of Christ as the true
                    Paschal Lamb, this fast would end at the same time as that of the Jews, on the
                    14th day of the moon, at evening, and the Easter festival would immediately
                    follow, entirely <hi rend="italic">irrespective of the day of the week.</hi>
                    With the Gentile Christians, on the other hand, unfettered by Jewish traditions,
                    the first day of the week would be identified with the Resurrection festival,
                    and the preceding Friday would be kept as the commemoration of the Crucifixion,
                    <hi rend="italic">irrespective of the day of the month,</hi> the fast continuing
                    with increasing strictness till the midnight of Saturday. With the one,
                    therefore, the observance of the day of the month, with the other the observance
                    of the day of the week, was the ruling principle. The chief point was the
                    “keeping” or “not keeping” the 14th day of the moon corresponding to that of the
                    month Nisan. Those who, adopting the Jewish rule, did so keep the 14th day were
                    called Teτpαδ∈κατιταt, Teτpaδιτaι, <hi rend="italic">Quartodecimani,</hi> and
                    were stigmatized as heretics. In the absence of any authoritative decision as to
                    the day to be observed and the proper mode of calculating it, other
                    discrepancies arose, which led to controversies and dissensions which, in the
                    words of Epiphanius <hi rend="italic">(Panar.,</hi> Haer. lxx.), distracted the
                    church, and became a source of mockery and ridicule to the unbelievers. “Some,”
                    he writes, “began the festival before the week, some after the week, some at the
                    beginning, some at the middle, some at the end, thus creating a wonderful and
                    laborious confusion.”</p>
                <p>This diversity of usage was gradually brought to an end by the verdict of the
                    Church of Rome. The Roman Christians adopted the ordinary Gentile usage, which,
                    within certain limits, placed the observance of the Crucifixion on a Friday, and
                    that of the Resurrection on the following Sunday. A decretal of Pope Pius I., c.
                    147—the genuineness of which, however, is by no means established—pronounces
                    that “the Pasch should be celebrated on the Lord’s Day by all.” His successor
                    Anicetus was equally firm upon the point. Polycarp, the venerable and sainted
                    bishop of Smyrna, who, according to Irenaeus <hi rend="italic">(apud</hi>
                    Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> v. 24), visited Rome in 159 with this
                    object, failed to induce Anicetus to conform to the Quartodeciman usage, which
                    Polycarp had inherited from his master, the Apostle John. Anicetus declined to
                    permit the Jewish custom in the churches under his jurisdiction, but made no
                    scruple of communicating with those who adopted it, and allowed Polycarp to
                    celebrate the Eucharist at Rome. Between thirty and forty years after this visit
                    (197) the same question was controverted in a very different spirit between
                    Victor, bishop of Rome, and Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, the aged metropolitan
                    of proconsular Asia. This province was the only portion of Christendom that
                    still maintained the Quartodeciman usage, which had been dropt even by the
                    churches of Palestine and Alexandria. Victor’s despotic demand that the Asiatic
                    churches should adopt the Roman system having been met by Polycrates with a
                    courteous but firm refusal, Victor proceeded to excommunicate him and all who
                    held with him. So sweeping a measure shocked the Christian world. Irenaeus
                    remonstrated with the bishop of Rome, and ultimately the Asiatic churches were
                    allowed to retain their usage unmolested. (Euseb., 7/. <hi rend="italic"
                    >E.,</hi> v. 23-25.) We still find the Quartodeciman usage springing up from
                    time to time in various places, but it never took permanent root, and at the
                    time of the Council of Nicaea (325) the Syrians and the Antiochenes were the
                    solitary champions of the Jewish rule. The settlement of this controversy was
                    one among the causes which led the emperor Constantine to summon that council.
                    The consent of the assembled prelates was unanimous. All agreed that Easter
                    should be kept on one and the same day throughout the world, and that none
                    should hereafter follow the blindness of the Jews (Socr., <hi rend="italic">H.
                    E.,</hi> i. 9). Nothing, however, was said as to the determination of the day.
                    This was practically left to be calculated at Alexandria, the home of
                    astronomical science, and the bishop of that see was to aunounce it annually to
                    the churches under his jurisdiction and to the bishop of Rome, by whom it was to
                    be communicated to the Western churches.</p>

                <p>But although measures had thus been apparently taken to secure uniformity of
                    observance, some centuries elapsed before all discrepancy ceased. Λ more
                    intricate question remained to be solved, viz., how the full moon on which
                    Easter depended was to be predicted. The Nicene decrees had effectually crushed
                    the feeble remnants of the Quartodeciman usage. It was established as a rule
                    that Easter must be kept on a Sunday, but there was no general agreement as to
                    the cycle by which the festival was to be calculated,—some churches adopting one
                    rule,some another. We learn from St Ambrose <hi rend="italic">lfEpist.</hi> 23)
                    that in 387 the churches of Gaul kept Easter on March 21, while the churches of
                    Italy postponed it to April 18, and those of Egypt a week later still, to April
                    25; and it appears from an epistle of Leo the Great <hi rend="italic"
                    >lfEpist.</hi> 64 <hi rend="italic">ad Marcian.}</hi> that in 455 there was
                    eight days’ difference between the Roman and Alexandrine Easter. Similar
                    discrepancies are mentioned by Gregory of Tours in the year 577, nor did they
                    disappear from the Gallican Church till the 8th century, although by a canon of
                    the fourth Council of Orleans (541) it had been ordained that the Easter
                    festival should be kept at the same time by all, according to the tables of
                    Victorius. The ancient British Church observed the 84 years’ cycle which they
                    had originally received from Rome, and their stubborn refusal to give it up
                    caused much bitter controversy between the fathers of Iona and the Latin
                    missionaries. These latter unfairly attempted to fix the stigma of the
                    Quartodeciman heresy on their opponents, and they are sometimes even now spoken
                    of as adopting the Asiatic mode of calculation, and false inferences are thence
                    drawn as to the Eastern origin of the British Church. This, however, is quite
                    erroneous. The early British and Irish Church always oommemorated the
                    Crucifixion on a Fιiday and the Resurrection on a Sunday. The only d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 'fference between them and the Romish Church was in
                    the cycle adopted for the computation of the festival,—-the British Church
                    really adhering to the cycle originally adopted by the Romish Church itself,
                    which had been superseded by the more accurate calculations of Victorius of
                    Aquitaine (457), and of Dionysius Exiguus (525). This led to a double Easter
                    being observed by the adherents of the two churches. Thus, as we learn from Bede
                    <hi rend="italic">(Eecl. Hist.,</hi> iii. 25), in 651 Queen Eanfleda, adopting
                    the Roman rule, was fasting and keeping Palm Sunday while her husband Oswy, king
                    of Northumbria, was celebrating the Easter festival. This diversity of usage was
                    put an end to in the kingdom of Northumbria in the council of Streaneshalch, or
                    Whitby (654); and the Roman rule was finally established in England by
                    Archbishop Theodore in 669. This rule may be thus briefly stated. Easter day is
                    the first Sunday after the 14th day (not the full moon) of the calendar moon
                    which happens on or next after March 21. This calendar moon, however, is not the
                    moon of the heavens, nor the mean moon of the astronomers, but an imaginary moon
                    created for ecclesiastical convenience in advance of the real moon (see Prof. De
                    Morgan’s article in <hi rend="italic">Companion to the Almanac,</hi> 1845).
                    After nine centuries a fresh discrepancy in the observance of Easter between the
                    Roman and the English Church was caused by the refusal in England to adopt the
                    Gregorian reformation of the calendar, 1582, apparently for no other reason than
                    that the alteration had originated at Rome. This difference was happily put an
                    end to in 1752, when the “New Style” was adopted in the United Kingdom. The
                    churches of Russia and Greece, and the Oriental churches generally, still
                    observe the unreformed calendar, their Easter falling sometimes before sometimes
                    after that of the Western church; very rarely, as in 1865, the two coincide.</p>

                <p>Easter day, as commemorating the central fact of our religion, has always been
                    regarded as the chief festival of the Christian year, and has been from the
                    earliest times observed with a stately and elaborate ceremonial. It is not,
                    however, the purpose of this article to enter on the ritual observances of
                    Easter, nor on the many curious and interesting popular customs—of which the
                    sending of Pasch eggs, or Easter eggs, is one of the most wide-spread— with
                    which it is connected in all Christian nations. For these last the reader may
