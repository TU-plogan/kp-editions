                <p><label type="entry">EGG</label>, the name given to the body formed in the female
                    reproductive organs, which, when impregnated by the male element, gives origin
                    to the young of animals. Although differing widely among themselves in form and
                    structure, the eggs of all animals are found to consist of the same essential
                    parts, viz., the germ cell, the yolk, and the yolk membrane, one chief
                    difference between them consisting in the relative quantity of the yolk element
                    present, this apparently depending on the degree of development which the young
                    attain before leaving the egg. Thus birds, which leave the shell in a highly
                    developed state, have in their eggs a large quantity of yolk, besides the
                    albumen or “white,” which is added to the egg before it receives the outer
                    calcaιeous covering and which, along with the yolk, serves as a storehouse of
                    food for the youug chick during the process of incubation. In insects, on the
                    other hand, which leave the egg in the immature condition of larvae, the yolk is
                    comparatively small, as it is also in mammals, whose eggs or ova are exceedingly
                    minute, and which owe the high development they attain before birth to
                    nourishment drawn directly from the parent. The majority of animals are <hi
                        rend="italic">oviparous,—</hi> that is, the eggs leave the body of the
                    female and are hatched outside; a few are <hi rend="italic">ovo-viviparous,</hi>
                    the eggs being retained in the oviduct until the young are ready to leave; while
                    mammals are <hi rend="italic">viviparous,</hi> the young, after leaving the egg,
                    attaining considerable development before birth, in the womb of the female. In
                    oviparous animals the egg, within certain limits, is proportional in size to
                    that of the adult form to which it gives origin; the larger the bird, for
                    example, the larger, as a rule, is the egg. This, however, is not without
                    exceptions; thus the egg of the guillemot is as large as that of the eagle, and
                    ten times larger than that of the raven, although guillemot and raven are of
                    nearly equal size.</p>
                <p>Owiug to the fluid nature of the contents of eggs, they are generally roundish in
                    form, although in this respect they also offer considerable variety; thus the
                    eggs of owls and of turtles are nearly spherical, those of ducks, crocodiles,
                    and snakes oval, and those of most sea-fowl pear-shaped. The external covering
                    is generally more or less smooth, as in the eggs of birds, but in the case of
                    insects they exhibit the most varied markings, being covered with spines,
                    tubercles, and pits, often symmetrically arranged. Considerable diversity also
                    exists in the composition of the outer covering of the egg in oviparous animals;
                    in snakes and lizards it consists of a parchment-like membrane not unlike the
                    inner coating of a hen’s egg; in birds, turtles, and crocodiles, there is a hard
                    calcareous shell; in cartilaginous fishes, as sharks and rays, the egg in
                    passing through the oviduct is imbedded in a four-sided horny case, from the
                    corners of which tendrils are given off, by which the egg-capsule is moored to
                    floating sea-weed. These, after the escape of the young fish, are often cast
                    upon the shore, where they are familiarly known as “mermaids’ purses.” The
                    external covering of the eggs of osseous fishes, as salmon and trout, is
                    exceedingly tough and elastic, “rebounding,” says Mr Frank Buckland, “from the
                    floor like an india-rubber ball;” and this no doubt prevents them from being
                    crushed in the gravelly beds of the running streams in which they are deposited.
                    The eggs of frogs and toads are surrounded with a tough layer of albuminous
                    substance, which expands in water into a transparent jelly. The eggs of the frog
                    occur in great masses, piled together like miniature cannon balls, while those
                    of the toad are connected together so as to resemble strings of beads. Among
                    many molluscous animals the eggs are provided with an additional covering or <hi
                        rend="italic">nidus,</hi> consisting of a leathery pouch or cup, containing
                    a large number of eggs. These capsules are either attached singly, by little
                    stalks, to the rocks as in the common purpura <hi rend="italic">(Purpura</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">lapillus),</hi> or are extruded in a compound mass as in the
                    whelk (j5wcc⅛⅛τn <hi rend="italic">undatum).</hi> Those of the latter were named
                    by Ellis “sea wash balls,” from being used by the sailors instead of soap to
                    wash their hands, and are common objects on the sea-shore. The greatest variety
                    exists in the number of eggs produced by different animals, and even among forms
                    allied to each other. Thus the common snail produces only from thirty to fifty
                    eggs at a time, while other mollusks, as the whelk, deposit their spawn in tens
                    of thousands. Among insects, the white ant is pre-eminently prolific, the queen
                    being said to lay about sixty eggs in a minute, or upwards of 80,000 in a day,
                    and as this probably continues for two years, it is estimated that the total
                    number of her eggs amounts to fifty millions. Among mollusks the spawn or <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0718-0697"/><hi rend="italic">spat,</hi> as it is called,
                    in a single mature oyster, numbers 1,800,000. Among vertebrate animals, fish are
                    the most prolific; the eggs or roe, as they are called, however, often fail to
                    get fertilized by the <hi rend="italic">milt</hi> of the male, and great
                    quantities are also eaten by fishes and crustaceans, so that they do not
                    increase so rapidly as might be supposed from the enormous number of their eggs.
                    Thus in trout and salmon there are over a thousand eggs to every pound of their
                    weight. According to Buckland <hi rend="italic">{Fish Culture)</hi> a roach
                    weighing f lb was found to contain 480,480 eggs; a herring weighing ⅜ lb,
                    19,840; a turbot of 8 lb weight, 385,200; and a cod of 20 lb, 4,872,000. Large
                    quantities of the roe of the cod are used in France as food, and also as bait in
                    the sardine fishery. The sturgeon is also exceedingly prolific, the eggs usually
                    forming one-third of the entire weight of the creature; and in Russia these, in
                    a prepared form known as <hi rend="italic">caviare,</hi> are much esteemed as a
                    table delicacy. The number of eggs in reptiles and birds is comparatively small,
                    the common English snake depositing 16 to 20 of these in such situations as
                    dung-hills, where they are left to be hatched by the heat generated in the
                    decomposing mass. The crocodile buries about 25 eggs on the muddy banks of the
                    rivers it frequents, and the turtle leaves the ocean to deposit from 150 to 200
                    on the shores of such oceanic islands as Ascension. The eggs of the crocodile
                    are considered a luxury by the natives along the banks of the Nile, while those
                    of the turtle are regarded as special delicacies by people of more refined
                    tastes. Of birds, the most prolific in eggs are those domesticated forms which
                    have been carefully selected by man for centuries, with a view to the
                    improvement of their egg-laying capacity. The chief of these are the duck, which
                    lays an egg daily during the season extending from March to July, and the
                    barn-door fowl, which produces annually about 120 eggs. The rearing of the
                    latter for egg-producing purposes has now become an important industry in France
                    and Belgium, and in a customs’ return just issued (July 1877) it is stated that
                    eggs were imported into Britain last year to the extent of 753 millions, valued
                    at £2,620,000. The number has increased 41 per cent, since 1872, and it is now
                    nearly seven times what it was in 1856. Besides these, the eggs of the turkey,
                    the guinea fowl, the partridge, and other gallinaceous birds are in great
                    request as articles of food. The eggs of the guillemot are also occasionally
                    offered for sale in our markets, while these and the eggs of other species of
                    seafowl form an important article of food among the western islands and along
                    the north-western sea-coast of Scotland. The largest eggs are those produced by
                    the emu and the ostrich, a single ostrich egg weighing as much as three dozen
                    eggs of the barn-door fowl. These are eaten in Africa both by the natives and by
                    Europeans. From two to five female ostriches are said to deposit their eggs (10
                    in number) in one nest, and the natives by removing, during the absence of the
                    female, a few of these at a time, taking care not to touch them with their
                    fingers, but using sticks to prevent any taint of their presence being left
                    behind, get them to continue depositing eggs for a considerable time to supply
                    the place of those removed. The shells are used throughout Africa as
                    drinking-cups. The egg of the moa, some specimens of which have been found
                    buried in New Zealand, is much larger than that of the ostrich, measuring in one
                    specimen 10 inches in length and 7 inches broad. A still larger egg has been
                    found fossil in Madagascar, the produce of the extinct aepiornis, and having a
                    capacity equal to that of 148 eggs of the common fowl.</p>
