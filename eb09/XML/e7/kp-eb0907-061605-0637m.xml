                    Wiirtemberg, was born December 2, 1445. He was the second son of Count Ludwig
                    I., who died in 1450; and he succeeded his elder brother, Ludwig IL, at the age
                    of twelve (1457). The guardianship of the young count was assumed by his uncle,
                    Count Ulrich, and he had for tutor the learned John Nauclerus. Coveting power
                    and careless of learning, he profited little by the learning of his tutor; and
                    at the age of fourteen he succeeded in throwing off the restraint of the
                    guardianship, and assumed the government. But instead of discharging its duties
                    he thought only of indulging his passions, and for a time led a wild, reckless
                    life. By some means he was brought to serious reflections, and we find him,
                    according to a custom which had not become wholly extinct, undertaking in 1468
                    the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He also visited Italy, and made acquaintance with
                    some of the most famous scholars of the age. His marriage with Barbara, daughter
                    of Lodovico di Gonzaga, contributed to the amendment and elevation of his
                    character. He began to study and to take a practical interest in the promotion
                    of the new learning, and at the instigation of his wife he founded, in 1477, the
                    university of Tübingen. Hither came, in 1481, <pb break="no"

                    Greek at the university and took his degree of doctor of laws. Count Eberhard
                    conceived a great liking for him, appointed him his private secretary, and named
                    him councillor. In the spring of 1482 Eberhard, accompanied by Reuchlin, visited
                    Rome, had an audience of Pope Sixtus IV., and received from him the Golden Rose.
                    On his return he visited Florence, and enjoyed the society of the group of
                    scholars gathered around Lorenzo de’ Medici. It was in the same year that
                    Eberhard, by the treaty of Minzingen, put an end to the evils which had arisen
                    from a division of the county made in 1437 between his father and his uncle
                    Ulrich, a3 representatives of the two lines of Urach and Stuttgart, and secured
                    the future indivisibility of Wiirtemberg, and the right of primogeniture in his
                    own family. The treaty was made under the guarantee of the empire, and was
                    sanctioned by an assembly of prelates, knights, and landed proprietors. By a
                    limitation of the power of the prince agreed to at the same time, Count Eberhard
                    became the founder of the constitution of Wurtemberg. He made Stuttgart his
                    place of residence, and retained Reuchlin in his service till his own death.
                    Eberhard sympathized with the desire that was daily strengthening for a thorough
                    reformation in the church; and in his own dominions he rendered great services
                    by his regulation of convents. Some of these institutions he secularized. Though
                    a lover of peace, he knew how to bear the sword when war was necessary; and by
                    his courage, wisdom, and fidelity to his engagements he secured the esteem and
                    friendship of the emperors Frederick III. and Maximilian I., as well as that of
                    other princes of his time. He was one of the leading members of the Grand
                    Swabiau League formed in 1488, and took part in the liberation of Maximilian,
                    then king of the Romans, from his imprisonment at Bruges. In recognition of his
                    great services the emperor at his first diet, held at Worms in 1495, raised
                    Eberhard, without any solicitation on his part, to the dignity of duke,
                    confirming at the same time all the possessions and prerogatives of his house
                    Duke Eberhard did not live long to enjoy his new dignity. He died at Tübingen on
                    the 25th of February 1496. He had two children by his marriage; but these died
                    in their infancy, and with him the line of Urach became extinct.</p>
