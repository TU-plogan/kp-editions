                <p><label type="entry">ECCLESIA</label>, in Grecian antiquity, the general assembly
                    of Athenian citizens, who met from time to time to discuss public affairs.
                    Ecclesiae were of two kinds, ordinary and extraordinary. The first of these were
                    held, according to the laws of Solon, four times in each prytany, or period of
                    thirty-five days; while the others were only summoned on some pressing
                    emergency. When any measure of unusual importance was to be publicly debated,
                    the people were summoned from the country by special messengers. An assembly
                    thus convened was called a <hi rend="italic">cataclesia.</hi> Much discussion
                    has taken place as to the exact days of the month on which the ecclesiae were
                    held; but the result has only been to prove either that there were no days
                    invariably fixed for them, or that we have no data by which to determine
                    accurately what these days were. In Ulpian it is stated that when there were
                    three assemblies a-month, the first fell on the eleventh, the second on the
                    twentieth, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0644-0623"/> the third about the thirtieth of the month. The
                    likelihood is that they were held at regular intervals though the days were not
                    absolutely fixed. Ecclesiae were originally held in the Agora or Forum. The
                    place of meeting was subsequently removed to the Pnyx, and afterwards to such of
                    the greater temples as might be most convenient. The Pnyx lay to the west of the
                    Areopagus, and commanded an extensive view. It was partly within the city walls,
                    and had an area of about 12,000 square yards. On its northern side, cut out of
                    the solid rock, was the <hi rend="italic">bema</hi> or hustings from which the
                    speakers addressed the people. From this tribunal a splendid view of the
                    principal buildings of the city might be had. The right of assembling the people
                    lay with the prytanes, or presidents of the senate or Council of Five Hundred,
                    who both advertised beforehand the business to be discussed, and on the day of
                    meeting sent round a crier to remind the citizens that their presence was
                    required. In times of war, however, or other national crises, the generals of
                    the army sometimes assumed this privilege, though it was necessary for them in
                    doing so to give notice of their intention by a public proclamation. They also
                    sometimes claimed the right of preventing the ecclesia from assembling; but
                    their claims to this privilege were not generally recognized. Such of the
                    citizens as refused to attend were fined, and six magistrates called lexiarchs
                    were appointed to collect the fines. To assure a full meeting, the custom was
                    ultimately introduced of paying the poorer classes a small sum for their
                    attendance. This sum was originally an obolus, but after the time of Pericles it
                    was raised to three, According to the usual order the proceedings of an ecclesia
                    were commenced by a lustration or ceremonial purification of the place of
                    assembly. The victims sacrificed were usually sucking pigs, whose blood was
                    sprinkled round the boundary of the assembly. The crier next offered up a prayer
                    to the gods for guidance, after which the business for which the assembly had
                    been convened was introduced. According to the laws of Solon, the crier first
                    called upon citizens above fifty years of age to speak and then upon all others;
                    but this distinction was afterwards abolished, and the discussion was open from
                    the commencement to all citizens of whatever age. The vote was generally taken
                    by show of hands. In certain special cases, however, such as those affecting
                    individual rights, the ballot was used. The decision to which the assembly came
                    was called <hi rend="italic">Αpsephisma.</hi> The ecclesia was sometimes
                    adjourned from one day to the next, and it generally broke up at once if any of
                    those present declared that he had seen an unfavourable omen or if thunder and
                    lightning occurred. The word <hi rend="italic">ecclesia</hi> came to mean any
                    assembly regularly convened, and in New Testament Greek it is used to denote the
                    assembly of Christians in any particular place, or the Christian church.</p>
