                    life. She fasted much and slept little, wore a hair chemise and iron stays, and
                    made her household so uncomfortable by her arrangements that her husband, with
                    her consent, retired to a monastery at Eynesham, as likely to be a more
                    enjoyable home. The story of Edmund’s birth and early years is strewn with
                    marvel and miracle. Trained by his mother, he caught her ascetic spirit, and
                    became a willing imitator of her self-tormenting ways. At the age of twelve he
                    was sent to a school at Oxford, where he studied diligently, but continued his
                    ascetic exercises. Naturally susceptible in a high degree to the charm of
                    beauty, he nevertheless vowed a vow of celibacy, and espoused himself to the
                    Blessed Virgin Mary. At Oxford he was prostrated by a brain fever; his mother
                    attended him, and by her desire he received the clerical tonsure. Shortly after,
                    his father apparently being dead, he was sent to Paris to study at the
                    university. He was called home to attend his mother on her death-bed; and during
                    the next twelve months he lived in retirement in the convent of Merton, in
                    Surrey. He then returned to Oxford, and at once took an honourable place among
                    the teachers of the university, which he retained for some years. He is
                    distinguished as one of the scholars who introduced the study of Aristotle; and
                    he heartily co-operated with those who were striving to recover for Oxford the
                    popularity and prosperity as a place of study which it had recently lost, in
                    consequence of a disturbance (1209) between town and gown, and the migration of
                    students and masters in very large numbers. Edmund ultimately resolved to devote
                    himself to theology, was ordained priest, and took his degree in divinity. “He
                    is the first of our archbishops,” says Dean Hook, “to whose name we find the
                    title of S.T.P. attached—the first doctor of divinity.” About 1222 he was
                    appointed treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral, and in this office, which he held
                    about eleven years, and to which the prebend of Caine was attached, he endeared
                    himself alike to rich and poor. In 1227 Dr Edmund was one of the preachers of
                    the sixth crusade. In 1233 he was elected to the vacant primacy. Three elections
                    had previously been made by the chapter, which the Pope for various reasons had
                    refused to confirm; and this, the fourth, was made by the Pope’s suggestion, as
                    a compromise acceptable to “Pope, king, and monks,” says Fuller, “three cords
                    seldom twisted in the same cable.” The <hi rend="italic">pallium</hi> was sent
                    to England without waiting for the decision of the chapter. The position of the
                    primate was at that time one of peculiar difficulty, and it was with unfeigned
                    reluctance that Edmund accepted it,—feeling, says Lingard, “that the timidity of
                    his conscience would not suffer him to acquiesce in the disorders of the age,
                    and that the gentleness of his temper did not fit him for the stern office of a
                    reformer.” The new archbishop attached himself and steadfastly adhered to the
                    national party, whose great object was to insure the independence of the
                    kingdom, the maintenance of the Great Charter, and the exclusion of foreigners
                    from civil and ecclesiastical offices. Early in 1234, before his consecration,
                    he convened a council at Westminster, by which a remonstrance was addressed to
                    the king, requiring him, on pain of the censures of the church, to dismiss his
                    foreign councillors, especially Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester, through
                    whose influence the strongholds of the kingdom were then in the hands of foreign
                    mercenaries. The consecration of the archbishop was celebrated at Canterbury on
                    the 2d April 1234, and the king was present with all his court. One week later
                    the primate held a second council, and was commissioned by it to threaten the
                    king with excommunication if he did not comply with the terms of the former
                    council. This measure was effectual. The archbishop was then sent into Wales to
                    negotiate a peace with the Prince Llewelyn. In May he held a council at
                    Gloucester, and here was accomplished a temporary reconciliation between the
                    king and the people. In January 1236 the primate had the costly privilege of a
                    royal visit, Henry III. going to Canterbury to await the coming of his
                    bride-elect, Eleanor of Provence; and on the 14th the marriage ceremony was
                    performed by the archbishop. A few days later he officiated at the coronation of
                    the queen. But the hopeless divergence of aims between the king and the
                    archbishop, and the inflexible courage and decision of the latter, induced Henry
                    to apply secretly to the Pope, Gregory IX., to send a legate to reside in
                    England, whose authority might nullify that of the archbishop. Meanwhile, the
                    latter issued, in 1236, his constitutions, which are of no little interest on
                    account of the indications they furnish of the state of the church and of
                    general society. The picture is not a flattering one. In 1237 arrived the
                    legate, Cardinal Otho, who at once won <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n690/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0690-0669"/> his way into the royal favour. In November he
                    held a council at St Paul’s, but failed to carry his main points against the
                    opposition of the clergy. He stood high, however, with the king, and used or
                    abused his prerogatives for effecting his own purposes. Archbishop Edmund now
                    found himself in opposition to both the king and the Pope; and his position was
                    rendered still more difficult by his excommunication of Simon de Montfort and
                    his bride Eleanor, sister of the king, whose marriage after having taken a vow
                    of perpetual widowhood he felt bound to condemn. In 1238, with a view to
                    obtaining the support of the Pope for his project of monastic reform, Edmund
                    went to Rome. But in this mission he failed. Not only was his purpose
                    frustrated, but he was treated with marked insult by the Pope; and he returned
                    to England sad at heart and burdened with pecuniary difficulties. He soon found
                    that he was reduced to a cipher; he saw the Papal exactions continually
                    growing—“vexed,” says Fuller, “at the polling and peeling of the English people
                    ”—and saw that the legate’s great object was to crush him. In 1240, therefore,
                    he left England, and took up his abode at the abbey of Pontigny, in France,
                    where Thomas Becket and Stephen Langton had previously found an asylum. At his
                    landing he was met by the queen of France, who brought her sons, among them (St)
                    Louis, to receive his blessing. His health was now broken down, and he “sighed
                    out the remainder of his life” in quiet retirement, broken only by occasional
                    preaching. Becoming weaker and weaker, he removed, for the sake of a better
                    climate, to the priory of Soissy, and there he died, November 16, 1240. His
                    tomb, within a year, began to be famous for miracles; and in 1246, after much
                    resistance on the part of the Pope, the archbishop, the staunch foe of Papal
                    extortions, was canonized. He left a work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiae,</hi> which he appears to have
                    completed at Pontigny.</p>
                <p>Two contemporary biographies of St Edmund are extant, one by his brother Robert
                    Rich, the other by Bertrand, prior of Pontigny, the usual admixture of
                    miraculous and incredible details being found in their accounts. (W. L. R. C.
