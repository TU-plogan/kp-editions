                <p><label type="entry">EAR</label>. The simplest form of the organ of hearing is a
                    small sac containing fluid, with the auditory nerve expanded upon it. Sonorous
                    vibrations are communicated to this sac either directly through the hard parts
                    of the head, or at the same time by a membrane exposed to the surrounding
                    medium. Such is the form of ear found in many of the Crustacea and in the
                    Cephalopoda. In the Vertebrata, there is a progressive development and
                    increasing complexity from the fishes up to Mammalia. For details as to the
                    structure of the ear in the different subdivisions of the Vertebrata, reference
                    is made to the articles treating of these, such as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Amphibia, Birds, &amp;c.</hi>; and the structure of the human ear will be found
                    fully described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Axatomy,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    891. It is the object of this article to describe the phenomena of auditory
                    sensation from the physiological point of view.</p>
                <p>The sense of hearing is a special sensation the cause of which is an excitation
                    of the auditory nerves by the vibrations of sonorous bodies. A description of
                    sonorous vibrations and of their transmission is given in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Acoustics</hi>; here we shall consider, first, the transmission
                    of such vibrations from the external ear to the auditory nerve, and secondly,
                    the physiological characters of auditory sensation.</p>
                <p>I.—1. <hi rend="italic">Transmission in External Ear.—</hi> The external ear
                    consists of the <hi rend="italic">pinna,</hi> or auricle, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">external auditory meatus,</hi> or canal, at the bottom of which we
                    find the <hi rend="italic">membrana tympani,</hi> or drum head. In many animals
                    the auricle is trumpet-shaped, and, being freely movable by muscles, serves to
                    collect sonorous waves coming from various directions. The auricle of the human
                    ear presents many irregularities of surface. If these irregularities are
                    abolished by filling them up with a soft material such as wax or oil, leaving
                    the entrance to the canal free, experiment shows that the intensity of sounds is
                    weakened, and that there is more difficulty in judging of their direction. When
                    waves of sound strike the auricle, they are partly reflected outwards, while the
                    remainder, impinging at various angles, undergo a number of reflections so as to
                    be directed into the auditory canal. Vibrations are transmitted along the
                    auditory canal, partly by the air it contains and partly by its walls, to the
                    membrana tympani. The absence of the auricle, as the result of accident or
                    injury, has not caused diminution of hearing. In the auditory canal, waves of
                    sound are reflected from side to side until they reach the membrana tympani.
                    From the obliquity in position and peculiar curvature of this membrane, most of
                    the waves must strike it nearly perpendicularly, and in the most advantageous
                    direction.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Transmission in Middle Ear.—</hi> The middle ear is a small
                    cavity, the walls of which are rigid with the exception of the portions
                    consisting of the membrana tympani, and the membrane of the round window and of
                    the apparatus filling the oval window. This cavity communicates with the pharynx
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Eustachian tube,</hi> which forms a kind of air-tube
                    between the pharynx and the tympanum for the purpose of regulating pressure on
                    the membrana tympani. It is generally supposed that during rest the tube is
                    open, and that it is closed during the act of deglutition. As this action is
                    frequently taking place, not only when food or drink is introduced, but when
                    saliva is swallowed, it is evident that the pressure of the air in the tympanum
                    will be kept in a state of equilibrium with that of the external air on the
                    outer surface of the membrana tympani, and that thus the membrana tympani will
                    be rendered independent of variations of atmospheric pressure such as may occur
                    within certain limits, as when we descend in a diving bell or ascend in a
                    balloon. By a forcible expiration, the oral and nasal cavities being closed, air
                    may be driven into the tympanum, while a forcible inspiration (Valsalva’s
                    experiment) will draw air from that cavity. In the first case, the membrana
                    tympani will bulge outwards, in the second case inwards, and in both, from
                    excessive stretching of the membrane, there will be partial deafness, especially
                    for sounds of high pitch. Permanent occlusion of the tube is one of the most
                    common causes of deafness,</p>
                <p>The membrana tympani is capable of being set into vibration by a sound of any
                    pitch included in the range of perceptible sounds. It responds exactly as to
                    number of vibrations (pitch), intensity of vibrations (intensity), and
                    complexity of vibration (quality or timbre). Consequently we can hear a sound of
                    any given pitch, of a certain intensity, and in its own specific timbre or
                    quality. Generally speaking, very high tones are heard more easily than low
                    tones of the same intensity. As the membrana tympani is not only fixed by its
                    margin to a ring or tube of bone, but is also adherent to the handle of the
                    malleus, which follows its movements, its vibrations meet with considerable
                    resistance. This diminishes the intensity of its vibrations, and prevents also
                    the continued vibration of the membrane after an external vibration has ceased,
                    so that a sound is not heard much longer than it lasts. The tension of the
                    membrane may be affected (1) by differences of pressure on the two surfaces of
                    the membrana tympani, as may occur during forcible expiration or inspiration, or
                    in a pathological condition, and (2) by muscular action, due to contraction of
                    the <hi rend="italic">tensor</hi><hi rend="italic">tympani</hi> muscle. This
                    small muscle arises from the apex of the petrous temporal and the cartilage of
                    the Eustachian tube, enters the tympanum at its anterior wall, and is inserted
                    into the malleus near its root. The handle of the malleus is inserted between
                    the layers of the membrana tympani, and, as the malleus and incus move round an
                    axis passing through the neck of the malleus from before backwards, the action
                    of the muscle is to pull the membrana tympani inwards towards the tympanic
                    cavity in the form of a cone, the meridians of which, according to Helmholtz,
                    are not straight but curved, with convexity outwards. When the muscle contracts,
                    the handle of the malleus is drawn still farther inwards, and thus a greater
                    tension of the tympanic membrane is produced. On relaxation of the muscle, the
                    membrane returns to its position of equilibrium by its own elasticity and by the
                    elasticity of the chain of bones. This power of varying the tension of the
                    membrane is a kind of accommodating mechanism for receiving and transmitting
                    sounds of different pitch. With different degrees of tension, it will respond
                    more readily to sounds of different pitch. Thus, when the membrane is tense, it
                    will readily respond to high sounds, while relaxation will be the condition most
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n613/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0613-0592"/> adapted for low sounds. In addition, increased
                    tension of the membrane, by increasing the resistance, will diminish the
                    intensity of vibrations. This is especially the case for sounds of low
                    pitch.</p>
                <p>Helmholtz has also pointed out that the peculiar form of the membrana tympani in
                    man has the effect of increasing the force of its vibrations at the expense of
                    their amplitude.</p>
                <p>The vibrations of the membrana tympani are transmitted to the internal ear partly
                    by the air which the middle ear or tympanum contains, and partly by the chain of
                    bones, consisting of the malleus, incus, and stapes. Of these, transmission by
                    the chain of bones is by far the most important. In birds and in the scaly
                    amphibia, this chain is represented by a single rod-like ossicle, the <hi
                    rend="italic">columella,</hi> but in man the two membranes—the membrana tympani
                    and the membrane filling the fenestra ovalis—are connected by a compound lever
                    consisting of three bones, namely, the <hi rend="italic">malleus,</hi> or
                    hammer, inserted into the membrana tympani, the tneuβ, or anvil, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">stapes,</hi> or stirrup, the base of which fits into the oval
                    window. The lever thus formed has its fulcrum near the short process of the
                    incus, which abuts against the tympanic wall; the power is applied at the handle
                    of the malleus, and the resistance is at the base of the stirrup. Both by direct
                    experimental observation and by calculation from data supplied by measurement of
                    the lengths of the arms of the lever, Helmholtz has shown that by this
                    arrangement vibrations are diminished in extent in the ratio of 3 to 2, but are
                    inversely increased in force. Considering the great resistance offered to
                    excursions of the stapes, such an arrangement must be advantageous. It must also
                    be noted that in the transmission of vibrations of the membrana tympani to the
                    fluid in the labyrinth or internal ear, through the oval window, the chain of
                    ossicles vibrates as a whole and acts efficiently, although its length may be
                    only a small fraction of the wave length of the sound transmitted.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Transmission in the Internal Ear.—</hi> The internal ear is
                    composed of the labyrinth, formed of the vestibule or central part, the
                    semicircular canals, and the cochlea, each of which consists of an osseous and a
                    membranous portion (see vol. i. p. 893). The osseous labyrinth may be regarded
                    as an osseous mould in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, lined by
                    tesselated endothelium, and containing a small quantity of fluid called the <hi
                    rend="italic">perilymph.</hi> In this mould, partially surrounded by, and to
                    some extent floating in, this fluid, there is the membranous labyrinth, in
                    certain parts of which we find the terminal apparatus in connection with the
                    auditory nerve, immersed in another fluid called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >endolymp)h.</hi> The membranous labyrinth consists of a vestibular portion
                    formed by two small sac-like dilatations, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >saccule</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">utricle,</hi> the latter of which
                    communicates with the semicircular canals by five openings. Each canal consists
                    of a tube, bulging out at each extremity so as to form the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">ampulla,</hi> in which, on a projecting ridge, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">crista acoustica,</hi> there are cells bearing or developed into
                    long <hi rend="italic">auditory hairs,</hi> which are to be regarded as the
                    peripheral end-organs of the vestibular branches of the auditory nerve. The
                    cochlear division of the membranous labyrinth consists of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">cochlearis,</hi> a tube of triangular form fitting
                    in between the two cavities in the cochlea, called the <hi rend="italic">scala
                    vestibuli,</hi> because it commences in the vestibule, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scala tympani,</hi> because it ends in the tympanum, at the round window. These
                    two scalae communicate at the apex of the cochlea. The roof of the ductus
                    cochlearis is formed by a thin membrane called the <hi rend="italic">membrane of
                    Peissner,</hi> while its floor consists of the <hi rend="italic">basilar
                    membrane,</hi> on which we find the remarkable <hi rend="italic">organ of
                    Corti,</hi> which constitutes the terminal organ of the cochlear division of the
                    auditory nerve, and which is fully described in vol. i. p. 894. It is sufficient
                    to state here that this organ consists essentially of an arrangement of
                    epithelial cells bearing hairs which are in communication with the terminal
                    filaments of this portion of the auditory nerve, and that groups of these hairs
                    pass through holes in a closely investing membrane, <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">reticularis,</hi> which may be supposed to act
                    as a damping apparatus, so as quickly to stop their movements. The ductus
                    cochlearis and the two scalae are filled with fluid. Sonorous vibrations may
                    reach the fluid in the labyrinth by three different ways—(1) by the osseous
                    walls of the labyrinth, (2) by the air in the tympanum and the round window, and
                    (3) by the base of the stapes inserted into the oval window.</p>
                <p>When the head is plunged into water, or brought into direct contact with any
                    vibrating body, vibrations must be transmitted directly. Vibrations of the air
                    in the mouth and in the nasal passages are also communicated directly to the
                    walls of the cranium, and thus pass to the labyrinth. In like manner, we may
                    experience peculiar auditive sensations, such as blowing, rubbing, and hissing
                    sounds, due to muscular contraction or to the passage of blood in vessels close
                    to the auditory organ. It has not been satisfactorily made out to what extent,
                    if any, vibrations may be communicated to the fluid in the labyrinth by the
                    round window. There can be no doubt, however, that in ordinary hearing
                    vibrations are communicated chiefly by the chain of bones. When the base of the
                    stirrup is pushed into the oval window, the pressure in the labyrinth increases,
                    the impulse passes along the scala vestibuli to the scala tympani, and, as the
                    only mobile part of the wall of the labyrinth is the membrane covering the round
                    window, this membrane is forced outwards; when the base of the stirrup passes
                    outwards, a reverse action takes place. Thus the fluid of the labyrinth may
                    receive a series of pulses or vibrations isochronous with the movements of the
                    base of the stirrup, and these pulses affect the terminal apparatus in
                    connection with the auditory nerve.</p>
                <p>Since the size of the membranous labyrinth is so small, measuring, in man, not
                    more than ⅜ inch in length by ∣th inch in diameter at its widest part, and since
                    it is a chamber consisting partly of conduits of very irregular form, it is
                    impossible to state accurately the course of vibrations transmitted to it by
                    impulses communicated from the base of the stirrup. In the cochlea, vibrations
                    must pass from the saccule along the scala vestibuli to the apex, thus affecting
                    the membrane of Reissner, which forms its roof; then, passing through the
                    opening at the apex (the <hi rend="italic">helicotrema),</hi> they must descend
                    by the scala tympani to the round window, and affect in their passage the
                    membrana basilaris, on which the organ of Corti is situated. From the round
                    window impulses must be reflected backwards, but how they affect the advancing
                    impulses is not known. But the problem is even more complex when we take into
                    account the fact that impulses are transmitted simultaneously to the utricle and
                    to the semicircular canals communicating with it by five openings. The mode of
                    action of these vibrations or impulses upon the nervous terminations is still
                    unknown; but to appreciate critically the hypothesis which has been advanced to
                    explain it, it is necessary, in the first place, to refer to some of the general
                    characters of auditory sensation.</p>
                <p>4. Certain conditions are necessary for excitation of the auditory nerve
                    sufficient to produce a sensation. In the first place, the vibrations must have
                    a certain amplitude: if too feeble, no impression will be produced. The minimum
                    limit has been stated to be the sensation caused by the falling of a ball of
                    pith, 1 millegramme in weight, upon a smooth surface, such as glass, from a
                    height of 1 millimetre at a distance of 91 millimetres from the ear.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n614/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0614-0593"/>
                <p>In the next place, vibrations must have a certain duration to be perceived; and
                    lastly, to excite a sensation of a continuous musical sound, a certain number of
                    vibrations must occur in a given interval of time. The lower limit is about 30,
                    and the upper about 30,000 vibrations per second. Below 30, the individual
                    impulses may be observed, and above 30,000 few ears can detect any sound at all.
                    The extreme upper limit is not more than 35,000 vibrations per second. Auditory
                    sensations are of two kinds—noises and musical sounds. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Noises</hi> are caused by impulses which are not regular in intensity or
                    duration, or are not periodic, or they may be caused by a series of musical
                    sounds occurring instantaneously so as to pro duce discords, as when we place
                    our hand at random on the key-board of a piano. <hi rend="italic">Musical
                    tones</hi> are produced by periodic and regular vibrations. In musical sounds
                    three characters are prominent—intensity, pitch, and quality. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Intensity</hi> depends on the amplitude of the vibration, and a greater or
                    lesser amplitude of the vibration will cause a corresponding movement of the
                    transmitting apparatus, and a corresponding intensity of excitation of the
                    terminal apparatus. <hi rend="italic">Pitch,</hi> as a sensation, depends on the
                    length of time in which a single vibration is executed, or, in other words, the
                    number of vibrations in a given interval of time. The ear is capable of
                    appreciating the relative pitch or height of a sound as compared with another,
                    although it may not ascertain precisely the absolute height of a sound. What we
                    call an acute or high tone is produced by a large number of vibrations, while a
                    grave or low tone is caused by few. The musical tones which can be used with
                    advantage range between 40 and 4000 vibrations per second, extending thu3 from 6
                    to 7 octaves. According to E. H. Weber, practised musicians can perceive a
                    difference of pitch amounting even to only the ⅛th of a semitone, but this is
                    far beyond average attainment. <hi rend="italic">Quality</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">timbre</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Klang}</hi> is that peculiar
                    characteristic of a musical sound by which we may identify it as proceeding from
                    a particular instrument or from a particular human voice. It depends on the fact
                    that many waves of sound that reach the ear are really compound wave systems,
                    built up of constituent waves, each of which is capable of exciting a sensation
                    of a simple tone if it be singled out and reinforced by a resonator (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Acoustics),</hi> and which may sometimes be heard without a
                    resonator, after special practice and tuition. Thus it appears thgt the ear must
                    have some arrangement by which it resolves every wave system, however complex,
                    into simple pendular vibrations. When we listen to a sound of any quality we
                    recognize that it is of a certain pitch. This depends on the number of
                    vibrations of one tone, predominant in intensity over the others, called the
                    fundamental or ground tone, or first partial tone. The quality, or timbre,
                    depends on the number and intensity of other tones added to it. These are termed
                    <hi rend="italic">harmonic or partial tones,</hi> and they are related to the
                    first partial or fundamental tone in a very simple manner, being multiples of

                <p>When a simple tone, or one free from partials, is heard, it gives rise to a
                    simple, soft, somewhat insipid sensation, as may be obtained by blowing across
                    the mouth of an open bottle or by a tuning fork. The lower partials added to the
                    fundamental tone give softness combined with richness; while the higher,
                    especially if they be very high, produce a brilliant and thrilling effect, as is
                    caused by the brass instruments of an orchestra. Such being the facts, how may
                    they be explained physiologically?</p>
                <p>Little is yet known regarding the mode of action of the vibrations of the fluid
                    in the labyrinth upon the terminal apparatus connected with the auditory nerve.
                    There can be no doubt that it is a mechanical action, a true communication of
                    impulses to delicate hair-like processes, by the movements of which the nervous
                    filaments are irritated. In the human ear it has been estimated that there are
                    about 3000 small arches formed by the <hi rend="italic">rods of Corti</hi> (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy).</hi> Each arch rests on the basilar membrane, and
                    supports rows of cells having minute hair-like processes somewhat resembling
                    cilia. It would appear also that the filaments of the auditory nerve terminate
                    in the basilar membrane, and possibly they may be connected with the hair-cells.
                    At one time it was supposed by Helmholtz that these fibres of Corti were elastic
                    and that they were tuned for particular sounds, so as to form a regular series
                    corresponding to all the tones audible to the human ear. Thus 2800 fibres
                    distributed over the tones of seven octaves would give 400 fibres for each
                    octave, or nearly 33 for a semitone. Helmholtz has put forward the ingenious
                    hypothesis that, when a pendular vibration reaches the ear, it excites by
                    sympathetic vibration the fibre of Corti which is tuned for its proper number of
                    vibrations. If, then, different fibres are tuned to tones of different pitch, it
                    is evident that we have here a mechanism which, by exciting different nerve
                    fibres, will give rise to sensations of pitch. When the vibration is not simple
                    but compound, in consequence of the blending of vibrations corresponding to
                    various harmonics or partial tones, the ear has the power of resolving this
                    compound vibration into its elements. It can only do so by different fibres
                    responding to the constituent vibrations of the sound,—one for the fundamental
                    tone being stronger, and giving the sensation of a particular pitch or height to
                    the sound, and the others, corresponding to the upper partial tones, being
                    weaker, and causing special though undefined sensations, which are so blended
                    together in consciousness as to terminate in a complex sensation of a tone of a
                    certain quality or timbre. It would appear at first sight that 33 fibres of
                    Corti for a semitone are not sufficient to enable us to detect all the
                    gradations of pitch in that interval, since, as has been stated above, trained
                    musicians may distinguish a difference of ⅛th of a semitone. To meet this
                    difficulty, Helmholtz states that if a sound is produced, the pitch of which may
                    be supposed to come between two adjacent fibres of Corti, both of these will be
                    set into sympathetic vibration, but the one which comes nearest to the pitch of
                    the sound will vibrate with greater intensity than the other, and that
                    consequently the pitch of that sound would be thus appreciated. These
                    theoretical views of Helmholtz have derived much support from remarkable
                    experiments of Hensen, who observed that certain hairs on the antennae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mysis,</hi> a Crustacean, when observed with a low miscroscopic
                    power, vibrated with certain tones produced by a keyed horn. It was seen that
                    certain tones of the horn set some hairs into strong vibration, and other tones
                    other hairs. Each hair responded also to several tones of the horn. Thus one
                    hair responded strongly to <hi rend="italic">d§</hi> and tZ'⅛, more weakly to
                    <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and very weakly to G. It was probably tuned to some
                    pitch between <hi rend="italic">d"</hi> and &lt;7"$. <hi rend="italic">(Studien
                    über das Gehörorgan der Decapoden,</hi> Leipsic, 1863.)</p>
                <p>Recent histological researches have led to a modification of this hypothesis. It
                    has been found that the rods or arches of Corti are stiff structures, not
                    adapted for vibrating, but apparently consisting of a kind of support for the
                    hair cells. It is also known that there are no rods of Corti in the cochlea of
                    birds, which apparently are capable nevertheless of appreciating pitch. Hensen
                    and Helmholtz have now suggested the view that not only may the segments of the
                    membrana basilaris be stretched more in the radial thaι&gt; <pb break="no"

                    segments may be stretched radially with different degrees of tension so as to
                    resemble a series of tense strings of gradually increasing length. Each string
                    would then respond to a vibration of a particular pitch communicated to it by
                    the hair-cells. The exact mechanism of the hair-cells and of the membrana
                    reticularis, which looks like a damping apparatus, is unknown.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Physiological Characters of Auditory Sensation.—</hi> 1.
                    Under ordinary circumstances auditory sensations are referred to the outer
                    world. When we hear a sound, we associate it with some external cause, and it
                    appears to originate in a particular place, or to come in a particular
                    direction. This feeling of <hi rend="italic">exteriority</hi> of sound seems to
                    require transmission through, the membrana tympani. Sounds which are sent
                    through the walls of the cranium, as when the head is immersed in, and the
                    external auditory canals are filled with, water, appear to originate in the body
                    itself. It is probable, however, that the external character of ordinary
                    auditory sensations may be more the result of habit than due to any anatomical
                    peculiarity of the ear itself.</p>
                <p>2. An auditory sensation lasts a short time after the cessation of the exciting
                    cause, so that a number of separate vibrations, each capable of exciting a
                    distinct sensation if heard alone, may succeed each other so rapidly that they
                    are fused into a single sensation. If wo listen to the puffs of a syren, or to
                    vibrating tongues of low pitch, the single sensation is usually produced by
                    about 30 or 35 vibrations per second; but there can be no doubt, as was first
                    pointed out by Helmholtz, that when we listen to beats of considerable
                    intensity, produced by two adjacent tones of sufficiently high pitch, the ear
                    may follow as many as 132 intermissions per second.</p>
                <p>3. The sensibility of the ear for sounds of different pitch is not the same. It
                    is more sensitive for acute than for grave sounds, and it is probable that the
                    maximum degree of acuteness is for sounds produced by about 3000 vibrations per
                    second, that is near ∕α <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> ⅛. Sensibility as to
                    pitch varies much with the individual and with the training to which he has
                    subjected himself. Thus some musicians may detect a difference of <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ ⅛th of the total
                    number of vibrations, while other persons may have difficulty in appreciating a
                    semitone. This power of appreciating differences of pitch is termed a correct or
                    just ear, and there can be no doubt of its improvement by cultivation.</p>
                <p>4. Hearing with two ears does not appear materially to influence auditive
                    sensation, but probably the two organs are enabled, not only to correct each
                    other’s errors, but also to aid us in determining the locality from whence a
                    sound originates. It is asserted by Fechner that one ear may perceive the same
                    tone at a slightly higher pitch than the other, but this may probably be due to
                    some slight pathological condition in one ear. If two tones, produced by two
                    tuning forks of equal pitch, are produced one near each ear, there is a uniform
                    single sensation; if one of the tuning forks be made to revolve round its axis
                    in such a way that its tone increases and diminishes in intensity, neither fork
                    is heard continuously, but both sound alternately, the fixed one being only
                    audible when the revolving one is not. It is difficult to decide whether
                    excitations of corresponding elements in the two ears can be distinguished from
                    each other. It is probable that the resulting sensations may be distinguished,
                    provided one of the generating tones differs from the other in intensity or
                    quality, although it may be the same in pitch.</p>
                <p>5. Hitherto we have considered only the audition of a single sound, but it is
                    possible also to have simultaneous auditive sensations, as in musical harmony.
                    It is difficult to ascertain what is the limit beyond which distinct auditory
                    sensations may be perceived. We have in listening to an orchestra a multiplicity
                    of sensations which produces a total effect, while, at the same time, we can
                    with ease single out and notice attentively the tones of one or two special
                    instruments. Thus the pleasure of music may arise partly from listening to
                    simultaneous, and partly from the effect of contrast or suggestion in passing
                    through successive, auditory sensations.</p>
                <p>The principles of harmony belong to the subject of music, but it is necessary
                    here briefly to refer to these from the physiological point of view. If two
                    musical sounds reach the ear at the same moment, an agreeable or disagreeable
                    sensation is experienced, which may be termed a <hi rend="italic">concord</hi>
                    or a <hi rend="italic">discord,</hi> and it can be shown by experiment with the
                    syren (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics)</hi> that this depends upon the
                    vibrational numbers of the two tones. The octave (1:2), the tλvelfth (1:3), and
                    double octave (1:4), are absolutely consonant sounds; the fifth (2:3) is said to
                    be perfectly consonant; then follow, in the direction of dissonance, the fourth
                    (3: 4), major sixth (3:5), major third (4:5), minor sixth (5:8), and the minor
                    third (5:6). Helmholtz lias attempted to account for this by the application of
                    his theory of <hi rend="italic">beats.</hi></p>
                <p>Beats are observed when two sounds of nearly the same pitch are produced
                    together, and the number of beats per second is equal to the difference of the
                    number of vibrations of the two sounds. Beats give rise to a peculiarly
                    disagreeable intermittent sensation, comparable to what is experienced on
                    watching a flickering light, and the painful sensation may aιise from
                    intermittent irritation of the auditory nerve filaments. The maximum roughness
                    of beats, according to Helmholtz, is attained by 33 per second; beyond 132 per
                    second, the individual impulses are blended into one uniform auditory sensation.
                    When two notes are sounded, say on a piano, not only may the first, fundamental,
                    or prime tones beat, but partial tones of each of the primaries may beat also,
                    and as the difference of pitch of two simultaneous sounds augments, the number
                    of beats, both of prime tones and of harmonics, augments also. The physiological
                    effect of beats, though these may not be individually distinguishable, is to
                    give roughness to the ear. If harmonics or partial tones of prime tones
                    coincide, there are no beats; if they do not coincide, the beats produced will
                    give a character of roughness to the interval. Thus in the octave and twelfth,
                    all the partial tones of the acute sound coincide with the partial tones of the
                    grave sound; in the fourth, major sixth, and major third, only two pairs of the
                    partial tones coincide, while in the minor sixth, minor third, and minor
                    seventh, only one pair of the harmonics coincide. For details, see Helmholtz,

                    They may be got rid by the careful use of injections of soap and hot water. <hi
                    rend="italic">Polypi,</hi> usually hard and firm, but sometimes soft and
                    gelatinous, occur in the external meatus. The external ear may become
                    hypertrophied, as in idiots; it may contain concretions of urate of soda, as in
                    gout; and it may be the seat of fibrous tumours. In the insane, large tumours,
                    filled with blood, termed <hi rend="italic">haematoma,</hi> sometimes occur. One
                    of the most common causes of deafness in children is chronic enlargement of the
                    tonsils from repeated quinseys or from a strumous habit. Frequently also the
                    Eustachian tube is occluded, but by passing a delicate catheter along the tube,
                    and sometimes by inflating artificially the tympanum with air, hearing may be
                    restored. It is difficult to diagnose, and still more difficult to treat,
                    diseases of the internal ear, in consequence of its delicacy of structure and
                    inaccessible situation. Pathological states of the internal ear may give rise to
                    distressing <hi rend="italic">entotic</hi> phenomena, such as whizzing, buzzing,
                    hissing, blowing, or clanging sounds; and if they are not relieved by washing
                    out the external ear, or by inflating the middle ear by the Eustachian tube, or
                    by counter-irritation by means of small blisters or the application of tincture
                    of iodine behind the ears, nothing more can be done. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">g.
