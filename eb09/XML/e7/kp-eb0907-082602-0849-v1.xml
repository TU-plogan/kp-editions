                <p><label type="entry">ELBEUF</label>, a town of France in the department of Seine
                    Inférieure, 13 miles S. of Rouen, on the left bank of the Seine, with a station
                    on the railway between Oissel and Serquigny. It has three parish churches, a
                    Protestant place ot worship, a town-house with a natural history museum, a
                    public library, a hospital, an industrial society, an archaeological society,
                    and a chamber of arts and sciences. The churches of St Etienne and St Jean are
                    both of some antiquity, and preserve stained glass of the 15th and 16th
                    centuries. The town is one of the principal seats of the woollen manufacture in
                    France: more than half of the inhabitants are directly maintained by the staple
                    industry, and numbers more by the auxiliary crafts. As a river-port it has a
                    brisk trade in the produce of the surrounding district as well as in the raw
                    materials of its manufactures. A suspension bridge communicates with St Aubin,
                    and steam-boats ply regularly to Rouen. The population, which was only about
                    4600 in the end of last century, amounted in 1831 to 10,258, and in 1872 to
                    22,563. If the quasisuburban towns of Caudebec-lès-Elbeuf,
                    Saint-Pierre-lès-Elbeuf, and St Aubin-jouxte-Boulleng be included, this great
                    industrial congeries will comprise upwards of 39,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Elbeuf is an old town, and the site was probably occupied during the Roman
                    period. In the 14th century it was made a countship, and in 1554 it passed by
                    marriage to Duke René of Lorraine. By King Henry III. it was raised to the rank
                    of a duchy in favour of Charles, grandson of Claude of Lorraine, but the dukes
                    of Elbeuf made no figure in history, and in 1763 the title passed to the house
                    of Harcourt. The town and its industries were greatly patronized by Colbert; but
                    the revocation of the Edict of Nantes soon after neutralized the beneficial
                    effects of his regulations, and it was not till 1814 that the removal of Belgian
                    competition gave the new impetus which is still at work. In that year there were
