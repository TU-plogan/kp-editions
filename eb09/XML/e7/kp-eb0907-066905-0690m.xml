                    controversy rather than of precise information. The place and even the country
                    in which he was born is the first subject of dispute. A Nubian and an Egyptian
                    origin have both been assigned to him on the basis of a doubtful reading in his
                    work, which speaks of “the Nile of Egypt which cuts our land.” In 1663 Bochart
                    stated that he had found in a manuscript of Leo Africanus that Edrisi was born
                    at Mazara, in Sicily, in 1098. Next year, however, the manuscript was edited by
                    Hottinger, in an appendix to his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecarius Q</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">uadripartitτιs,</hi> and it
                    then appeared that the person supposed to be Edrisi was there named Esseriff
                    Essachalli. Esseriff, or Scheriff, is indeed a usual appellation of Edrisi, but
                    as it is only an honorary title and not a proper name, it does not help the
                    identification. The most positive assertion on the subject is that of Casiri,
                    who says <hi rend="italic">(^Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispanica,</hi> ii. 9), that if
                    Edrisi, as appeared probable, were the person designated by the Mahometan
                    writers as Abu-Abdallah Mohamad Ben Mohamad Ben Abdallah Ben Edris, he was born
                    at Septa, or Ceuta, on the coast of Morocco, in 493 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.h.</hi> (1099 A.D.) Casiri not only qualifies his statement, but he does not
                    mention the authorities from which it is derived; so that its acceptance rests
                    only upon the confidence reposed in his learning and accuracy. Edrisi was long a
                    mighty name in Northern Africa, but in 919 the dynasty was subverted by Mahedi
                    Abdallah, and the proscribed wrecks of the family, according to D’Herbelot,
                    afterwards sought refuge in Sicily. If we may trust the information of Casiri,
                    Edrisi pursued his studies at Cordova, and from the accurate description he has
                    given of Spain, it is probable that he had travelled through a great part of
                    that country. Various circumstances prove that he removed to Sicily, and began
                    to compose his great work under the patronage, and indeed at the express desire,
                    of Roger IL, king of that island. It was completed about <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >548a.h.</hi> (1153 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi></p>
                <p>His work has appeared under various titles. The first and fullest seems to have
                    been, <hi rend="italic">The going out of a Curious Man to explore the Regions of
                    the Globe, its Provinces, Islands, Cities, and their Dinιensions and
                    Situation.</hi> This is sometimes abbreviated. Sionita published it under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Relaxation of the Curious Mind;</hi> but the
                    alternative title of <hi rend="italic">Nubian Geography,</hi> which he and his
                    companion imposed, is altogether arbitrary. It contains a full description of
                    the whole world, as far as it was known to the author, who is said to have
                    received reportsfrom a number of learned explorers despatched expressly to
                    collect information for his use. The world is divided i nto seven <hi
                    rend="italic">climates,</hi> commencing at the equinoctial line, and extending
                    northwards to the limit at which the earth was supposed to be rendered
                    uninhabitable by cold. Each climate is then divided by perpendicular lines into
                    eleven equal parts, beginning with the western coast of Africa and ending with
                    the eastern coast of Asia. The whole world is thus formed into 77 equal square
                    compartments. The geographer begins with the first part of the first climate,
                    including the western part of Central Africa, and proceeds eastward through the
                    different divisions of this climate till he finds its termination in the Sea of
                    China. He then returns to the first part of the second climate, and so proceeds
                    till he ‰eache3 the eleventh part of the seventh climate, which terminates in
                    the north-eastern extremity of Asia. The inconveniences of the arrangement are
                    obvious; but the author appears to have been writing an illustrative treatise to
                    accompany an actual representation of the world which he had engraved on a
                    silver disk or possibly a silver globe.</p>
                <p>Two valuable manuscripts of Edrisi exist in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris,
                    and other two in the Bodleian Library. The first of the Engli h MSS., which was
                    brought over from Egypt by Greaves, is written in the Arabic character peculiar
                    to Northern Africa. It is illustrated by a map of the known world, and by 33
                    other maps, containing each part of a climate, so that there are maps only for
                    the first three climates. The second manuscript, brought by Pococke from Syria,
                    is written in the Arabic character used in that country, and bears the date of
                    906 A.π., or 1500 A.n. It consists of 320 leaves, and is illustrated by one
                    general and 77 particular maps, the latter consequently including all the parts
                    of every climate. The general map was published by Dr Vincent in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Periplus</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Erythraean Sea.</hi> A copy
                    of Edrisi’s work in the Escorial was destroyed by the great fire of 1671.</p>
                <p>The geography of Edrisi, in the original Arabic, was printed at Pome in 1592, at
                    the Mediceau press, from a manuscript preserved in the grand-ducal library at
                    Florence. Both the paper and printing are exceedingly neat, but the volume
                    swarms with typographical errors and forms only a clumsy epitome of the original
                    work. The description of Mecca, which is unaccountably omitted, has been
                    supplied by Pococke from his manuscript. In most bibliographical works this
                    impression has been characterized as one of the rarest of books; but Adler, in a
                    visit to Florence, found in the palace there 1129 copies, which were exposed to
                    sale at a moderate rate. In 1619, two Oriental scholars, Gabriel Sionita and
                    Joannes Hezronita, published at Paris a Latin translation of Edrisi’s work,
                    bearing the title of <hi rend="italic">Geographia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nubiensis;</hi> but it is far from accurate, particularly in the proper names.
                    George Hieronymus Velschius, a German scholar, had prepared a copy of the Arabic
                    original, with a Latin translation, which he purposed to have illustrated with
                    notes; but death prevented the execution of his design, and his manuscript
                    remains deposited in the university library of Jena. Casiri <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bib. Ar. Ηisp.,</hi> ii. 13) mentions that he had determined to re-edit this
                    work, but he appears never to have executed his intention. The part relating to
                    Africa, pre-eminent certainly in point of importance, was very ably edited in
                    1796 by Hartmann, who collected together all the notices relating to each
                    particular countιy, and annexed the statements of the countrymen and
                    contemporaries of Edrisi, so that his work forms nearly a complete body of
                    Arabian geography, as far as relates to Africa. He afterwards published <hi
                    rend="italic">Hispania,</hi> 3 vols., Marburg, 1801-1818.</p>
                <p>A translation into French of the entire work, based on one of the MSS. of the
                    Bibliothèque Nationale, was published by Μ. Jaubertin 1840, and forms volumes v.
                    and vi. of the <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi><hi rend="italic">de Voyages</hi>
                    issued by the Société de Géographie; but a good edition or the original text is
                    still a <hi rend="italic">desideratum.</hi> A number of Oriental scholars at
                    Leyden determined in 1861 to undertake the task: Spain and Western Europe were
                    assigned to Professor Dozy; Eastern Europe aud Western Asia to Doctor Engelmann;
                    Central and Eastern Asia to Defrémery; and Africa to Professor Goeje. The first
                    portion of the work appeared in 1866, under the title or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Afrique et de l’Espagne par Edrisi,
                    texte arabe publié par R.</hi><hi rend="italic">Dozy</hi><hi rend="italic">et Μ.
                    J. de Goeje;</hi> but the other collaborators have hitherto found it impossible
                    to furnish their quota.</p>
