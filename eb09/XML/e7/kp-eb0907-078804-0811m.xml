                    Geheimer Justizrath of Hanover. His health was shattered by an attack of
                    inflammation of the lungs in the year 1825, but he regularly continued his
                    prelections to a large number of students until attacked by fever on the 14th
                    June 1827. He died on the 27th of that month. Eichhorn is the author of a good
                    many historical works, but it is as a biblical critic that he is best known. He
                    may almost be said to have originated the science of biblical criticism, for he
                    first properly recognized its scope and the problems it had to solve, and began
                    many of its most important discussions. He was the first to see the necessity of
                    finding a firm historical foundation for everything in Christianity that was to
                    be accepted as fact. Preliminary to his endeavours towards this end, he took for
                    granted that all the so-called supernatural facts relating to the Old and New
                    Testaments were explicable on natural principles. He sought to judge them from
                    the stand-point of the ancient world, and to account for them by the
                    superstitious beliefs which were then generally in vogue. He did not perceive in
                    the biblical books any religious ideas of much importance for modern times; they
                    interested him merely historically, and for the light they cast upon antiquity.
                    The supernatural element which they contained he attributed partly to the
                    artificial delusions of magic, and partly to the natural delusions of a
                    superstitious time. He regarded as .ungenuine many books of the Old Testament
                    and some of the Epistles, and he was the first to suggest that the Gospels were
                    compiled by later writers from documents which have now perished. He did not
                    appreciate as sufficiently as Strauss and the Tübingen critics the difficulties
                    which a natural theory has to surmount, nor did he support his conclusions by
                    such elaborate and minute discussions as they have deemed necessary, but he may
                    be justly denominated the founder of their school of biblical criticism.</p>
