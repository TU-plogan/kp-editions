                    Woodstock, June 15, 1330. In 1337 he was created duke of Cornwall. He was
                    appointed guardian of the kingdom during the king’s absences in France in 1338,
                    1340, and 1342, and on his return in 1343 was created prince of Wales. In 1346
                    he accompanied his father’s fourth expedition against France, when the division
                    led by him bore the chief brunt in the battle of Crécy. In 1350 ho shared with
                    his father the glory of defeating the Spanish fleet at the battle of
                    “L’Espagnols-sur-Mer.” In 1355 he commanded the principal of the three armies
                    raised by the English for the invasion of France, and landing at Bordeaux
                    captured and plundered the chief of its southern towns and fortresses. In the
                    year following he gained the great victory of Poitiers, and took King John
                    prisoner; and returning to England in 1357, he entered London in triumphant
                    procession, accompanied by his illustrious captive. During the pause of arms
                    which followed the treaty of Bretigny he was married to his cousin Joan,
                    commonly called the Fair Maid of Kent, of whom he was the third husband. This
                    event took place in 1361. Shortly after, he was created duke of Aquitaine, and
                    he set sail for his new dominions in February 1363. Here his life was spent in
                    comparative quietude until Pedro, the deposed monarch of Castile, sought his
                    assistance to remount the Spanish throne. Trusting to Pedro’s promises to defray
                    the cost of the expedition, the Black Prince agreed to his request. He marched
                    across the Pyrenees, defeated Don Henry with great slaughter at the battle of
                    Navarette, and two days afterwards, along with Don Pedro, entered Bourges in
                    triumph. Don Pedro, however, speedily forgot the promise of payment which his
                    distresses had induced him to make, and after the Black Prince had waited some
                    months in vain for its fulfilment, he was compelled to return to his duchy,
                    having lost four-fifths of his army by sickness alone. To defray his expenses he
                    found it necessary to impose on Aquitaine a hearth tax, and the Gascon lords
                    having complained to the king of France, he was summoned in 1369 to Paris to
                    answer the complaint. He replied that he was willing and ready to come, but it
                    would be with “helm on head, and with 60,000 men.” War was consequently again
                    declared between England and France. Two simultaneous invasions of English
                    territory were planned by the French—the one under the duke of Anjou, the other
                    under the duke of Berri. The latter laid* siege to Limoges, which by the
                    treachery of its bishop basely surrendered. Enraged almost to madness, the
                    prince swore by the “soul of his father” that he would recover the city, and
                    after a month’s siege fulfilled his oath. Surprising the garrison by the
                    springing of a mine, he carried the city by assault, and massacred without mercy
                    every man, woman, and child found within its walls. This terrible act of
                    cruelty, attributable, it is <pb break="no"

                    irritation of ill health, and possibly to chagrin arising from the presentiment
                    that the English power in France was now on the wane, is the one blot on his
                    fair fame. It closed also his military career, for he was compelled in 1371, by
                    the advice of his physicians, to return to England. From this time his
                    constitution was utterly broken, but he lingered on to witness the loss of his
                    duchy to England, and also to originate the measures of the “Good Parliament,”
                    although his death prevented their completion. He died at Westminster, 8th June
                    1376. He was buried at Canterbury Cathedral, where his mailed effigy may still
                    be seen.</p>
