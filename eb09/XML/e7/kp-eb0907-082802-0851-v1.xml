                    chancellor of England, was born at Newcastle on the 4th June 1751. His
                    grandfather, William Scott, of Sandgate, a suburb of Newcastle, was clerk to a
                    “fitter ”—a sort of water-carrier and broker of coals. His father, whose name
                    also was William, began life as an apprentice to a fitter, in which service he
                    obtained the freedom of Newcastle, becoming a member of the guild of Hoastmen;
                    later in life he became a principal in the business, and attained a respectable
                    position as a merchant in Newcastle, accumulating property worth nearly £20,000
                    He was twice married; his second wife, the mother of John Scott, says Lord
                    Campbell <hi rend="italic">{Lord Chancellors,</hi> vol. vii. p. 4), “was a woman
                    of such superior understanding, that to her is traced the extraordinary talent
                    which distinguished her two sons, William aud John—Lord Stowell and Lord Eldon.”
                    It may be mentioned that William and John had each of them a twin sister.</p>
                <p>The boys were educated at the grammar school of their native town, where,
                    however, they scarcely gave promise of the splendid careers which they were
                    destined to run. John Scott was not remarkable at school for application to his
                    studies, though his wonderful memory enabled him to make good progress in them;
                    he frequently played truant, and was whipped for it, robbed orchards, and
                    indulged in other questionable school-boy freaks; nor did he always come out of
                    his scrapes with honour and a character for truthfulness. When John had finished
                    his education at the grammar school, his father thought of apprenticing him to
                    his own business, to which an elder brother Henry had already devoted himself;
                    and it was only through the interference of William, who had already obtained a
                    fellowship at University College, Oxford, that it was ultimately resolved that
                    he should continue the prosecution of his studies. Accordingly, on the 15th May
                    1766, John Scott entered University College as a commoner, with the view of
                    entering the church, and obtaining a college living. In the year following he
                    obtained a fellowship, graduated B.A. in 1770, and in 1771 won the prize for the
                    English essay, the only university prize open in his time for general
                    competition. It does not appear, however, that he distinguished himself at
                    college any more than he had done at school by any severe application to study.
                    It was not till after his marriage that he first concentrated his energies on
                    the congenial study of law.</p>
                <p>His wife was the eldest daughter of Mr Aubone Surtees, a Newcastle banker. John
                    Scott first met her at Sedgefield Church, in the county of Durham, and a strong
                    attachment sprang up between them. The Surtees family objected to the match, and
                    attempted to prevent it; but the fire once kindled was not to be put out. On the
                    18th November 1772, Scott, with the aid of a ladder and an old friend, carried
                    off the lady from her father’s house in the Sandhill, across the border to
                    Blackshiels, in Scotland, where they were married. The father of the bridegroom
                    objected not to his son’s choice, but to the time he chose to marry; for it was
                    a blight on his son’s prospects, depriving him of his fellowship and his chance
                    of church preferment. But while the bride’s family refused to hold intercourse
                    with the pair, Mr Scott, like a prudent man and an affectionate father, set
                    himself "to make the best of a bad matter, and received them kindly, settling on
                    his son .£2000. John returned with his wife to Oxford, and continued to hold his
                    fellowship for what is called the year of grace given after marriage, and added
                    to his income by acting as a private tutor. After a time Mr Surtees was
                    reconciled with his daughter, and made a liberal settlement on her. John Scott’s
                    year of grace closed without any college living falling vacant; and with his
                    fellowship he gave up the church, and turned to the study of law. He became a
                    student at the Middle Temple in January 1773, and in February took his degree of
                    M.A. at Oxford. In 1776 he was called to the bar, intending at first to
                    establish himself as an advocate in his native town, a scheme which his early
                    success led him to abandon, and he soon settled to the practice of his
                    profession in London, and on the Northern Circuit. Thus, at last, had he started
                    on the high road to the chancellorship, having narrowly escaped becoming a
                    coal-fitter, a country parson, a provincial barrister, and, according to one
                    account, a retailer of figs and raisins.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0852-0829"/>
                <p>In the autumn of the year in which he was called to the bar his father died,
                    leaving him a legacy of &lt;£1000 over and above the £2000 previously settled on
                    him. He was already an excellent lawyer, and succeeded fairly well on his first
                    circuit, though not so well as to satisfy him of the safety of attempting a
                    London career. He therefore took a house in Newcastle, with the view of
                    establishing himself there, but still delayed to leave London; and his prospects
                    there suddenly improving, he assigned the Newcastle house to his brother Henry.
                    In his second year at the bar his prospects began to brighten. His brother
                    William, who by this time held the Camden professorship of ancient history, and
                    enjoyed an extensive acquaintance with men of eminence in London, was in a
                    position materially to advance his interests. Among his friends was the
                    notorious Bowes of Gibside, to the patronage of whose house the rise of the
                    Scott family was largely owing. Bowes having contested Newcastle and lost it,
                    presented an election petition against the return of his opponent. Young Scott
                    was retained as junior counsel in the case, and though he lost the petition he
                    did not fail to improve the opportunity which it afforded for displaying his
                    talents. This engagement, in the commencement of his second year at the bar, and
                    the dropping in of occasional fees, must have raised his hopes; and he now
                    abandoned the scheme of becoming a provincial barrister. A year or two of dull
                    drudgery and few fees followed, and lie began to be much depressed. But in 1780
                    we find his prospects suddenly improved, by his appearance in the case of
                    Ackroyd <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Smithson, which became a leading case settling
                    a rule of law; and young Scott, having lost his point in the inferior court,
                    insisted on arguing it, on appeal, against the opinion of his clients, and
                    carried it before Lord Thurlow, whose favourable consideration he won by his
                    able argument. The same year Bowes again retained him in an election petition;
                    and in the year following Scott greatly increased his reputation by his
                    appearance as leading counsel in the Clitheroe election petition. From this time
                    his success was certain. In two years he obtained a silk gown, and was so far
                    cured of his early modesty that he declined accepting the king’s counselship if
                    precedence over him were given to his junior, Mr Erskine, though the latter was
                    the son of a peer and a most accomplished orator. He was now on the high way to
                    fortune. His health, which had hitherto been but indifferent, strengthened with
                    the demands made upon it; his .talents, his power of endurance, and his ambition
                    all expanded together. He enjoyed a considerable practice in the northern part
                    of his circuit, before parliamentary committees, and at the Chancery bar, and
                    was in sight of the honours and emoluments of the solicitor and attorney
                    generalships. By 1787 his practice at the Equity bar had so far increased that
                    he was obliged to give up the eastern half of his circuit (which embraced six
                    counties), and attend it only at Lancaster.</p>
                <p>Shortly after taking the silk gown, he entered Parliament for Lord Weymouth’s
                    close borough of Weobley, which Lord Thurlow obtained for him without
                    solicitation. In Parliament he gave a general and independent support to Pitt.
                    His first parliamentary speeches were directed against Fox’s India Bill. They
                    were unsuccessful. In one he aimed at being brilliant; and becoming merely
                    laboured and pedantic, he was covered with ridicule by Sheridan, from whom he
                    received a lesson which he did not fail to turn to account. In 1788 Pitt
                    conferred upon him the honour of knighthood and the office of solicitorgeneral;
                    and at the close of this year he attracted attention by his speeches in support
                    of Pitt’s resolutions on the state of the king (George III., who then laboured
                    under a mental malady) and the delegation of his authority. It is said that he
                    drew the Regency Bill, which was introduced in 1789. In 1793 Sir John Scott was
                    promoted to the office of attorney-general, in which it fell to him to conduct
                    the memorable prosecutions for high treason against British sympathizers with
                    French republicanism,—amongst others, against the celebrated Horne Tooke. These
                    prosecutions, in most cases, were no doubt instigated by Sir John Scott, and
                    were the most important proceedings in which he was ever professionally engaged.
                    He has left on record, in his <hi rend="italic">Anecdote Book,</hi> a defence of
                    his conduct in regard to them. A full account of the principal trials, and of
                    the various legislative measures for repressing the expressions of popular
                    opinion for which he wasjnore or less responsible, will be found in Twiss’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Public and Private Life of the Lord Chancellor Eldon,</hi> and
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Lord Chancellors,</hi> by Lord Campbell.
                    In 1799 the office of chief-justice of the Court of Common Pleas falling vacant,
                    Sir John Scott’s claim to it was not overlooked; and after seventeen years’
                    service in the Lower House, he entered the House of Peers as Baron Eldon. In
                    February 1801, the ministry of Pitt was succeeded by that of Addington, and the
                    chief-justice now ascended the woolsack. The chancellorship was given to him
                    professedly on account of his notorious anti-Catholic zeal. From the Peace of
                    Amiens (1801) till 1804, Lord Eldon appears to have interfered little in
                    politics. In the latter year we find him conducting the negotiations which
                    resulted in the dismissal of Addington and the recall of Pitt to office as prime
                    minister. Lord Eldon was continued in office as chancellor under Pitt; but the
                    new administration was of short duration, for on the 23d of January 1806 Pitt
                    died, worn out with the anxieties of office, and his ministry was succeeded by a
                    coalition, under Lord Grenville. The death of Fox, who became foreign secretary
                    and leader of the House of Commons, soon, however, broke up the Grenville
                    administration; and in the spring of 1807, Lord Eldon once more, under Lord
                    Liverpool’s administration, returned to the woolsack, which, from that time, he
                    continued to occupy for about twenty years, swaying the Cabinet, and being in
                    all but name prime minister of England. It was not till April 1827, when the
                    premiership, vacant through the paralysis of Lord Liverpool, fell to Mr Canning,
                    the chief advocate of Roman Catholic emancipation, that Lord Eldon, in the
                    seventy-sixth year of his age, finally resigned the chancellorship. When, after
                    the two short administrations of Canning and Goderich, it fell to the duke of
                    Wellington to construct a Cabinet, Lord Eldon expected to be included, if not as
                    chancellor, at least in some important office, but he was overlooked, at which
                    he was much chagrined. Notwithstanding his frequent protests that he did not
                    covet power, but longed for retirement, we find him again, so late as 1835,
                    within three years of his death, in hopes of office under Peel. He spoke in
                    Parliament for the last time in July 1834.</p>
                <p>In 1821 Lord Eldon had been created earl by George IV., whom he managed to
                    conciliate, partly, no doubt, by espousing his cause agaiust his wife, whose
                    advocate he had formerly been, and partly through his reputation for zeal
                    against the Roman Catholics. In the same year, his brother William, who from
                    1798 had filled the office of judge of the High Court of Admiralty, was raised
                    to the peerage under the title of Lord Stowell.</p>
                <p>Lord Eldon’s wife, his dear “Bessy,” his love for whom is a beautiful feature in
                    his life, died before him, on the 28th June 1831. By nature she was of simple
                    character, and by habits acquired during the early portion of her husband’s
                    career almost a recluse. Two of their sons reached maturity,—John, who died in
                    1805, and William Henry John, who died unmarried in 1832. Lord Eldon himself
                    survived almost all his immediate relations. His brother William died in 1836,
                    He him <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n853/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0853-0830"/> self died, in London, in his eighty-seventh
                    year, on the 13th January 1838, leaving behind him two daughters, Lady Frances
                    Bankes and Lady Elizabeth Repton, and his grandson, who succeeded him. “When his
                    remains lay in state in Hamilton Place,” says Lord Campbell, “large numbers of
                    all classes went to see the solemn scene; and when the funeral procession,
                    attended by the carriages of the princes of the blood, many members of the
                    peerage, and all the dignitaries of the law, blackened the way, dense crowds
                    stood uncovered, respectfully gazing at it as it passed.” His remains were
                    interred in the family vault in the chapel of Kingston, in Dorsetshire. The
                    fortune which he left behind him exceeded in amount half a million of money.</p>
                <p>Lord Eldon was no legislator,—his one aim in politics was to keep in office, and
                    maintain things as he found them; and almost the only laws he helped to pass
                    were laws for popular coercion. For nearly forty years he fought against every
                    improvement in law, or in the constitution,—calling God to witness, on the
                    smallest proposal of reform, that he foresaw from it the downfall of his
                    country. Without any political principles, properly so called, and without
                    iuterest in or knowledge of foreign affairs, he maintained himself and his party
                    in power for an unprecedented period by his great tact, and in virtue of his two
                    great political properties—of zeal against every species of reform, and zeal
                    against the Roman Catholics. To pass from his political to his judicial
                    character is to shift to ground on which his greatness is universally
                    acknowledged. His judgments, which have received as much praise for their
                    accuracy as abuse for their clumsiness and uncouthness, fill a small library.
                    But though intimately acquainted with every nook and cranny of the English law,
                    he never carried his studies into foreign fields, from which to enrich our legal
                    literature; and it must be added that against the excellence of his judgments,
                    in too many cases, must be set off the hardships, worse than injustice, that
                    arose from his protracted delays in pronouncing them. A consummate judge and the
                    narrowest of politicians, he was Doubt on the bench and Promptness itself in the
                    political arena. For literature, as for art, he had no feeling. What intervals
                    of leisure he enjoyed from the cares of office he filled up with newspapers and
                    the gossip of old cronies. Nor were his intimate associates men of refinement
                    and taste; they were rather good fellows who quietly enjoyed a good bottle and a
                    joke; he uniformly avoided encounters of wit with his equals. He is said to have
                    been parsimonious, and certainly he was quicker to receive than to reciprocate
                    hospitalities; but his mean establishment and mode of life are explained by the
                    retired habits of his wife, and her dislike of company. His manners were very
                    winning and courtly, and in the circle of his immediate relatives he is said to
                    have always been lovable and beloved. “He is one,” says Miss Martineau, “that
                    after times will not venerate; but fortunately for the fame of the larger number
                    of the great ones of the earth, there is a vast neutral ground between
                    veneration and contempt.”</p>
                <p>“In his person,” says Lord Campbell, “Lord Eldon was about the middle size, his
                    figure light and athletic, his features regular and handsome, his eye bright and
                    full, his smile remarkably benevolent, and his whole appearance prepossessing.
                    The advance of years rather increased than detracted from these personal
                    advantages. As he sat on the judgment-seat, ‘ the deep thought betrayed in his
                    furrowed brow,—the large eyebrows, overhanging eyes that seemed to regard more
                    what was taking place within than around him,—his calmness, that would have
                    assumed a character of sternness but for its perfect placidity,—his dignity,
                    repose, and venerable age, tended at once to win confidence and to inspire
                    respect ’ (Townsend). He had a voice both sweet and deep-toned, and its effect
                    was not injured by his Northumbrian burr, which, though strong, was entirely
                    free from harshness and vulgarity.”</p>
