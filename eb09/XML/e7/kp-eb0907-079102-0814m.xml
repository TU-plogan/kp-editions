                    rend="italic">Eisteddfodau),</hi> the national bardic congress of Wales, the
                    objects of which are to encourage bardism and music and the general literature
                    of the Welsh, to maintain the Welsh language and customs of the country, and to
                    foster and cultivate a patriotic spirit amongst the people. This institution, so
                    peculiar to Wales, is of very ancient origin.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to the Welsh Triads and other
                    historical records, the <hi rend="italic">Gorsedd</hi> or assembly (an essential
                    part of the modern Eisteddfod, from which indeed the latter sprung) is as old at
                    least as the time of Prydain the son of Aedd the Great, who lived many centuries
                    before the Christian era. Upon the destruction of the political ascendency of
                    the Druids, the Gorsedd lost its political importance, though it seems to have
                    long afterwards retained its institutional character as the medium for
                    preserving the laws, doctrines, and traditions of bardism.</p></note> The term
                    <hi rend="italic">Eisteddfod,</hi> however, which means “a session” or
                    “sitting,” was probably not applied to bardic congresses before the 12th
                    century.</p>
                <p>The Eisteddfod in its present character appears to have originated in the time of
                    0wain ap Maxen Wledig, who at the close of the 4th century was elected to the
                    chief sovereignty of the Britons on the departure of the Romans. It was at this
                    time, or soon afterwards, that the laws and usages of the Gorsedd were codified
                    and remodelled, and its motto of “Y gwir yn erbyn y byd” (The truth against the
                    world) given to it. “Chairs” (with which the Eisteddfod as a national
                    institution is now inseparably connected) were also established, or rather
                    perhaps resuscitated about the same time. The chair was a kind of convention
                    where disciples were trained, and bardic matters discussed preparatory to the
                    great Gorsedd, each chair having a distinctive motto. There are now existing
                    four chairs in Wales,— namely, the “royal” chair of Powys, whose motto is “A
                    laddo a leddir” (He that slayeth shall be slain); that of Gwent and Glamorgan,
                    whose motto is “Duw a phob daioni” (God and all goodness); that of Dyfed, whose
                    motto is “Calon wrtlι galon,” (Heart with heart); and that of Gwynedd, or North
                    Wales, whose motto is“Iesu,” or “0 Iesu! na’d gamwaith” (Jesus, or Oh Jesus!
                    suffer not iniquity).</p>
                <p>The first Eisteddfod of which any account seems to have descended to us was one
                    held on the banks of the Conway in the 6th century, under the auspices of
                    Maelgwn Gwynedd, prince of North Wales. Maelgwn on this occasion, in order to
                    prove the superiority of vocal song over instrumental music, is recorded to have
                    offered a reward to such bards and minstrels as should swim over the Conway.
                    There were several competitors, but on their arrival on the opposite shore, the
                    harpers found themselves unable to play, owing to the injury their harps had
                    sustained from the water, while the bards were in as good tune as ever. King
                    Cadwaladr also presided at an Eisteddfod about the middle of the 7th
                    century.</p>
                <p>Griffith ap Cynan, prince of North Wales, who had been born in Ireland, brought
                    with him from that country many Irish musicians, who greatly improved the music
                    of Wales. During his long reign of 56 years he offered great encouragement to
                    bards, harpers, and minstrels, and framed a code of laws for their better
                    regulation. He held an Eisteddfod about the beginning of the 12th century at
                    Caerwys in Flintshire, “to which there repaired all the musicians of Wales, and
                    some also from England and Scotland.” For many years afterwards the Eisteddfod
                    appears to have been held triennially, and to have enforced the rigid observance
                    of the enactments of Griffith ap Cynan. The places at which it was generally
                    held were Aberffraw, formerly the royal seat of the princes of North Wales;
                    Dynevor, the royal castle of the princes of South Wales; and Mathrafal, the
                    royal palace of the princes of Powys; and in later times Caerwys in Flintshire
                    received that honourable distinction, it having been the princely residence of
                    Llewelyn the Last. Some of these Eisteddfodaιι were conducted in a style of
                    great magnificence, under the patronage of the native princes. At Christmas
                    1107, Cadwgan, the son of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, prince of Powys, held an Eisteddfod
                    in Cardigan Castle, to which he invited the bards, harpers, and minstrels, “the
                    best to be found in all Wales;” and “he gave them chairs and subjects of
                    emulation according to the custom of the feasts of King Arthur.” In 1176 Rhys ab
                    Gruffydd, prince of South Wales, held an Eisteddfod in the same castle on a
                    scale of still greater magnificence, it having been proclaimed, we are told, a
                    year before it took place, “over Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland, and many
                    other countries.”</p>
                <p>On the annexation of Wales to England, Edward I. deemed it politic to sanction
                    the bardic Eisteddfod by his famous statute of Rhuddlan. In the reign of Edward
                    III. Ifor Hael, a South Wales chieftain, held one at his mansion. Another was
                    held in 1451, with the permission of the king, by Griffith ab Nicholas at
                    Carmarthen, in princely style, where Dafydd ab Edmund, an eminent poet,
                    signalized himself by his wonderful powers of versification in the Welsh metres,
                    and whence “he carried home on his shoulders the silver chair” which he had
                    fairly won. Several Eisteddfodau were held, one at least by royal mandate, in
                    the reign of Henry VII. In 1523 one was held at Caer-λvys before the chamberlain
                    of North Wales and others, by virtue of a commission issued by Henry VIII. In
                    the course of time, through relaxation of bardic discipline, the profession was
                    assumed by unqualified persons, to the great detriment of the regular bards.
                    Accordingly in 1567 Queen Elizabeth issued a commission for holding an
                    Eisteddfod at Caerwys in the following year, which was duly-held, when degrees
                    were conferred on 55 candidates, including 20 harpers. From the terms of the
                    royal proclamation we find that it was then customary to bestow “a silver harp”
                    on the chief of the faculty of musicians, as it had been usual to reward the
                    chief bard with “a silver chair.” This was the last Eisteddfod appointed by
                    royal commission, but several others of some importance were held during the
                    16th and 17th centuries, under the patronage of the earl of Pembroke, Sir
                    Richard Neville, and other influential persons. Amongst these the last of any
                    particular note was one held in Bewper Castle, Glamorgan, by Sir Richard Basset
                    in 1681.</p>
                <p>During the succeeding 130 years Welsh nationality was at its lowest ebb, and no
                    general Eisteddfod on a large scale appears to have been held until 1819, though
                    several <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0815-0792"/> small ones were held under the auβpices of the
                    Gwyned∙ digion Society, established in 1771,—the most important being those at
                    Corwen (1789), St Asaph (1790), and Caerwys (1798).</p>
                <p>At the close of the Napoleonic wars, however, there was a general revival of
                    Welsh nationality, and numerous Welsh literary societies were established
                    throughout Wales, and in the principal English towns. A large Eisteddfod was
                    held under distinguished patronage at Carmarthen in 1819, and from that time to
                    the present they have been held, almost without intermission, annually, several
                    of them being under royal patronage. The following is a list of the principal
                    Eisteddfodau since that date:—</p>
                <p>1820, Wrexham; 1821, Carnarvon; 1822, Brecon; 1823, Carmarthen; 1824, Welshpool;
                    1826, Brecon; 1828, Denbigh; 1832, Beaumaris; 1834, Cardiff; 1835,
                    Llanerchymedd; 1836, Liverpool; 1838, Merthyr; 1839, Liverpool; 1840,
                    Abergavenny; 1842,. Swansea; 1845, Abergavenny; 1849, Aberffraw; 1850, Rhuddlan;
                    1851, Tremadoc; 1853, Liverpool and Portmadoc; 1854, Festiniog; 1855, Dinas
                    Mawddwy, Machraeth, and Morriston; 1858, Llangollen (memorable for its archaic
                    character, and the attempts then made to revive the ancient ceremonies and
                    restore the ancient vestments of druids, bards, and ovates); 1859, Merthyr;
                    1860, Denbigh; 1861, Conway and Aberdare; 1862, Carnarvon; 1863, Swansea and
                    Rhyl; 1864, Llandudno; 1865, Aberystwith; 1866, Chester; 1867,Carmarthen; 1868,
                    Ruthin; 1869, Llanerchymedd; 1870, Rhyl; 1871, Towyn; 1872, Portmadoc; 1873,
                    Mold; 1874, Bangor; 1875, Pwllheli; 1876, Wrexham; and 1877, Carnarvon.</p>
                <p>Besides these, innumerable local Eisteddfodau have been been held during the last
                    50 years.</p>
                <p>To constitute a provincial Eisteddfod it is necessary that it should be
                    proclaimed by a graduated bard of a Gorsedd a year and a day'before it takes
                    place. A local one may be held without such a proclamation. A provincial
                    Eisteddfod generally lasts three, sometimes four days, during which thousands of
                    persons of all classes and from all parts of Wales and many English towns
                    attend. Many of these being unacquainted with the Welsh language, a large'
                    portion of the public proceedings are conducted in English. A president and a
                    conductor are appointed for each day. The proceedings commence with a Gorsedd
                    meeting, opened -with sound of trumpet and other ceremonies, at which candidates
                    come forward and receive bardic degrees after satisfying the presiding bard as
                    to their fitness. At the subsequent meetings the president gives a brief
                    addres3; the bards follow with poetical addresses; adjudications are made, and
                    prizes and medals with suitable devices are given to the successful competitors
                    for poetical, musical, and prose compositions, for the best choral and solo
                    singing, and singing with the harp or “Pennillion singing"<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Jones’s <hi rend="italic">Bardic
                    Remains,</hi> “To sing ‘Pennillion’ with a Welsh harp is not so easily
                    accomplished as may be imagined. The singer is obliged to follow the harper, who
                    may change the tune, or perform variations <hi rend="italic">ad libitum,</hi>
                    whilst the vocalist must keep time, and end precisely with the strain. The
                    singer does not commence with the harper, but takes the strain up at the second,
                    third, or fourth bar, as best suits the ‘ pennill ’ he intends to sing. . . .
                    Those are considered the best singers who can adapt stanzas of various metres to
                    one melody, and who are acquainted with the twenty-four measures according to
                    the bardic laws and rules of composition”</p></note> as it is called, for the
                    best playing on the harp or stringed or wind instruments, as well as
                    occasionally for the best specimens of handicraft and art. In the evening of
                    each day a concert is given, generally attended by very large numbers. The great
                    day of the Eisteddfod is the “chair” day—usually the third or last day—the grand
                    event of the Eisteddfod being the adjudication on the chair subject and the
                    chairing and investiture of the fortunate winner. This is the highest object of
                    a Welsh bard’s ambition. The ceremony is an imposing one, and is performed with
                    sound of trumpet. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Celtic Literature,</hi> vol. v. pp.
