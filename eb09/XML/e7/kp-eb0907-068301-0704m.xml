                    other proof than the fate which finally overtook him. His first acts after the
                    death of his father foreshadowed his future career. He at once recalled Piers
                    Gaveston, a favourite whom his father had banished from the court, and created
                    him earl of Cornwall, caused his father’s body to be buried at Westminster, and,
                    after rejoining the army for a few days, returned again to London, and for six
                    years made no serious effort to prosecute the war with Scotland. Previous to his
                    coronation he went to France to be married to Isabella, daughter of Philip II.;
                    and by appointing Gaveston guardian of the kingdom during his absence, and
                    loading him with honours and presents on his return, he roused the animosity of
                    the nobles to such a height that it was only on his promising to agree to
                    certain demands that might be submitted to him at a future Parliament, that they
                    consented to his coronation. It took place 25th February 1308. Until the nobles
                    rose in rebellion in 1312, and executed Gaveston at Warwick castle, the
                    favourite formed a perpetual subject of dispute between the nobles and the king,
                    and was alternately banished and recalled according to the king’s exigencies. In
                    1311 Parliament confirmed the report of the “Committee of Ordinances” appointed
                    to reform the abuses of the administration. The king nominally agreed to act in
                    accordance with the report, but by a saving clause secured to himself full
                    liberty to evade the principal enactments, the result of which was a series of
                    quarrels with the nobles, becoming more serious each successive time, followed
                    by reconciliations increasing gradually in hollowness till the end of his reign.
                    Robert Bruce took full advantage of the internal difficulties of England, and in
                    1314 had reconquered the principal strongholds of Scotland with the exception of
                    Stirling castle. For its relief Edward raised an army of 100,000 men, but
                    suffered a ruinous defeat at the battle of Bannockburn, 24th June 1314. Edward
                    made no further effort of importance against the Scots till 1319, when he
                    besieged Berwick, which Bruce had taken, but was compelled to raise the siege,
                    and concluded a two years’ truce with Scotland. After the death of Piers
                    Gaveston, the place of favourite with the king was occupied by Hugh Despenser.
                    He was banished by Parliament in 1321, but soon returned; and, provoked at this,
                    the barons under Lancaster declared war, but were defeated and Lancaster
                    executed in March 1322. In 1323 a fourteen years’ truce was concluded with
                    Scotland. In 1324 Edward was persuaded to send the queen to France in order to
                    settle some disputes with the French king. She succeeded in her mission, but
                    refused to return home, on account, she affirmed, of previous ill-treatment by
                    her husband, although doubtless intrigues with Roger Mortimer had something to
                    do with her refusal. From France she went to Flanders, and, raising a small army
                    against the king, landed at Orwell in Suffolk, 22d September 132G. The whole
                    nation flocked to her standard, Despenser was executed, and young Edward was
                    appointed guardian of the kingdom. In 1327, the king was formally deposed by
                    Parliament, and his son elected in his stead. A plot was formed against the
                    deposed monarch in the same year, and he was murdered with great cruelty at
                    Berkeley Castle on the 27th September. (See the same writers for this reign as
                    for the last.)</p>
