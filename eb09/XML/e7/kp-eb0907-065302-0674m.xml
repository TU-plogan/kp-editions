                    the daughter, by his first wife, of Richard Lovell Edgeworth noticed below. She
                    was born at Hare Hatch, Berkshire, in 1767, and did not see Ireland till she was
                    twelve years old. She was educated by her father, who devoted himself with great
                    enthusiasm to the intellectual advancement of his children. In most of her
                    literary undertakings Miss Edgeworth had the advantage of her father’s
                    criticism, who also wrote introductions to her novels. “It is my business,” he
                    used to say, “to cut and correct: yours to write on.” Many tales and essays were
                    written by Maria for private pleasure before publication was thought of. <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Education</hi> (1798) was a joint work by father and
                    daughter. In 1800 appeared <hi rend="italic">Castle Rackrent,</hi> which at once
                    made for her a reputation as a national novelist. This was followed soon after
                    by <hi rend="italic">Belinda,</hi> and by the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Irish
                    Bulls,</hi> published in partnership •with her father, and intended to
                    familiarize the English public with Irish humour and pathos. The work is so
                    thoroughly the joint-product of two minds, that Miss Edgeworth, in writing her
                    father’s life, cannot tell distinctly which parts are his, but says that
                    passages in which classical allusions and quotations occur must be her father’s,
                    as she was “entirely ignorant of the learned languages” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Memoirs,</hi> second edition, ii. 315). In 1804 appeared <hi rend="italic"
                    >Popular Tales;</hi> in 1806 <hi rend="italic">Leonora;</hi> in 1809 the first
                    instalment of <hi rend="italic">Fashionable Tales,</hi> which were finished in
                    1812; in 1814 <hi rend="italic">Patronage;</hi> and in 1817 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harrington, Ormond,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Comic Dramas,</hi> which failed
                    on the stage. The death of her father, in that year, recalled her from novel
                    writing to fulfil the sacred duty of completing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs,</hi> which were given to the world in 1820, and of which a second
                    edition was called for in 1821. In 1822 appeared <hi rend="italic">Rosamond, a
                    Sequel to Early Lessons,</hi> a work published earlier with contributions from
                    Mr Edgeworth’s pen. In August 1823 Miss Edgeworth visited Sir Walter Scott at
                    Abbotsford, where she remained a fortnight; and Scott repaid this visit at
                    Edgeworthtown exactly two years afterwards. In 1825 Miss Edgeworth further
                    continued her tales for the young by the publication of <hi rend="italic">Harry
                    and L·ucy.</hi> In 1834 appeared <hi rend="italic">Helen, a Tale,</hi> her last
                    and one of her best novels;' and she afterwards wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlandino,</hi> a book for children. Her <hi rend="italic">Letters for Literary
                    Ladies</hi> were suggested by a correspondence between Thomas Day and her father
                    as to the propriety of “female authorship,” in which the former stoutly
                    maintained the negative.</p>
                <p>Miss Edgeworth died on the 21st of May 1849, after having lived to see her works
                    take rank as English classics. Her influence was deep and lasting. Sir Walter
                    Scott confesses that he was anxious to do for Scotland what Miss Edgeworth had
                    done for Ireland; and it is said that O’Connell regretted deeply that one so
                    powerful did not servo Ireland as an agitator. Her society was courted by <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0675-0654"/> the most distinguished of her contemporaries; and
                    countless tourists, who visited her, returned home charmed by her lively
                    conversation and by the domestic virtues which brightened the home of which she
                    was the centre. With Scott she was on terms of the closest intimacy; Byron
                    admired her works, in spite of his sarcastic reference to “Miss Edgeworth’s
                    novels stepping from their covers;” and Lord Macaulay was one of her most
                    enthusiastic worshippers. “Among all the incidents,” says Mr Trevelyan,
                    “connected with the publication of his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> nothing
                    pleased Macaulay so much as the gratification that he contrived to give to Maria
                    Edge worth, as a small return for the enjoyment which, during more than forty
                    years, he had derived from her charming writings.” Macaulay mentions Miss
                    Edgeworth’s name in a note, in which he describes her delineation of King Corny,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Ormond,</hi> as “that admirable portrait.” Miss Edgeworth,
                    in a letter to Dr Holland, speaks of the “self-satisfaction, vanity, pride,
                    surprise, I had in finding my own name in a note.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Castle Rackrent,</hi> the first and one of the most
                    characteristic of her novels, is lit up throughout with sunny Irish humour, Sir
                    Condy complaining that he “was very ill used by the Government about a place
                    that was promised him and never given, after his supporting them against his
                    conscience very honourably” (1857 edition, p. 39). <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leonora</hi> has a painful plot. It treats of the seduction of an attached
                    husband by a professed friend of his wife. Leonora’s forbearance, however, and
                    her deep-seated love for her husband prove, in the end, too much for the hollow
                    professions and vaunted “sensibility” of Olivia. The <hi rend="italic">Tales of
                    Fashionable Life</hi> include <hi rend="italic">Ennui, The Dun, Manoeuvring,
                    Almeria, Vivian, The Absentee, Madame de Fleury,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Émilie de Coulanges.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ennui</hi> is a powerful story, and
                    relates how the earl of Glenthorn was cured of the disease which gives its name
                    to the book. There are several fine character studies, including the Earl; M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> Leod, the cool, but faithful, Scotch agent; witty
                    Lady Geraldine; Christy, the blacksmith; and Ellinor, the Irish foster nurse,
                    who said, on one occasion, that “if it <hi rend="italic">plased</hi> God, she
                    would like to die on a Christmas day, of all days, <hi rend="italic"
                    >becaase</hi> the gates of Heaven, they say, will be open all that day, and who
                    knows but a body might slip in <hi rend="italic">unknowηst ?”</hi> (1857
                    edition, p. 231). <hi rend="italic">The Dun</hi> portrays, with a realism almost
                    too painful, the dreadful privations undergone by the poor who are unable to get
                    in the money justly their due. <hi rend="italic">Manoeuvring</hi> depicts the
                    efforts of Mrs Beaumont, a clever, scheming, deceitful woman, to marry her son
                    and daughter contrary to their inclinations. For a while all seems to go well
                    with Mrs Beaumont, until she is herself entangled in her net of white lies, and
                    finally thoroughly outwitted. Her character, and that of Mr Palmer, a wealthy
                    merchant from Jamaica,· are worthy of the author’s high reputation. <hi
                    rend="italic">Almeria</hi> traces the rise of the worldly spirit in the breast
                    of a young girl, and the debasing consequences of a passionate pursuit of
                    fashion for its own sake, unredeemed by any ennobling feature. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vivian</hi> is an admirably told story, and illustrates the terrible evils
                    which sometimes arise from indecision of character. Vivian, the undecided,
                    brilliant, young noble; Russell, the faithful tutor; Wharton, the unscrupulous
                    politician and voluptuary; self-willed Lord Glistonbury; prim Lady Glistonbury;
                    and vivacious Lady Julia seem to start from the canvas. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Absentee,</hi> considered by many as Miss Edgeworth’s masterpiece, is written to
                    expose the misery entailed on the tenantry by the Irish gentry, who deserted
                    their native country for London, and abandoned their affairs to be managed by
                    unscrupulous agents. The characters are among the most life-like in the annals
                    of fiction. Lady Clonbrony makes herself exquisitely ridiculous in her vain
                    endeavours to act the fine English lady; Lord Colambre, the hero of the novel,
                    travels, under an assumed name, among bis father’s tenants in Ireland, finds out
                    how rudely they have been oppressed, and champions their cause so skilfully as
                    to win over even Lady Clonbrony; Lady Dashfort and her daughter are wonderfully
                    real representations of heartless women of fashion; the sufferings of the Irish
                    peasantry are drawn with a loving and masterly pencil; and the general sadness
                    of the work is relieved by such humorous sketches as Colonel Heathcock, Sir
                    Terence O’Fay, and Larry Brady, whose inimitable letter closes the book.
                    Macaulay considered the scene in which Lord Colambre discovers himself to his
                    father’s tenantry the best passage of the kind since the beginning of the 22d
                    book of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> This is very high praise, especially
                    when we remember that Macaulay seems to have read almost every novel—so much was
                    he fascinated by narrative composition. <hi rend="italic">Madame de Fleury</hi>
                    is the story of a French lady who set up a school in Paris for neglected girls.
                    The school came to grief at the great Revolution; and its benevolent founder had
                    to fly to England, where she was supported mainly by donations from the girls,
                    who were instigated by Victoire, the heroine of the book. Ultimately her return
                    to France was secured by Basile, Victoire’s lover, who had obtained influence
                    with his general through his valuable engineering knowledge. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emilie de Coulanges</hi> describes the mortifications two French refugees had
                    to undergo in living with Mrs Somers, an excessively ill-tempered English lady,
                    who was generous enough with her money, but neglectful of kindness of a more
                    delicate order. Mrs Somers’s incessant outbursts of temper and reconciliations
                    with Emilie, to be followed inevitably by fresh quarrels, are somewhat wearisome
                    reading. <hi rend="italic">The Modern Griselda,</hi> a story treating of the
                    attempts of a wife to bring her husband to abject submission, manifests fine
                    satiric power, and great liveliness—thedialogue being particularly animated. <hi
                    rend="italic">Patronage,</hi> which is in the same vein as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tales of Fashionable Life,</hi> rather disappointed the critics, who concluded
                    that Mr Edgeworth had written considerable parts of it. This, however, is
                    expressly denied by Miss Edgeworth (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> ii. 323).
                    <hi rend="italic">Ormond</hi> is an Irish tale, and ranks among the best of Miss
                    Edgeworth’s works. It shows how a youth, whose education had been neglected, and
                    whose temper was naturally impetuous, managed to reach true nobility of
                    character. King Corny, Ormond, Sir Ulick O’Shane, Moriarty Carroll, Dora, and
                    Mademoiselle O’Faley are masterly creations. There is a true Irish ring about
                    the book, although it is composed in the purest English. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helen</hi> is a novel of thrilling interest, and displays greater passion and a
                    finer insight into the more subtle moods of the human mind than any of Miss
                    Edge-worth's previous works. The moral is that falsehood and deceit almost
                    invariably bring misery in their train. Although on a more elaborate scale than
                    her other books, <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi> surpasses them all in grace,
                    charm, aud lightness of touch. Such powerfully conceived characters as Lady
                    Davenant, Helen, Cecilia, Beauclerc, Churchill, and the Clarendons, leave an
                    indelible impression on the memory.</p>
                <p>Miss Edgeworth’s novels are distinguished by good sense, humour, and an easy
                    flowing style. As the construction of a plot is not her strong point, she is
                    generally more successful in tales than in lengthy novels. The vivacity of her
                    dialogues is extraordinary; and in them her characters reveal themselves in the
                    most natural way possible. Her books are character-studies, rather than
                    intensely interesting narratives. Sobriety of judgment is seen throughout; and
                    passion, romance, and poetry rarely, if ever, shed their lustre on her pages.
                    Three of her aims were to paint national manners, to enforce morality, and to
                    teach fashionable society by satirizing the lives of the idle and worldly. She
                    expressly calls some of her stories “Moral Tales”; but they all fall under this
                    category. The two poles of thought in regard to the moral tendency of Miss Edge
                    worth’s works are well represented by Robert Hall, the eminent Baptist preacher,
                    and Monsieur Taine <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0676-0655"/> Miss Edgeworth “does not,” says Hall, “attack
                    religion or inveigh against it, but makes it appear unnecessary by exhibiting
                    perfect virtue without it. No books ever produced so bad an effect on my own
                    mind as hers. I did not expect any irréligion there: I was off my guard; their
                    moral character beguiled me: I read volume after volume with eagerness; and the
                    evil effects of them I experienced for weeks” (Hall’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >IVorks,</hi> vol. i. Bohn’s edition, 1846, appendix, note A). Monsieur Taine,
                    again, says that “this regular presence of a moral intention spoils the novel as
                    well as the novelist. It must be confessed a volume of Thackeray has the cruel
                    misfortune of recalling the novels of Miss Edgeworth” <hi rend="italic">{English
                    Literature,</hi> Criticism on Thackeray). To lιobert Hall’s criticism it is to
                    be objected that a novel is scarcely the place to explain and inculcate the
                    systematic theology of the evangelical school; while we must concede to Taine
                    and the French critics that to burden a novel with a moral, or other special
                    purpose, is artistically a blemish, especially when it is professedly made an
                    aim as in Miss Edgeworth’s case. She remarks very beautifully of Sir Walter
                    Scott, that “his morality is not in purple patches, ostentatiously obtrusive,
                    but woven in through the very texture of the stuff” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Helen,</hi> 1838 edition, 123)—a statement which scarcely holds true of
                    herself. Still, strong national tendencies must be allowed to assert themselves
                    in fiction, ami there can be no doubt that the didactic or moralizing tendency
                    is deeply seated in the English-speaking peoples.</p>
                <p>No writer teaches a more admirable practical philosophy than Miss Edgeworth; and
                    she reaches her object by making her characters natural, and capable, as well as
                    worthy, of imitation. She plainly belongs to the realistic school of fiction;
                    and it is interesting to remember that her Tales are expressly founded on a
                    carefully thought out philosophy of education. She thus gives no countenance to
                    the popular fallacy that teaching is a mere trick or knack, rather than a
                    science resting on well-ascertained mental phenomena. Few novelists display less
                    extravagance than Miss Edgeworth. We feel that her minor characters especially
                    are genuine flesh and blood. Sometimes the hero or heroine of the story is
                    liable to the charge of being the incarnation of a single quality, rather than a
                    man or woman. However, in the case of one who writes with a didactic purpose,
                    this is almost inevitable. Miss Edgeworth has drawn attention to the less
                    brilliant faculties of humanity, and always prefers to be useful, where others
                    would have endeavoured to be striking. In her pages the heroic virtues give
                    place to prudence, industry, kindness, and sweetness of temper. There are few
                    instances of overwhelming emotions or tumultuous passions in her works; and it
                    is remarkable how little the love of nature appears. She never uses material
                    which does not yield some direct moral lesson. All this is the natural
                    consequence of Miss Edge worth’s method and utilitarian aim. But, working under
                    such self-imposed conditions, she has done wonders. Her representations of the
                    humour, pathos, and generous character of the Irish peasantry are an
                    imperishable monument of her genius. Nor is it fair to depreciate the English
                    novels in comparison, <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi> being quite equal to any of
                    her distinctively national tales. The freshness of her stories, her insight into
                    character, lively dialogues, originality of invention, and delightfully clear
                    style render it quite possible to read her works in succession without any sense
                    of weariness. As a painter of national life and manners, and an illustrator of
                    the homelier graces of human character, Miss Edgeworth is surpassed by Sir
                    Walter Scott alone; while as a direct moral teacher she has no peer among
                    novelists. Among the many sweet memories her unsullied pages have bequeathed to
                    the world, not the least precious is her own noble character, which ever
                    responded to all that is best and most enduring in human nature.</p>
