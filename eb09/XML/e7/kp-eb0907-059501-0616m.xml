                    “earl” of England was identical with <hi rend="italic">comte</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">compte</hi> of France; and, so long as Norman-French continued to
                    be spoken in this country, the English “earls” were styled “counts” as well in
                    England as on the Continent. These powerful barons represented and succeeded the
                    Saxon thanes who were <hi rend="italic">ealdormen,</hi> their own title
                    evidently having been derived from the <hi rend="italic">jarl</hi> of
                    Scandinavia.</p>
                <p>The nature of a modern earldom is readily understood, since it is a rank and
                    dignity of nobility which, while it confers no official power or authority, is
                    inalienable, indivisible, and descends in regular succession to all the male
                    heirs of the body of the grantee until, on their failure, it merges in the
                    Crown. Not so was it with either the nature or the descent of the ancient
                    earldoms of England. In early feudal times titles independent of office did not
                    exist. The earls, or <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> of those days, therefore,
                    were actual officers, each having supreme authority in his own earldom, or
                    “county,” under the Crown; each one of them also deriving from his earldom a
                    certain fixed revenue, the possession of which was at once an apanage of his
                    official dignity as earl, and the evidence of his lawful and recognized title to
                    it. But an earldom has long ceased to be endowed with any official associations
                    whatever, and has become merely a title by which its owners in male succession
                    inherit and hold the dignity, third in rank, of a peerage. In like manner, the
                    descent and tenure of the ancient earldoms differed in many highly important
                    particulars from the simple succession of the modern dignity. In the course of
                    their chequered history, we find ancient earldoms, instead of passing by a quiet
                    and clearly defined succession from father to son, constantly depending on the
                    rights of female inheritance; they are seen to have been obtained by many a
                    husband <hi rend="italic">jure</hi><hi rend="italic">uxoris;</hi> they appear to
                    have been transferred in an arbitrary manner, or actually to have been divided
                    between coparceners, or to have been retained for a while by the Crown and let
                    out to farm. At the same time, under such strange conditions as these, and
                    amidst conflicting vicissitudes, until they finally merged in the Crown, the
                    ancient earldoms retained their vitality. They might descend very irregularly,
                    and become vested in successive families, but still they did not become extinct;
                    nor were the claims of legal inheritance wholly forgotten or superseded; and,
                    even if for a time they had been latent or had actually been superseded, they
                    emerged under more favourable circumstances, and under fresh arrangements or
                    modifications they were again recognized by the Crown.</p>
                <p>An earl is “Right Honourable,” and is styled “My Lord.” His eldest son bears his
                    father’s “second title,” and therefore, that second title being in most cases a
                    viscounty, he generally is styled “Viscount;” under all circumstances, however,
                    the eldest son of an earl takes precedence immediately after the viscounts. The
                    younger sons of earls are “Honourable,” but all their daughters are “Ladies.” In
                    formal documents and instruments, the sovereign, when addressing or making
                    mention of any peer of the degree of an earl, usually designates him “trusty and
                    well-beloved cousin,”—a form of appellation first adopted by Henry IV., who
                    either by descent or alliance was actually related to every earl and duke in the
                    realm. The wife of an earl is a countess; she is “Right Honourable,” and is
                    styled “My Lady.”</p>
                <p>The coronet of an earl has, rising from a golden circlet, eight lofty rays of
                    gold, each of which upon its point supports a large pearl; also, between each
                    pair of rays, at their bases, there is a golden conventional leaf, the stalks of
                    all these leaves being connected with the rays and with each other so as to form
                    a continuous wreath. In representations, five of the elevated rays with their
                    pearls and four of the leaves are shown. The cap and lining of the coronet, if
                    worn or represented, are the same as those of the ducal coronet. An earl’s
                    coronet without cap oι lining is represented in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p>In the monumental effigies of noble personages, which yet remain from the Middle
                    Ages, there are many highly interesting representations of the varieties of
                    coronets worn by the earls of those days and by their countesses, before this
                    coronet had assumed its present fixed and definite character. Thus, early in the
                    15th century, effigies of an earl and countess of Arundel, at Arundel, have very
                    rich coronets. The earl’s has a series of leaves and of clusters of three small
                    balls or pearls alternating, all of them being raised to a considerable height
                    above the circlet, the clusters rising rather higher than the leaves. The
                    coronet of the countess differs in having the raised clusters set alternately
                    with single balls or pearls that are less elevated.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In his effigy at Warwick, 1439, the crest of
                    Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, rises from a plain circlet that is
                    surmounted by a series of pearls slightly raised, but without any leaves. Still
                    later in the century, 1483, Isabel Plantagenet, countess of Essex, in her brass
                    at Little Easton in Essex, has a series of leaves, no less than thirteen in
                    number, that rise to a uniform slight elevation above the front of an ample
                    coronet; and about the same time, 1487, the coronets of another earl and
                    countess of Arundel have their circlets heightened with an unintemιpted series
                    of architectural conventional leaves, and once more, at Hever, in Kent, the
                    brass to Sir T. Boleyn, K.G., earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde, represents the
                    maternal grandfather of Queen Elizabeth, with the insignia of the Garter, and
                    wearing a rich coronet, the circlet of which is set with small pearls in
                    contact, not raised, and so numerous that upwards of twenty are
                    displayed.</p></note></p>
                <p>The coronet of a countess now in all respects is the same as that of an earl. The
                    scarlet parliamentary robe of an earl has three doublings of ermine. The duke of
                    Norfolk, who is premier duke, as earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norfolk, is
                    premier earl of England; also he holds his earldom of Arundel, a feudal dignity
