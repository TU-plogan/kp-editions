                    son of Edward II. and of Isabella, was born at Windsor, November 13, 1312. He
                    was appointed guardian of the kingdom October 2G, 132G, and received the crown
                    February 1, 1327. On the 24th January 1328 he was married to Philippa, daughter
                    of the count of Hainault. During his minority the government of the kingdom was
                    intrusted to a body of guardians with Henry of Lancaster at their head, but was

                    1330, and conveyed to the Tower. He was executed at Tyburn on the 29th November.
                    It is said to have been chiefly through Mortimer’s influence that, on the 24th
                    April 1328, a peace was concluded between England and Scotland, the chief
                    provisions of which were that the Scots agreed to pay England the sum of
                    .£20,000, and that Edward agreed definitely to recognize the independence of the
                    Scotch crown. The treaty was very unpopular in England, and it is not
                    surprising, therefore, that, when Edward Baliol in 1332 made his attempt to
                    mount the Scotch throne, Edward III. gave him indirect assistance, and that
                    after Baliol’s dethronement in 1333 an invasion of Scotland was resolved on. On
                    July 19 Edward defeated the Scots at the battle of Halidon Hill, and receiving
                    as the result of his victory the submission of the principal Scotch nobles, he
                    annexed the whole of Scotland south of the Forth to his own crown, and allowed
                    Baliol to reign over the remainder as titular king. Soon after, Baliol was again
                    a fugitive, but was again aided by Edward to mount a nominal throne. After a
                    short period of peace Edward in July 1336 ravaged and burned Scotland as far as
                    Aberdeen, but growing complications with France compelled him in the same year
                    to return to England. Though he professed to have a claim, through his mother,
                    on the French throne against Philip of Valois, that claim was left in abeyance
                    until several acts of aggression on the part of Philip brought about a rupture
                    between the two kings. The count of Flanders, at Philip’s instigation, had
                    broken off commercial relations with England; French privateers were daily
                    committing ravages on English commerce; Aquitaine was continually threatened by
                    desultory attacks; and Philip, though he hesitated to accept the responsibility
                    of being the first to declare war, scarcely attempted to conceal his endeavours
                    to throw that responsibility on Edward. Edward sailed for Flanders July 16,
                    1338, and at Coblentz held a conference with the emperor Louis V., at which the
                    latter appointed him his vicar-general, and gave orders for all the princes of
                    the Low Countries to follow him in war for the space of seven years. In 1339
                    Edward laid siege to Cambrai, but soon afterwards raised the siege and invaded
                    France. Philip advanced to meet him, but declined battle, and Edward concluded
                    his first campaign without achieving anything to compensate him for its cost. In
                    1340 he defeated the French fleet before Sluys, and after landing in France laid
                    siege to Tournai, but before he succeeded in capturing it he was induced through
                    money difficulties to conclude a truce of nine months with France. In 1342 a
                    truce for two years was concluded between England and Scotland, and at the end
                    of the same year Edward again set out on an expedition against France, but at
                    the intercession of the Pope he agreed to a truce. Shortly after his return to
                    England a great tournament was held by him at Windsor in memory of King Arthur.
                    In 1346 he set sail on the expedition which resulted in the great victory of
                    Crécy and the capture of Calais; and in 1348 he again concluded a truce with
                    France. This year and the following are darkly memorable in English annals from
                    the outbreak of the “black death,” which spread terror and desolation throughout
                    the whole country, but on account of the reduction it made in the population,
                    was the ultimate cause of the abolition of serfdom and villanage in England.
                    From this time Edward as a warrior retires somewhat into the background, his
                    place being taken by the prince of Wales (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward the
                        Black Prince),</hi> who in 1356 won the battle of Poitiers, and took King
                    John prisoner. In 1359 Edward again invaded France, and in 1360 he signed the
                    peace of Bretigny, according to which the French agreed to pay for King John a
                    ransom of three million crowns, and Edward renounced his title to the throne of
                    France, but retained his full sovereignty over the whole of the ancient duchy of
                    Aquitaine, the counties of Ponthieu and Guignes, and the town of Calais. Peace
                    was again broken in 1369 by Charles of France, and when he concluded a truce
                    with England in 1375 all of France that remained in Edward’s hands was Bayonne
                    and Bordeaux in the south, and Calais in the north. The last years of Edward’s
                    reign form a sad and gloomy close to a career which had had a vigorous and
                    energetic commencement, and had afterwards been rendered illustrious by great
                    achievements. His empire in France was virtually overthrown; the vast
                    expenditure which had had such a fruitless result was sorely burdening his
                    subjects, and awakening increasing discontent; and he himself, through the
                    gradual decay of his mental faculties, had become a mere tool in the hands of
                    Alice Perrers and of ministers whose only aim was their own aggrandizement. In
                    1367 the “Good Parliament” virtually seized the helm of the state from the hands
                    of the king and his ministers. It compelled Alice Perrers to swear never to
                    return to the king’s presence, suspended the ministers Latimer and Lyons,
                    protested against the means then adopted for raising taxes, and demanded a
                    vigorous prosecution of the war. The Black Prince was the chief agent in urging
                    these reforms, but his death, in the midst of the Parliament’s deliberations,
                    for a time rendered almost abortive the good work he had begun. Edward died 21st
                    June 1377. The splendour of his reign belongs properly rather to the people than
                    to the monarch. Both in his home and foreign relations he showed considerable
                    prudence and sagacity, and he may be allowed the merit of having endeavoured as
                    much as possible to keep on good terms with his subjects; but under him the
                    progress of constitutional reform was due either to his money difficulties or to
                    events entirely beyond his control. Although endowed with high courage and
                    daring, there is no proof that he possessed more than average ability as a
                    general. His expeditions were planned on a scale of great magnificence, but he
                    entered on his campaigns without any definite aim, and his splendid victories
                    were mere isolated achievements, won partly by good fortune, but chiefly by the
                    valour of Welsh and Irish yeomen and the skill of English archers.</p>
