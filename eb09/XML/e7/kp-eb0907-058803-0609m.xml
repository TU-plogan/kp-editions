                    1835 he was ordained to the pastoral charge of the Cambridge Street Secession
                    church in Glasgow. Here he speedily attained a position of great eminence and
                    usefulness, and for many years before the close of his life he was generally
                    regarded * as the leading representative of his denomination in the city which
                    has always been its stronghold. Though he had little claim to be called
                    eloquent, and his style was often slovenly, he had many of the other qualities
                    that secure the most useful and enduring kind of popularity. As a preacher he
                    was distinguished by invariable good sense, frequent flashes of happy
                    illustration, masculine piety, deep spiritual earnestness, breadth of sympathy
                    both intellectual and emotional, and—most specifically of all—by the power he
                    had in his expository discourses of conveying the best results of biblical
                    criticism in an intelligible form to a general audience. Behind the carelessness
                    and apparent indifference of his manner, it was not difficult to detect the
                    quick sensibility and tender feeling which were eminently characteristic of the
                    man. Though more than once invited to an important charge elsewhere, Dr Eadie
                    refused to leave Glasgow, in which he found a sphere more exactly suited to his
                    pastoral gifts than he could expect in any other place. In 1863 he removed with
                    a portion of his congregation to a new and beautiful church at Lansdowne
                    Crescent, where his influence continued unabated until his death.</p>
                <p>From his student days Eadie bore a reputation for extensive, if not profound and
                    accurate, scholarship, which he justified and increased during the earlier years
                    of his ministry to such an extent that in 1843 the church to which he belonged
                    appointed him professor of biblical literature and hermeneutics in its Divinity
                    Hall. He held this appointment along with his ministerial charge till the close
                    of his life, and discharged its duties with an efficiency that was universally
                    acknowledged. While his scholarship was not minute or thorough, he was surpassed
                    by few biblical commentators of his day in range of learning, and by still fewer
                    in the soundness of judgment with which his learning was applied. As a critic he
                    was acute and painstaking; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n610/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0610-0589"/> as an interpreter he was eminently fair-minded.
                    In the professor’s chair, as in the pulpit, his strength lay in the tact with
                    which he selected the soundest results of biblical criticism, whether his own or
                    that of others, and presented them in a clear and connected form, with a
                    constant view to their practical bearing. If this last fact gave a nonacademic
                    aspect to some portions of his lectures, it rendered them not less interesting
                    and probably not less useful to his auditors. Eadie’s merits as a scholar were
                    early acknowledged by the usual honorary university distinctions. He received
                    the degree of LL.D, from Glasgow in 1844, and that of D.D. from St Andrews in
                    1850.</p>
                <p>Busily engaged as he was in two distinct offices, either of which might well of
                    itself have employed all his energies, Eadie nevertheless found time for an
                    amount of work in a third sphere, of which the same thing might be said. His
                    labours as an author would have been more than creditable to one who had no
                    other occupation. Most of his works were connected with biblical criticism and
                    interpretation, some of them being designed for popular use and others being
                    more strictly scientific. To the former class belong the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biblical C</hi><hi rend="italic">yclopoedia,</hi> his edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cruden</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Concordance,</hi> his <hi
                    rend="italic">Early Oriental History,</hi> and his discourses on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Divine Love</hi> and on <hi rend="italic">Paul the
                    Preacher;</hi> to the latter belong his commentaries on the Greek tert of St
                    Paul’s epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and Galatians,
                    published at intervals in four volumes, which take a high rank among exegetical
                    works. His <hi rend="italic">Life of Dr Kitto</hi> obtained a deserved
                    popularity. His last work, the <hi rend="italic">History of the English
                    Bible</hi> (2 vols. 1876), will probably be the most enduring memorial of his
                    ability as an author. Though not unimpeachable in point of arrangement and
                    style, it contains a fuller and more accurate account of the subject than is to
                    be found anywhere else, and almost every page bears marks of the life-long
                    interest and loving research of the author. His almost unrivalled knowledge of
                    the various English versions, as well as his ability as a critic and interpreter
                    of the original, led to his being selected as one of the company for the
                    revision of the authorized version of the New Testament, and in this capacity it
                    is understood that he rendered excellent service. Dr Eadie died at Glasgow on
                    the 3d June 1876.</p>
