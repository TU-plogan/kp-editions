                    their invariable habit of secreting themselves in any cavity, of which they
                    always endeavour to reach the innermost recess (instances being known of the
                    common species hiding itself in the ear of a person sleeping in the open air),
                    and strengthened by the popular exaggerated idea of the strength and attributes
                    of the anal forceps peculiar to these insects.</p>
                <p>Earwigs have been for some time of uncertain position in classification, having
                    been even considered as worthy of the rank of a special separate order (<hi
                    rend="italic">Labidoures,</hi> Duméril; <hi rend="italic">Dermaptera,</hi>
                    corrected to <hi rend="italic">Dermatορtera,</hi> Leach; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euρlexορtera,</hi> corrected to <hi rend="italic">Euplectoptera,</hi>
                    Westwood), but they are now generally recognized as forming a family, <hi
                    rend="italic">Forficulidoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Forficularioe,</hi> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Orthoptera</hi> (the Locusts, Grasshoppers, Crickets,
                    Cockroaches, Mantis, &amp;c.) They have much the facies of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachelytra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidoe</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera</hi> (Beetles), from which order they differ in their
                    pupa being active, resembling the perfect insect except in possessing only
                    rudimentary wings, &amp;c.; also in the method of folding and nenration of the
                    hinder wings, the possession of an anal forceps, and, as in the other <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthoptera,</hi> in the additional external lobe to their
                    maxillae. From all the other <hi rend="italic">Orthoptera,</hi> apart from the
                    anal forceps, they differ in having horizontal elytra covering the wings in
                    repose as in beetles, and in the female not possessing a corneous ovipositor,
                    and from most of them in the hind legs being not formed for jumping.</p>
                <p>Of distinct species 250 are recognized, comprised in 34 genera (of which some are
                    apparently needless); but it is highly probable that this represents a mere
                    outline of the group, as scarcely any naturalists make them an object of study,
                    and their geographical distribution is very extended. There are about 200
                    species in the collection of the British Museum alone, mostly unnamed, and not
                    specially collected. They are found in the whole of Europe, in Syria and Asia
                    Minor, Central Asia, Hindustan, Ceylon, Indo-China, China and Formosa, the Malay
                    Archipelago, the Philippines, North, West, and South Africa to the Cape itself,
                    Egypt, Zanzibar, Mauritius, Kamtchatka, Newfoundland, the North American States
                    from New York to California (but comparatively rare, according to Packard),
                    Mexico, Florida, Central America and the West Indies, South America from
                    Columbia to Chili, New Guinea, North Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand; and
                    species occur in such isolated localities as Madeira, the Canaries, St. Helena,
                    Woodlark Island, the Solomon and Sandwich Isles, and Kerguelen’s Island. As
                    regards pre-historic times, a few fossil species have been found in the
                    territories of Solenhofen, (Eningen, and Italy in the Old World, and of the
                    Kocky Mountains (Colorado) in the New. Seven species have been recorded from
                    Great Britain, of which two are universally common, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forficula auricularia,</hi> the typical earwig, and the smaller <hi
                    rend="italic">Labia minor.</hi> The former of these is found all over Europe, in
                    Armenia, the Caucasus, and other parts of Asia, and in the eastern United
                    States, being also recorded from Japan; and the latter occurs in Europe, Western
                    Asia, and North America. Another species, <hi rend="italic">Labidura
                    riparia,</hi> extends over the entire Old World.</p>
                <p>All are of comparatively small size, and nearly all of obscure colours, mostly
                    various shades of brown or dull yellows and reds: one South American species is
                    white; another, from the Amazon, has blue metallic elytra, which are metallic
                    also in another from Penang; a fourth exotic species is yellow, with black
                    stripe; and several have opaline or iridescent wings. Eccentricity of
                    development is shown chiefly in the forceps, which in a Nicaraguan species are
                    as long as the rest of the body; in another South American form the abdomen is
                    laterally toothed; a third has very long legs, being almost tipuliform; <hi
                    rend="italic">Apaehys</hi> has the body as thin as cardboard.</p>
                <p>Sexual differences are shown in the male by the greater development and armature
                    of the forceps, or the tuberculated abdomen, which is composed of nine distinct
                    segments, whereas only seven are evident in the female. The forceps have been
                    observed to be used in arranging the wings, and are also supposed to be used as
                    weapons of offence and defence, though it is difficult to understand how they
                    could be of any practical assistance for either purpose. The lower wings have
                    long attracted attention from their unexpectedly large size and fan-like
                    structure; in the accompanying figure, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the magnified
                    open wing of the common earwig, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the same of the natural
                    size, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the wing closed, also of natural size.
                    Although possessed of such ample organs of flight, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forficula</hi><hi rend="italic">auricularia</hi> has seldom, if ever, been
                    observed to make use of them, though there is evidence that it does fly; but the
                    other common British species, <hi rend="italic">Labia minor,</hi> is frequently
                    seen on the wing, being often mistaken for a brachelytrous beetle. It may be
                    observed, that the possession of wings is apparently sexual in some cases, and
                    that some species are entirely apterous.</p>
                <p>Some few instances have been recorded of earwigs being carnivorous, devouring the
                    larvae and pupae of wild bees and even their own species; but the majority are
                    in a normal state certainly eaters of vegetable matter, congregating under bark,
                    and destroying flowers, fruit, &lt;fcc., often to a considerable extent. An
                    instance of their adaptability to circumstances is afforded by Mr H. W. Bates’s
                    discovery of a large <hi rend="italic">white</hi> species (above referred to)
                    very common on white sandy beaches of the Brazilian river Parâ, at Caripi, with
                    a white <hi rend="italic">Tetracha</hi> and a white mole cricket; this whiteness
                    was permanent, and must not be confused with the light colour of recently
                    disclosed individuals.</p>
                <p>The female of the common earwig has long been noted for an exhibition of
                    remarkable maternal instinct in defending her progeny, not only brooding over
                    her eggs, but caring for her newly hatched young.</p>
                <p>The chief writers on <hi rend="italic">Forficulidoe</hi> are Dohrn, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Stettiner entomologische Zeitung</hi> for 1862 and following
                    years, and quite recently, S. H. Scudder, in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings
                    of the Boston Natural History Society,</hi> vol. xviii., the latter being the
                    first to discuss these insects in a collective form. (E. C. R.)</p>
