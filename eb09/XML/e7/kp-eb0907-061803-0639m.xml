                    the general Christian church about the end of the 2d century. The origin of the
                    name has been much disputed, some deriving it from Ebion as the founder of the
                    sect, and others from the Hebrew word (∏'2⅛) meaning poor. For the former
                    opinion the authority of Tertullian is quoted, who makes references to the
                    existence of such a person as Ebion; but as counterbalancing these references
                    there has to be considered—1st, that Tertullian being careless and inaccurate,
                    and having no knowledge of Hebrew, may have merely fallen into the error of
                    assuming that the sect took its name from that of a person; 2d, that no mention
                    is made of the existence of such a person either by Irenaeus or by Origen, and
                    that any references to him by Epiphanius and later writers are probably borrowed
                    from Tertullian; and 3d, that the name Ebionites had a very general
                    signification, and represented a natural Judaizing tendency which must have had
                    a more comprehensive beginning than that originating in an individual influence.
                    Those who derive the name from the Hebrew word explain it in two ways— as
                    applicable either to the poverty of the doctrines of the Ebionites, or to the
                    poverty of their circumstances. Undoubtedly the name was applied to them with
                    the former significance by their enemies, but it is more probable that they
                    employed in a bad sense a name already existing, than that they coined it to
                    suit their purpose. That the term was originally applied to the circumstances of
                    the Ebionites seems the only probable supposition; and the argument in support
                    of it may be stated thus :—That the early Christians, both Jewish and heathen,
                    were designated the poor; that the poverty of the Jewish Christians continued
                    longer than that of the heathen Christians, and Origen states that they in
                    particular were named the poor (EjSιωvαcoι <hi rend="italic">γjrηgατlζοvσLV
                    οl</hi> &lt;χ∙7ro <hi rend="italic">Ιουδαίων</hi><hi rend="italic">τov Iηaδυv
                    ως</hi><hi rend="italic">Χρίστον</hi><hi rend="italic">πaρaδeξapev(κ)</hi>; and
                    that, as the Judaizing Christians came gradually to be the only Jewish
                    Christians who required to be distinguished from the heathen Christians, they
                    retained the name. The fathers show a very imperfect knowledge of the origin,
                    history, and doctrines of the Ebionites, but there cannot be any doubt that at
                    first all Judaizing Christians went under that name. In the New Testament there
                    is evidence of the existence of such a party, though it had not then developed
                    into a recognized sect. This apparently did not happen till after the second
                    destruction of Jerusalem and the founding of the heathen colony of Aelia
                    Capitolina, when the emperor Hadrian banished from the neighbourhood all Jews
                    who still retained their national peculiarities. As to the particular opinions
                    of the Ebionites the statements of the fathers are somewhat contradictory, and
                    this for the threefold reason—that by the isolation of the Ebionites from the
                    general church the information obtainable regarding them could only be
                    imperfect; that undeι <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0640-0619"/> the general name Ebionites a good many varieties
                    of opinion are included; and that their opinions varied at different periods of
                    their history. The term Ebionites is used by some writers to include the
                    Nazarenes, who, while recognizing the binding obligation of the Mosaic law on
                    all Jews, did not regard it as binding on heathen Christians (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nazarenes);</hi> but at an early period the stricter Ebionites
                    must have separated themselves from the Nazarenes, who soon became merged in the
                    general church. Of Ebionites proper Origen distinguishes two classes—those who
                    affirm and those who deny the miraculous birth of Jesus: and in this he is
                    followed by Eusebius. The extreme Ebionites, according to Origen, were only
                    distinguishable from common Jews by the acceptance of the moral teaching of
                    Christ; while those Ebionites who admitted the miraculous birth of Christ did
                    not recognize His divinity proper, but believed that with His human nature the
                    spirit of an angel or archangel, or even of Adam, was incorporated. Both classes
                    of Ebionites seem to have had these points in common :—1st, They emphasized the
                    unity of God; 2d, they affirmed the universal obligation of the Mosaic economy;
                    3d, of the books of the New Testament they received as genuine only the gospel
                    of St Matthew; 4th, they denounced St Paul as a separatist; and 5th, they
                    believed that Jerusalem was yet to be the city of God, and some of them at least
                    believed in Christ’s millennial reign. In the time of Eusebius the Ebionites
                    inhabited chiefly the coasts of the Dead Sea, but they dwelt also in Rome and
                    Cyprus. They vanished from history in the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th
                    century.</p>
