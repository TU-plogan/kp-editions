                <p><label type="entry">EGYPT</label> is a country at the north-eastern extremity of
                    Africa, bounded on the N. by the Mediterranean Sea, on the S. by Nubia, on the
                    E. by Palestine, Arabia, and the Red Sea, and on the W. by the Great Desert.</p>
                <p>The name of Egypt in hieroglyphics is Kern, which becomes Kemi in demotic, a form
                    preserved in the Coptic KH1ΛE (Sahidic), KHlli (Bashmuric), and (Mem-</p>
                <p>phitic), with unimportant variants. The sense is “the black (land),” Egypt being
                    so called from the blackness of its cultivable soil.<note anchored="true"

                    that Kern may be connected with the biblical patriarchal name Ham DΠ (forming
                    part of poetic names of Egypt in the Psalms:—“the land of Ham,” cv. 23, 27, cvi.
                    22; “the tents of Ham,” lxxviii. 51), on the ground that it is philologically
                    difficult to connect the Egyptian K with ∏ <hi rend="italic">{Geogr.
                    Inschr.,</hi> i. p. 74, note*). This objection would be valid were the case one
                    of a Semitic word transcribed in ancient Egyptian; it is not so where we have a
                    root which is common, as this may be, to both (c∕. Bunsen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Egypt’s Place,</hi> v. 757, 758). The meaning of the Hebrew root DΠ is “hot,
                    warm.” The Arabic root signifies “it became hot,” and describes blackness as a
                    result Γ Sio-</p><p>of heat; and the word isl⅜i⅛ “black mud” also
                    occurs.</p></note></p>
                <p>In Hebrew Egypt is called Mizraim, D'.iyP, a dual, sometimes used as a
                    singular.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The use of
                    Mizraim as the proper name of an individual appears to be as early as the time
                    of Ramses II. Màzrima occurs as the name of a Hittite, the brother of the king
                    (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> ii. 25, pl. xviii. 77). The
                    Hebrew dual form is similarly transcribed in Mâhanemâ, Mahanaim (ii. 61, pl.
                    xxiv. 22), a word not actually dual, and the Aramaic dual also in Neharina, the
                    Hebrew Naharaim (i. pl. ix. 333).</p></note> It describes the country with
                    reference to its two great natural divisions, Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, or
                    the Delta. In the prophets Mazor, occurs as the singular form, and means Lower
                    Egypt, Pathros being used for Upper Egypt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Pathros may take its name from the Pathyrite Nome, so called
                    from its metropolis, P-hat-har (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi>
                    i. 188, 189, pl. xxvii. 839). As this nonιe contained Thebes, it might have a
                    signification like Thebaïs. De Rougé prefers p-to-res, “the country of the
                    south,” or Upper Egypt. <hi rend="italic">{Six</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    compared to the two Sicilies, though sometimes we find Mizraim for the lower
                    country where we should expect Mazor. (Gesen. <hi rend="italic">Thes. s. v.</hi>
                    Mizraim.) The meaning of Mazor is probably the “fortified,” rather than the
                    “border,” referring to the natural strength of the country.</p>
                <p>The Greek Αίγυπτος first occurs in the FIomeric writings. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> it is the name of the Nile (masculine) as well as of
                    the country (feminine). Afterwards it is not used for the river. No satisfactory

                    conjecturally identified Αίγυπτο? with Ha-ke-ptah, the sacred name of Memphis,
                    from which the westernmost branch of the Nile, the Canobic, with its two mouths,
                    the Canobic and the Bolbitine, those best known to the early Greeks, seem to

                    Semitic origin has been proposed for it. The probable origin is the Sanskrit
                    root gup, “to guard,” whence may have been formed âgupta, “guarded about,” a
                    similar sense to Mazor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The apparent relation of Αίγυπτο s to <hi rend="italic">aιγυπιis,</hi> a
                    vulture, might seem to suggest a mythological origin for the proper name. Μ.
                    Pictet has, however, most ingeniously traced both to gup, to guard, though his
                    supposition that the name originally was connected with the Shepherd rule in
                    Egypt must be regarded as hazardous <hi rend="italic">{Origines

                <p>The Hebrew Mazor is preserved in the Arabic Misr, o pronounced Masr in the vulgar

                <p>It occurs in the Korân as the name of Egypt (xliii. 50), but has been applied to
                    the country and to its chief capitals since the Arab conquest, El-Fustât, now
                    called Masr-el- ’Ateekah, or Old Masr, and El-KAhireh, the Cairo of the

                    « red mud,” the term used meaning both red and reddish brown.</p></note></p>
                <p>By the Greeks and Romans Egypt was usually assigned to Asia, though some gave it
                    to Libya, or Africa. This difference was owing to the adoption of the Nile as
                    the division of the two continents, which would naturally have given half of the
                    country to each continent.</p>
                <p>In ancient times Egypt was the country watered by the Nile north of the First
                    Cataract, the deserts on either side being assigned to Arabia and Libya.<note

                    boundary was at Silsilis, near Gebel-es-Silsileh.</p></note> The Egyptian name,
                    “the black land,” is only applicable to the cultivable laud. The Misr of the
                    Arabs is distinctly restricted to the same territory, the adjoining deserts
                    being called the deserts of Egypt. Physically, ethnographically, and
                    politically, the two tracts are markedly different, but it is now usual to treat
                    them as a single country.</p>

                <p>The political advantages of Egypt, in situation, natural strength, and resources,
                    can hardly be overrated. It lies in the very route of the trade between Europe
                    and Asia, and that between Africa and the other two continents. It is the gate
                    of Africa, and the fort which commands the way from Europe to the East Indies.
                    The natural ports on the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, selected and improved by
                    the wisdom of Alexander and the Ptolemies, whose enterprises have been eclipsed
                    by those of M. de Lesseps in our own days, have always been enough for its
                    commerce, which the great inland water-way of the Nile has greatly aided. The
                    inhabited country, guarded by deserts and intersected in Lower Egypt by branches
                    of the Nile and canals, in Upper Egypt closely hemmed in by the mountains on
                    either side, is difficult to reach and to traverse; at the same time its extreme
                    fertility makes it independent of supplies from other lands, and thus easier to
                    defend. The ancient wealth and power of Egypt should occasion us no wonder, nor
                    even that the country still prospers in spite of centuries of Turkish
                    misrule.</p>
                <p>“The extent of the cultivated land in Egypt [Mr. Lane calculates] to be equal to
                    rather more than one square degree and a half; in other words, 5500 square
                    geographical miles. This is less than half the extent of the land which is
                    comprised within the confines of the desert; for many parts within the limits of
                    the cultivable land are too high to be inundated, and consequently are not
                    cultivated; and other parts, particularly in Lower Egypt, are occupied by lakes,
                    or marshes, or drifted sand. Allowance also must be made for the space which is
                    occupied by towns and villages, the river, canals, &amp;c. Lower Egypt comprises
                    about the same extent of cultivated land as the whole of Upper Egypt.”<note

                    increased. This has been chiefly due to works of irrigation in Lower Egypt, the
                    increased cultivation of cotton, and the greater facility of transport. The
                    increase cannot, however, be very large.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Divisions.—</hi> The ancient like the modern Egyptians followed
                    the natural division of the country into two tracts, the valley of Upper Egypt
                    and the plain of Lower Egypt. The names in hieroglyphics are to-res, the “south
                    land” (compared, with the article prefixed, p-to-res, to Pathros by Μ. de
                    Rougé), and to-mehit, the “north land.” The two were divided by the southern
                    boundaries of the highest nomes of Lower Egypt, the Memphite and Heliopolite,
                    and thus the political boundary was somewhat south of the position where the
                    valley extends into the plain. The most southern nome of Upper Egypt was called
                    that of Nubia, and began at Silsilis. The Greek and Roman division excludes the
                    Memphite Nome from Lower Egypt.</p>
                <p>It is not known at what date Egypt was first divided into the provinces called
                    Nomes. They are noticed in inscriptions of Dynasty IV. (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 93), and their symbol occurs in the name
                    of Hesp-ti, “the two nomes,” fifth king of Dynasty I., Manetho’s
                    Usaphaidos.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. de Rougé
                    has already noticed the possibly commemorative character of two other not much
                    later royal names, *.akau and Bi-n-nuter <hi rend="italic">(Six Prem.
                    Dyn.,2½3,</hi> 244), and this may therefore perhaps have been of the same
                    kind.</p></note> The hieroglyphic name is hesp. In late inscriptions the term
                    (p-)tesh occurs, which is also the demotic form, and the origin of the Coptic
                    (Z√. i. 94, 95). The number of nomes is somewhat different in the various
                    ancient Egyptian lists, all of which, except fragments, are of the Graeco-Roman
                    age. Probably the number varied at different times. Dr Brugsch conjectures the
                    true number to be forty-two, considering the forty-two judges of the dead <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ritual,</hi> ch. 125) as called from the chief towns of the
                    kingdom to a great tribunal <hi rend="italic">{Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 99),
                    which he thinks represents the earthly court described by Diodorus Siculus (i.
                    75.)— <hi rend="italic">{Geogr. Iηschr.,</hi> i. 124.)</p>
                <p>There was a double system of names for the nomes,— the sacred, usual in
                    hieroglyphics, and the vulgar, taken from the capitals, and preserved in Greek
                    in transcriptions or translations. In consequence of this double system the
                    identification of the hieroglyphic names with those of the Greeks and Romans is
                    not always certain. This is the case in Lower Egypt, where the form of the
                    country makes it hard to determine the exact geographical relation intended by
                    any order. On account of this difficulty, and because the hieroglyphic names are
                    of inferior importance in the geography of Egypt, they are not here given. (See
                    Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 93, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>By the Greeks and Romans Egypt w as divided into the Delta or lower country, and
                    the Thebais or upper country. The third division, the so-called Middle Egypt,
                    first occurs in Ptolemy as the Seven Nomes, 'Επτά <hi rend="italic">νοpοl,</hi>
                    or Hepta-</p>
                <p>nomis, Επταvo∕χ⅛. This new division, and the transfer of the Memphite Nome from
                    Lower Egypt to the Heptanomis. are the chief innovations, for the fanciful
                    divisions of Lower Egypt in Ptolemy are no doubt theoretical.</p>
                <p>The following list of the nomes is taken from Parthey’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is very remarkable that the Arsinoïte Nome of the Heptanomis does not appear
                    in the hieroglyphic lists, because Sebek, the crocodile-headed divinity there
                    worshipped was, at least in later times, disliked in most parts of Egypt
                    (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist., 2</hi> ed., 109, 107).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Notitia Dignitatum,</hi> composed under Theodosius IL, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 408-450, gives a new a division of Egypt into four
                    provinces—Aegyptus, Augustamnica, Arcadia, and Thebal’s. Roughly the first
                    comprised all Lower Egypt except the part east of the Delta, which was assigned
                    to the second, and Arcadia appears to have succeeded the Heptanomis (Parthey,
                    <hi rend="italic">Erdkunde,</hi> 518, taf. vii.)</p>
                <p>About the time of Justinian I. this division is found to be further developed,
                    according to the statements of Hierocles. Egypt contained six eparchies :—1.
                    Egypt Proper, Αιγυπτιακή, the west of Lower Egypt to the Sebennytic branch of
                    the Nile; 2. The First Augusta, Aυγoυστα a', the north-eastern part of Lower
                    Egypt to the Syrian border; 3. The Second Augusta, Αύγουσ-τα <hi rend="italic"
                    >β,</hi> the territory southward of the First Augusta; 4. Arcadia, ’Αρκαδία, the
                    earlier Heptanomis; 5. The Nearer Thebais, Θτ/βα’ίς <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eγytστα,</hi> extending to Panos, or Panopolis, and including the
                    Great Oasis; 6. The Upper Thebais, <hi rend="italic">Θηβa⅛</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi> άνω, as far as Pliilae. The division into nomes had evidently been
                    almost effaced at this time <hi rend="italic">(Id.</hi> 520, taf. ix.).</p>
                <p>The Copts preserved the oldest division of the country, and called Lower Egypt,
                    the Northern Region, eJL5.ζ <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> IT (Mem.), Λlgl <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> Γ, &lt;fcc. (Sah.), Upper Egypt, the Southern Region,
                    pHC (Mem.), ΛΛApHC (Sah.) The names of the nomes were also known to them, and
                    are given by Champoilion in <hi rend="italic">H Égypte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sous</hi><hi rend="italic">les Pharaons.</hi></p>
                <p>Like the Copts, the Arabs generally know of but two divisions, the names of which
                    are such as the people of the desert would naturally give to the country watered

                <p>Under the Memlook sultans of the Bâhree dynasty, as we learn from the list
                    appended to De Sacy’s <hi rend="italic">Abd-Allαtif,</hi> referring to <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> 715 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1315-6), the
                    provinces of Egypt were less numerous than the ancient nomes. They are for Lower
                    Egypt—the territory of Cairo and the provinces of Kalyoob, the Sharkeeyeh, the
                    Dakahleeyeh, Ed-Dimyât, the Gharbeeyeh, Menoof, Abyar and Benee-Nasr, the
                    Boheyreh, Fooweh, Nesterawiyeh, Alexandria, and El-Geezeh; and for Upper
                    Egypt—the provinces of Atfeeh, the Feiyoom, Behnesè, Ashmooneyn, Manfaloot,
                    Asyoot, Akhmeem, and Koos. At the time of the French occupation the provinces
                    had been reduced in number to sixteen, and the division of the Middle Provinces
                    introduced, thus reviving the Heptanomis. The Northern Provinces, El-Akaleem
                    el-Bahreeyeh, were the Gharbeeyeh, that of Er-Rasheed, the Boheyreh, that of
                    El-Mansooreh, the Manoo-feeyeh, that of Ed-Dimyât, the Sharkeeyeh, the
                    Kalyoobeeyeh, and that of El-Geezeh. The Middle Provinces, El-Akaleem
                    el-Wustaneeyeh, were that of Atfeeh, the Feiyoom, and those of Benee-Suweyf or
                    Behnesè, and of El-Minyeh or Ashmooneyn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the two provinces of Benee-Suweyf and El-Minyeh, though these towns had

                    mudeer, of which Lower Egypt, including a small portion of the Middle Provinces,
                    contained four, and the rest of Egypt three. At the present time Egypt is
                    divided into fifteen provinces, each governed by a mudeer.</p>

                <p>It will be readily understood that much confusion prevails as to the divisions of
                    the country, more especially at times when an arbitrary administrative division
                    has been used side by side with a popular one, depending upon what nature and
                    artificial aids, such as canals and dikes, have done to map out the country.</p>
                <p>The general appearance of Egypt is remarkably uniform. The Delta is a level plain
                    richly cultivated, and varied alone by the lofty dark-brown mounds of ancient
                    cities, and the villages in groves of palm-trees, standing on mounds often if
                    not always ancient. We sometimes see groves of palm-trees besides those around
                    the villages, but other trees are, except in some parts, rare. In Upper Egypt
                    the valley is in as rich a state of cultivation, but very narrow and bounded by
                    mountains of no great height, which hem it in. They form the edge of the desert
                    on either side of the valley, which has been cut through a rocky table-land by
                    the river. They rarely take the form of peaks. Sometimes they approach the river
                    in bold promontories, and at others are divided by valleys with the beds of
                    torrents which flow only at very long intervals. The bright green of the fields,
                    the reddish-brown or dull green of the great river, and the tender tints of the
                    bare yellow rocks, beneath the deep blue sky, always form a beautiful view. In
                    form the landscape varies little and is not remarkable; in colouι its qualities
                    are always splendid, and under a general uniformity show continual variety.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Egypt, being remarkably equable,
                    is healthy to those who can bear great heat, and who avoid the unwholesome

                    salt-marshes. Upper Egypt is healthier than Lower Egypt. The least healthy time
                    of the year is the latter part of autumn, when the inundated soil is drying. In
                    the desert, at a very short distance from the cultivable land, the climate is
                    uniformly dry and unvaryingly healthy. Egypt, however, is unsuitable as a
                    permanent residence to Europeans who do not greatly modify their mode of
                    life;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Beer, wine, and

                    for invalids Egypt cannot be recommended without caution. Persons suffering from
                    asthma and bronchitis are likely to gain benefit from a Nile-voyage, unless the
                    season is unusually cold. The climate of the desert does not in all cases suit
                    them, the small particles of sand which are inhaled increasing the irritation.
                    The desert air is undoubtedly good for consumption, and a wise plan is to encamp
                    near Cairo, or still better to find some kind of house within the limits of the
                    desert; and there are ancient sepulchral grottoes at Thebes and other sites
                    which afford excellent quarters for any one who will take the pains to build a
                    court and a few rooms in front of them. A Nile-voyage cannot be so safely
                    recommended. The climate on the river itself is more changeable than elsewhere,
                    and often in winter far colder than is good for delicacy of the lungs. No one
                    should visit Egypt in the winter without heavy as well as light clothing.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere is remarkably dry and clear, except on the sea-coast; and even the
                    humidity which is the consequence of the spreading of the inundation is scarcely
                    felt but by its rendering the heat more oppressive. Sometimes a white fog, very
                    dense and cold, rises from the river in the morning, but it is of rare
                    occurrence and short duration. The heat is extreme during a great part of the
                    year, but it is chiefly felt when accompanied by the hot winds of spring and the
                    sultry calm of the season of the inundation. The winter is often comparatively
                    severe in its cold, especially as the domestic architecture is intended to
                    protect rather from heat than cold. “The general height of the thermometer in
                    the depth of winter in Lower Egypt, in the afternoon and in the shade is from
                    50° to 60°; in the hottest season it is from 90° to 100°, and about 10° higher

                <p>On the coast of the Mediterranean rain is frequent, but in other parts of Egypt
                    very unusual. At Cairo there js generally one heavy storm in the winter, and a
                    shower or two besides, the frequency of rain having increased since the growth
                    of Ibrahim Pasha’s plantations between the city and the river. At Thebes a storm
                    occurs but once in about four years, and light rain almost as rarely.</p>
                <p>The wind most frequently blows from the N.W., N., or N.E., but particularly from
                    the first direction. The proportionate prevalence of these winds to those from
                    all the other quarters, in the year, is about 8 to 3; but to those from the S.,
                    S E., and S.W., about 6 to 1. (Clot-Bey, <hi rend="italic">Aperçu</hi><hi

                    winds of Herodotus (ii. 20), which enable boats constantly to ascend the Nile
                    against its strong and rapid current, whereas in descending the river they
                    depend on the force of the stream, the main-yard being lowered. These winds also
                    cool the temperature during the summer months. The southerly winds are often
                    very violent, and in the spring and summer, especially in April and May, hot
                    sand-winds sometimes blow from the south, greatly raising the temperature, and
                    causing especial suffering to Europeans. The famous Simoom, properly called

                    and the Egyptian deserts usually proceeding from the south-east or
                    south-south-east, gradually darkening the air to a deep purple hue, whether or
                    not (according to the nature of the tract over which it blows) accompanied by
                    clouds of dust or sand, and at length entirely concealing the sun; but seldom
                    lasting more than about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.” <hi

                    more violent hot sand-wind, which is more usual in the desert than in the
                    cultivated tracts, but in either occurring only at long intervals. It is a kind
                    of hurricane, most painful to experience, and injurious in its effects. <hi

                    but remarkable phenomenon. It is a very lofty whirlwind of sand resembling a
                    pillar, which moves with great velocity. Mr Lane measured some with a sextant,
                    and found them to be between 500 and 700 feet in height, and one to have an
                    altitude of 750 feet. When crossing the Nile a zôbâ’ah frequently capsizes any
                    boat which may be in its way, and of which the main-sheet is tied by the
                    carelessness of the boatmen instead of being held. <hi rend="italic">{Id., loe.

                    wind from a valley in the mountains is equally dangerous when the sheet is tied,
                    and a third danger is the attempt to move during a southerly gale, when the long
                    shallow Nile-boat is easily caught broadside and capsized.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting phenomena of Egypt is the mirage, which is frequently
                    seen both in the desert and in the waste tracts of uncultivated land near the
                    Mediterranean; and it is often so truthful in its appearance that one finds it
                    difficult to admit the illusion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diseases.—</hi> Notwithstanding the fineness of the climate,
                    the stranger who visits Egypt is struck by the signs which he sees everywhere of
                    the prevalence of many serious diseases, and in the first half of this century
                    he might have witnessed the effects of a great epidemic of the plague or the
                    cholera. Yet he should remember the poverty of the great mass of the inhabitants
                    and the insufficiency of their food (both due to the selfish rapacity of the
                    Government), the insufficient training of the native medical practitioners, the
                    false system of many of the foreigners established in the country, and the
                    reluctance of the natives to take medical advice. Ophthalmia when neglected is
                    frequently followed by blindness, and dysentery in the same circumstances is
                    very often fatal.</p>
                <p>The plague has been the greatest scourge of Egypt. We cannot tell whether the
                    pestilences mentioned by Manetho as having occurred in the reign of one of the
                    most ancient kings were the same as the modern plague; it seems, however, to be
                    alluded to in the Bible as peculiarly Egyptian (Zech. xiv. 18). In 1835 there
                    was an epidemic of plague of extreme severity, during which there died in Cairo
                    a number of the inhabitants equal to the whole adult male population <hi
                    rend="italic">{Modern Egyptians,</hi> Introduction). The last occurrence of the
                    disease was in 1843, when the mortality was comparatively insignificant. The
                    immunity which Egypt has enjoyed for more than thirty years, in which interval
                    there would ordinarily have been several plagues, has been attributed to the
                    sanitary measures of the Egyptian Government, and no doubt these may have
                    somewhat contributed to this result. It should, however, be remembered that the
                    plague is always imported into Egypt, and that there have been no severe
                    epidemics of undoubted plague elsewhere in the period.</p>
                <p>This disease has usually first appeared in the east and south coasts of the
                    Mediterranean, and part of the north coast, a·nd when epidemic seems to pursue a
                    similar cour.-e to the cholera in advancing steadily from place to place. Tn

                    towards the close of the year, one may be sure of a plague of great severity and
                    long continuance. At first the cases are generally few, but they gradually
                    increase, and in the hottest weather attain their maximum. The disease is not
                    long in travelling from Alexandria to Cairo, but it rarely ascends much higher
                    up the river, and has seldom been known at Thebes in modern times. Many medical
                    writers have denied the contagious character of the plague, in particular
                    Clot-Bey, a French physician, who was long chief medical officer of the Egyptian
                    Government, and who published a treatise on the subject (Clot-Bey, <hi
                    rend="italic">De la Peste)</hi><hi rend="italic">',</hi> yet the evidence on the
                    other side is too strong to be rebutted. An epidemic of plague is greatly to be
                    dreaded in the present circumstances of Egypt. Rapid communications would
                    readily bring the disease to Europe, and the interests of commerce would stand
                    in the way of the reasonable precaution of quarantine. It is stated that the
                    plague is endemic in the marshes of Chaldaea. Surely it would be well if the
                    European Governments were to appoint a commission for the investigation of the
                    disease and to ascertain what, if any, is the value of the sanitary measures of
                    the Turkish Government.</p>
                <p>Dysentery is an extremely common malady, and causes very large mortality. It may
                    usually be traced to a careless course of diet, and especially to eating
                    uncooked vegetables, unripe fruit, or other unwholesome food, and to drinking
                    brackish water. Mr Lane has published a mode of treatment which has been
                    attended with extraordinary success <hi rend="italic">{Modern Egyptians,</hi>
                    App. E. of all later editions). Asiatic cholera visited Egypt in its westward
                    course on the first two occasions of its appearance in Europe. According to the
                    Government returns, which were probably below the truth, nearly 200,000 persons
                    perished from the disease in all Egypt during the great cholera of 1848. It is
                    remarkable that after each of these great epidemics the disease appeared a
                    second time, but with far less destructive results. Among the diseases most
                    dreaded by the European residents is liver-complaint. These who abstain from
                    alcoholic drinks, or use them with extreme moderation, escape the complaint
                    altogether, or suffer from it in a comparatively mild form. Hemorrhoids and
                    herniae are among the commonest maladies. Skin diseases have been at all times
                    very prevalent in Egypt. Leprosy is now well known, but not common, unlike
                    elephantiasis, which in more than one form has numerous victims. Small-pox was
                    formerly very severe, but it has been checked in its virulence by vaccination.
                    The so-called guinea-worm occurs, but it is perhaps not indigenous.</p>
                <p>Of the diseases of the eye, ophthalmia is the most formidable, from its
                    prevalence and malignant character; yet perhaps no malady more readily yields to
                    treatment if promptly used. Where the predisposition exists, a slight cause,
                    such as the irritation occasioned by a grain of dust or sand, is enough to
                    produce an inflammation, which, if not checked, inflicts a lasting injury if it
                    does not produce blindness. For this disease Mr Lane has published a very
                    efficacious mode of treatment <hi rend="italic">{Mod. Eg.,</hi> App. E).</p>
                <p>Clot-Bey affirms that pulmonary consumption is extremely rare among the native
                    inhabitants <hi rend="italic">{Aperçu,</hi> ii. 372), yet another physician
                    asserted (but not in print) that he had met with not a few cases in a short
                    practice. Asthma and bronchitis are among the common disorders. The occurrence
                    of <hi rend="italic">coup-de-soleil</hi> is not unusual, but it is rarely
                    attended with fatal results, probably on account of the sobriety of the people.
                    Madness is common, generally in the form of idiocy. Maniacs alone are confined;
                    idiots are regarded with much respect as saints, and it is probable that some
                    persons feign idiocy to become objects of popular veneration, supported by alms.

                    years ago <hi rend="italic">{Englishwoman in Egypt,</hi> i. 166). Its inmates
                    were subsequently transferred to a modern hospital. Nervous affections are
                    uncommon, probably owing to the calm life which the inhabitants lead. Rheumatism
                    is of more usual occurrence; but, according to Clot-Bey, gout is unknown <hi
                    rend="italic">{Aperçu,</hi> ii. 377). It is well worthy of notice that, although
                    ownerless dogs are very common in Cairo and the other towns, and watch-dogs are
                    kept by the villagers, canine madness and hydrophobia are unknown; but Clot-Bey
                    is probably in error when he says that rabies has never been observed in Egypt
                    <hi rend="italic">{id.</hi> ii. 78), for the Coptic prayer-books contain a

                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> In considering the geology of Egypt, its deserts
                    claim our first notice. By a desert is generally understood a wide plain of
                    shifting sand; but this is usually an erroneous description of such a tract, and
                    especially inapplicable to the deserts which border the valley of the Nile.
                    These are raised mountain regions, the surface of which is often covered with
                    sand, debris, and pebbles, intersected by valleys, and diversified, in the case
                    of the western desert, by some oases.</p>
                <p>On both sides of the Nile the mountains are limestone, until a little above
                    Thebes, where the sandstone commences. At the First Cataract red granite and
                    other primitive rocks burst through the sandstone beneath the bed of the Nile,
                    and for a considerable space on the east, obstructing the course of the river by
                    numerous small islands and rocks, and thus forming the rapids. In several
                    places, chiefly on the eastern side, the mountains approach the river, and
                    sometimes reach it. They are always utterly devoid of vegetation, and, except
                    the granite, generally of a yellowish or reddish colour, though in some places
                    they are greyish. Near the Cataract the sandstone mountains are partially
                    covered with bright yellow sand in drifts. The mountains on both sides neaι∙ the
                    river are usually about 300 feet in height, and rarely much loftier. The highest
                    point on the western bank at Thebes is four times that altitude. If one leaves
                    the river and ascends the mountains, he finds a great rocky tract before him,
                    the only easy paths through which are along valleys often very winding. The
                    eastern desert gradually rises until about midway between the Nile and the Red
                    Sea, where primitive rocks burst through the later formation, and the loftiest
                    of them, a granite mountain called Gebel-Ghareb (about lat. 28°), attains the
                    height of about 6000 feet. In this portion of the desert are porphyry, breccia,
                    and basalt rocks, which were anciently much prized for purposes of architecture
                    and sculpture. The western desert is of a lower elevation, and is principally
                    remarkable for its oases, which are deep valleys containing alluvial soil, but
                    they are little productive except in dates. Their beauty and fertility have been
                    naturally much exaggerated. Notwithstanding the inequalities of their surface,
                    it is evident that the deserts rise towards the Red Sea, attaining their
                    greatest height in the peninsula of Sinai, which is but a continuation of the
                    same tract.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable geological change which has been observed to have taken place
                    in Egypt is one still in operation, the depression of the northern shore
                    notwithstanding <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0728-0705"/> the constant deposit of the Nile, and the
                    corresponding elevation of the southern part of the isthmus of Suez. The
                    consequence of this change of level has been the ruin of places on the shore of
                    the Mediterranean, the extension of the salt-marshes, and the drying up of a
                    considerable part of the northernmost portion of the Gulf of Suez. The bed of
                    the Red Sea may be traced for several miles north of Suez, which now stands at
                    the head of the western gulf; and places far north of that town were on the
                    coast in historic times.</p>
                <p>The form of the plain and valley inclosed by the deserts is remarkably regular.
                    In Lower Egypt the cultivable land little exceeds the limits of the ancient
                    Delta, but greatly exceeds those of the space between the two remaining branches
                    of the Nile. The northern coast is protected by shoals and a low range of
                    sand-hills. To the south of these are extensive salt marshes and lakes, or waste
                    tracts, and beyond, the cultivated land. The deserts on either side are of low
                    elevation. To the east of the ancient Delta, a valley, the Wâdee-et-Tumeylât, is
                    in course of being reclaimed by the Sweet-Water Canal.</p>
                <p>The form of the valley, or Upper Egypt, may be best seen on the map; its leading
                    peculiarities may here be noticed. Its course is nearly north and south until
                    just within the border of the Thebais, when it takes a southeasterly direction
                    as far as the town of Girgà, and then turns due east as far as Kinè, from which
                    town it resumes ts former direction. The mountains and desert on the western
                    side throughout Upper Egypt, that is, above Cairo, are generally further from
                    the river than those on the eastern side, which frequently reach to the water’s
                    edge. The difference is most remarkable as far as the town of Farshoot, by the
                    course of the river about 350 miles above Cairo, and about 70 miles below
                    Thebes. Near Farshoot begins a continuous series of canals, which flow parallel
                    to the Nile, and near the Libyan chain, until they terminate in Lower Egypt, not
                    far north of Cairo. Above Farshoot, the eastern mountains recede as far as a
                    little above Thebes, and the western mountains gradually approach the Nile.
                    Halfway between Thebes and the First Cataract, the cultivable soil is equally
                    narrow on each bank. The greatest breadth of the cultivable land, all of which
                    is not now cultivated, on the western bank seldom exceeds about 8 or 10 miles,
                    and on the eastern bank, about 3 miles, but it is usually much narrower.</p>

                    course of the Nile, an opening in the Libyan range leads to a kind of oasis, the
                    Feiyoom, a fertile tract, lying in a hollow of the desert, and having at its
                    further extremity a great lake of brackish water.</p>

                    and the great phenomenon of the country the yearly inundation. With the ancient
                    inhabitants the river had, according to their usage with such names, its two
                    appellations, sacred and common. The sacred name was Hapi, the same as that of
                    one of the four genii of Amenti (Hades) and of the bull Apis. The probable
                    meaning is “the concealed” (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> i.
                    77). The profane name was Atur, or Aur, usually with the epithet aä, the great.
                    The two forms, of which the first appears to be the older, the second the
                    younger, mean “river,” as is equally the case with the demotic and Coptic forms
                    of Aur (ΛZ. p. 78). There are at least three names of the Nile in the
                    Bible,—Yeôr p⅛'., * <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ^,), the same as the Egyptian

                    conclusive as to their identity, were it not that the country between the
                    Pelusiae branch and Rhinô-corura is a waste region, which may have been wholly

                <p>The Greek and Roman name N∈Γλoς, Nilus, is certainly not traceable to either of
                    the Egyptian names of the river, nor does it seem to be philologically connected
                    with the Hebrew ones. It may be, like Shichor, indicative of the colour of the
                    river, for we find in Sanskrit, Nila, “blue,” probably especially “dark blue,”
                    also even black, as Nilapan·ka, “black mud.” The two great confluents of the
                    Nile are now called the Bahr-el-Abyad, or “White River,” and the Bahr-el-Azrak,
                    or “Blue River,” and the latter most nearly resembles the Nile in Egypt. As

                <p>The modern Egyptians commonly call the river El-Bahr, “the sea,” a term also
                    applied to the largest rivers, and the inundation “the Nile,” En-Neel; and the

                <p>The course of the Nile has already been noticedin speaking of the form of the
                    Nile valley. In ancient times the Delta was watered by seven branches; now there
                    are but two, the other ancient branches being canals not always navigable. The
                    ancient branches were, beginning at the west, the Canobic, Bolbitine,
                    Sebennytic, Pathmitic, Mendesian, Tanitic, and Pelusiae, of which the modern
                    Rosetta and Damietta branches represent the Bolbitine and Pathmitic.</p>
                <p>The mean breadth of the river in Upper Egypt may be put at from half a mile to
                    three-quarters, except where large islands increase the distance. In the Delta
                    the branches are generally narrower.</p>
                <p>A remarkable change has been ascertained to have occurred in the level of the
                    Nile above Gebel-es-Silsileh, (near the ancient Silsilis. more than 80 miles
                    south of Thebes), and throughout part of Nubia. Indications of this change were
                    first observed by Professor Lepsius, who discovered hieroglyphic inscriptions on
                    rocks at the Cataract of Semneh, not far above the Second Cataract, showing that
                    the river attained a much higher level in the time of Dynasties XII. and XIII.
                    before <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 2000. He gives the difference of the mean
                    water-level at Semneh as 7 ’ 30 metres, or 23 ’ 94 feet English. He observes
                    that the whole level of Upper Nubia was anciently greater, and similarly that of
                    Lower Nubia between the First and Second Cataracts, but that in this second
                    tract the present level was attained since the time of Thothmes III. of Dynasty
                    XVIII. <hi rend="italic">(Auszug aus einen Schreiben des Hrn. Lepsius an Hrn.

                    which he traced in the Upper Thebais was the breaking of a rocky barrier at
                    Gebel-es-Silsileh, where the low mountains on either side confine the river to a

                <p>The water of the Nile differs considerably in appearance and purity at various
                    seasons of the year. A little after midsummer it becomes very turbid, and not

                    fortnight, owing to the quantity of vegetable matter which it brings down from
                    its upper course. It then resumes its turbid character for the period of the
                    rise, and retains it, though in a less degree, for the remaining portion of the
                    year, until the following midsummer. The water is extremely sweet, particularly
                    in its turbid state. A careful filtration destroys its peculiar flavour, and the
                    best method is to allow it to settle in the porous jars manufactured in the
                    country. It is very wholesome, except during the short period at which it is
                    green. The turbid appearance, greatest during the rise and inundation, is owing
                    to the presence of large quantities of earthy matter, which are annually
                    deposited. This deposit or mud of the Nile has been analyzed by M. Régnault. The
                    specimen was dry, and taken from a canal which conducted the waters of the
                    inundation. He obtained the following results :—</p>

                <p>M. Regnault remarks that the quantities of silica and alumen vary according to
                    the places whence the mud is taken, and that on the banks of the Nile it
                    contains much sand, but when carried by the waters of the inundation to distant
                    tracts it loses a quantity of sand in proportion to the distance, so that, when
                    the distance is very considerable, the argillaceous matter is nearly pure; and
                    thus the soil presents this matter in the different degrees of purity which the
                    arts of pottery and brick-making require <hi rend="italic">{Descr. de l’</hi><hi

                <p>The Nile shows the first signs of rising in Egypt about the time of the summer
                    solstice. At Khartoom, where the White and Blue Niles join, the beginning of the
                    increase is observed early in April (Clot-Bey, <hi rend="italic">Aperçu,</hi> i.
                    p. 3G, 37). The slowness of the rise in the earlier stage causes this
                    difference. Usually the regular increase does not begin in Egypt until some days
                    after the summer solstice, and the inundation begins about two months after that
                    solstice. The river attains its greatest height at, or not long after, the
                    autumnal equinox, and then, falling more slowly than it had risen, sinks to its
                    lowest point at the end of nine months, when it remains stationary for a few
                    days, until it begins again to increase. The inundation continues rather longer
                    than it naturally would do, because the waters are retained for some time upon
                    the lands by closing the mouths of the canals (see the table, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descr.</hi><hi rend="italic">de l'Égypte,</hi> xviii. i. 630, <hi rend="italic"

                    April 10, 1800). The river’s banks being a little higher than the rest of the
                    cultivable soil, the water is conveyed by canals or cuttings, and does not pour
                    over the banks.</p>
                <p>The inundations vary considerably, and, by either failing or rising to too great
                    a height, cause much damage and distress. In the <hi rend="italic"

                    insufficient. This table was taken from the official records of the Nilometer on
                    the island of Er-Rôdah, near Cairo, and comprehends the inundations of <hi

                <p>The Nile rises about 40 feet at the First Cataract, about 36 at Thebes, about 25
                    at Cairo, and about 4 at the Rosetta and Damietta mouths during a good

                    the river has attained to a certain height in feet or cubits, the height at the
                    Nilometer of Er-Rôdah above-mentioned is »leant; and by ancient writers, that of
                    the river at Memphis, which was situate on the western bank, a little higher
                    than Er-Rôdah. If the river do not attain a greater height than 18 or 20 feet,
                    the rise is scanty; if only 2 or 4 feet more, insufficient; if it attain to 24
                    feet, or a greater height, not exceeding 27 feet, the inundation is good; buta
                    higher rise must be characterized as a destructive flood <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Descr. de</hi><hi rend="italic">l'Égypte,</hi> xviii. i. 616). Sometimes the

                <p>Although the water is abundantly charged with alluvium throughout the year, and
                    especially during the inundation, the annual deposit by the river, except under
                    extraordinary circumstances, is very much smaller than might be supposed.
                    Various computations have been made as to the exact deposit left in a century on
                    the land, but they have not usually differed above an inch. If, however, we
                    compare the quantity of deposit on certain very ancient structures, of which we
                    know the date, we shall find that the amount has materially differed in various
                    places. Such differences are the natural results of irregularities in the
                    river’s course, of the strength or weakness of the current at particular places,
                    of the nature of the country, and many other disturbing causes. The mean
                    ordinary rate of the increase of the soil of Egypt has been calculated by Mr
                    Lane as about 4⅜ inches in a century. M. Girard, in the <hi rend="italic">Descr.
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">l'Égypte,</hi> makesit “very nearly” 126 millimètres,
                    or 4 ’ 960 English inches. (For a remarkable instance of rapid deposit, see the
                    <hi rend="italic">Englishwoman in Egypt,</hi> i. 132-134, and plan, p. 126.)</p>
                <p>The cultivable land of Egypt must be regarded as wholly the deposit of the Nile,
                    but it is vain to attempt a calculation of the period at which this process
                    began, since we cannot conclude that the same rate has always obtained, and we
                    must suppose that the causes at first in operation were very different from
                    those which now regulate the phenomenon.</p>
                <p>At the time of the French occupation of Egypt it was found that the cultivable
                    soil occupied only 6921 square miles, or somewhat more thau two-thirds of the
                    whole space included between the deserts; but the quantity actually under
                    cultivation did not exceed 5500 square miles, or six-elevenths of the entire
                    surface. This proportion has since not materially changed. It was not always so,
                    and the deficiency of the population is the principal cause that so large a
                    proportion of the soil which might possibly be brought into a state of culture
                    is left uncultivated.</p>
                <p>Throughout Egypt the cultivable soil does not present any very great difference,
                    being always the deposit of the river; it contains, however, more sand near the
                    river than at a distance from it. Towards the Mediterranean, its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0730-0707"/> quality is injured by the salt with which the air
                    is impregnated, and therefore it is not so favourable to vegetation. This
                    condition, however, is not usually found far south of the sea, or the
                    salt-marshes and lakes, which intervene for the most part between it and the
                    land. In Lower Egypt we find the greater portion of the neglected tracts
                    principally to the east and west of the modern Delta, and in its northern
                    portion. In Upper Egypt the narrowness of the valley, and the more numerous
                    population, preserve the country in a better state of cultivation, and the soil
                    is somewhat richer. The largest uncultivated tracts lie on the western bank,
                    where the valley is broadest, and in places where the great canal running
                    parallel to the Nile has fallen into a state of neglect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Condition of the Country.—</hi> Although some of the accounts
                    of the classics may be deemed exaggerated when they speak of the population and
                    prosperity of Egypt, we cannot accuse them of errors, except in the number of
                    towns and of the inhabitants of the country; for the monuments show us how rich
                    was Egypt under native rulers, and indicate to what causes this condition may
                    reasonably be assigned. From the time at which the Great Pyramid was built to
                    the Persian invasion, a period of between 2000 and 3000 years, the population of
                    Egypt and its extent of cultivated land far exceeded what they are in the
                    present day. The country does not seem to have been over-peopled; and many
                    causes conduced to prevent this, particularly the serious wars in which the
                    Pharaohs engaged. The long and desolating struggles with the Assyrians and
                    Persians inflicted a severe blow on the interests of the country. Under the
                    Macedonians it recovered much of its former prosperity; and when the Romans held
                    Egypt, it was one of their most productive provinces, and a granary of the
                    empire. During the Roman rule various political causes contributed to the
                    decline of the population. After the Muslim conquest this decay continued almost
                    uninterruptedly until the time of the Fatimees; but from that time until the
                    Turkish conquest the rulers of the successive independent dynasties generally
                    governed the country with a regard for its interests, and cannot be accused of
                    the systematic tyranny and misrule of the Turkish pashas. There was a temporary
                    recovery under the independent or semi-independent Memlook rulers before the
                    French invasion; and in spite of much of the Turkish system the country lias
                    again made good progress during the government of the family of Mehemet Ali. To
                    overtaxation, forced labour, and needless wars,—in other words, government in a
                    Turkish sense,—must be attributed the present misery of the peasant population,
                    and the want of hands enough to cultivate the soil.</p>
                <p>Physical causes have had far less to do with the impoverishment of Egypt than
                    political ones. The elevation of the tract north of the Gulf of Suez, with the
                    depression of the north coast of Egypt, has much diminished the cultivable soil
                    in the Delta, by increasing the salt lakes and marshes which occupy its northern
                    portion. There is, however, no greater fallacy than to suppose that the sands of
                    the deserts have done injury by encroaching upon the alluvial tracts, and that
                    once fertile regions are buried beneath them. In some places undoubtedly they
                    have encroached upon the cultivable land, particularly where, as in the case of
                    the canal of the Red Sea, the neglect of the Government had withdrawn the
                    inundation, but no sooner was the Sweet Water Canal opened than fertility
                    returned. On the other hand the deposit of the Nile has been constantly, in
                    almost every part of the country, encroaching upon the deserts and diminishing
                    their extent. It is neglect that has permitted the sand to drift over the soil
                    where there have been no labourers to cultivate it. Above Gebel-es-Silsileh, in
                    Upper Egypt, the change in the level of the river has placed cultivable soil
                    almost wholly beyond the reach of the inundation, and thus made agriculture very
                    laborious, but this is only for the space of about 40 miles in Egypt, where the
                    extent of the cultivable soil must always have been small on account of the
                    narrowness of the valley. The failure of five of the seven branches of the Nile
                    is partly due to the neglect of the Government, as they might all have been
                    retained as constantly running canals; and the decay of the great canal which
                    runs parallel to the Nile throughout the chief part of Upper Egypt is traceable
                    to the same cause.</p>
                <p>Under the government of Mehemet Ali a great engineering work was begun with the
                    view of bettering the condition of Egypt. This was the construction of a barrage
                    across both branches of the Nile at the point of the Delta, in order to regulate
                    the inundation, and thus render the country more fertile and easy of
                    cultivation. After being abandoned this work is now to be completed. Its
                    operation will on the whole be beneficial, although undoubtedly the power to be
                    thus acquired by the khedive, of regulating the inundation for the benefit of
                    his lands without reference to small proprietors, will be productive of much
                    injustice. Egypt can never regain her ancient prosperity without a radical
                    reform. The country has been governed under the Turks upon the system of getting
                    the maximum of revenue from a peasantry allowed the minimum of sustenance. This
                    is what is meant by the high-flown phrases one hears about the welfare of Egypt.
                    The welfare of the population has never been contemplated. The frugal peasantry
                    are kept at starvation-point, and no one prospers but the tax-gatherers of all
                    grades, who constitute the richer class. Yet Egypt is better governed than the
                    other provinces of the Turkish empire which enjoy a purely Turkish
                    administration, for it is held net on the uncertain tenure of an ordinary
                    pashalik, but as a copyhold which it is the interest of the tenant to keep in
                    decent repair.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Under the Pharaohs Egypt was an agricultural
                    country, and both commerce and manufactures were comparatively unimportant. The
                    main energies of the people were expended in turning to the best account a soil
                    of unexcelled richness, annually watered and renewed by the river. This natural
                    policy was the true one for the prosperity of the country. From the sculptures
                    and paintings of the tombs, we form a clear idea of the agriculture of the
                    ancient Egyptians, while the classical writers give us information respecting
                    the tenure of land, and the laws affecting the cultivators.</p>
                <p>In the representations of the tombs which picture the daily life of the great
                    proprietors of land, we learn what especial attention they paid to the processes
                    of agriculture. We see them constantly overseeing the labourers, and thus
                    watching the interests of their lands. They were especially anxious to conduct
                    the water of the Nile over those tracts which were not above its level at
                    different periods of the year, and to raise it by manual labour to the higher
                    portions of the land. In their canal-system they displayed mechanical skill, as
                    well as in the construction of dams and dikes to retain the water upon the
                    lands; but for raising water they seem to have been contented with the rudest
                    contrivances. Indeed we know of but two methods that were employed in raising
                    water,—the use of the simple machine called in the present day the shadoof, and
                    buckets carried by men. The ordinary shâdoof still employed is of the same form
                    as that used by the ancient Egyptians. It consists of a pole resting upon a beam
                    placed across two columns of brick or mud. and having at one extremity a weight,
                    and at the other a rude bowl-shaped bucket suspended by a stick. A man stands
                    beneath it, and pulling down the bucket to the water raises it again, assisted
                    by the weight. (For the ancieut form of the shadoof, see <hi rend="italic">Anc.
                    Eg.,</hi> ii, 4; for the modern, <hi rend="italic">Mod. Eg.,</hi> chap, xiv.)
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0731-0708"/> Immediately after the water of the inundation had
                    subsided, the land was ploughed or broken up by the hoe, and sown, the seed
                    being sometimes trodden in by goats driven over the field for the purpose. Wheat
                    being the most important field-produce, we find the various agricultural
                    processes connected with it frequently represented. Besides the ploughing and
                    sowing, the harvest is depicted, the reapers cutting the wheat just below the
                    ear, the ears being carried in nets or baskets by men or on asses to the
                    thrashing-floor, wdιere they were thrashed by kiπe, Sometimes the wheat was
                    bound in sheaves. The same or similar processes with reference to other kinds of
                    grain are portrayed in the tombs, in which we also find curious representations
                    of the vineyards and gardens. The vineyard was not the least valuable part of an
                    estate. Egypt was famous for its wines in the days of the Greeks and Romans; and
                    it is evident that wine must have been prized in earlier times from several
                    kinds being enumerated in the inscriptions, and from its always being seen at
                    the feasts. Besides the vine, other fruit-trees were cultivated, and especially
                    the date-palm. The gardens were often extensive, and were laid out with great
                    formality, partly in consequence of their being watered in the same manner as
                    the fields generally, and contained tanks for fish as well as for purposes of
                    inundation. The Egyptians paid great attention to preserving fish, and the
                    produce of the fisheries of one great artificial lake, that of Moeris, formed an
                    important branch of the revenue. There were also tracts left to reeds, which, if
                    not planted, were at least carefully maintained, on account of their value for
                    manufactures, and as covers for wild-fowl.</p>
                <p>Diodorus Siculus states that anciently the land was the property of the priests,
                    of the king, and of the military class (i. 73), and the monuments leave little
                    room to doubt that such was generally the case; for though there were no castes,
                    the upper classes consisted of priests and military officers, and the son
                    usually followed his father’s profession. It is stated in the Bible that Joseph
                    purchased the whole of the land of the Egyptians for food during the famine, and
                    gave them seed to sow it, claiming a fifth of the produce as the king’s right.
                    The land of the priests alone was not purchased.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of the modern Egyptians differs little from that of the old
                    inhabitants. In one respect it is the converse: the ancients excelled in the
                    management of dikes and dams, and raised water only by the simplest methods; the
                    moderns, while they have paid less attention to the great canals, and the means
                    by which they were regulated, have employed more ingenious methods of artificial
                    irrigation. The deficiency of population has partly caused the decay of many of
                    the canals and dams and dikes, and has at the same time necessitated the
                    economizing of human labour, for which that of cattle has been in a great
                    measure substituted.</p>
                <p>Of the machines the most common is the shâdoof, already described, but there are
                    also two kinds of water-wheels. The more usual of these is that called the
                    sâkiyeh, which is composed of a horizontal wheel turned by a pair of cows or
                    bulls, or by one, and connected with a vertical wheel which is • ou the same
                    axis as another around which are earthen pots in which the water is raised and
                    poured into a trough. The tiiboot is a similar machine, which differs from the
                    sâkiyeh principally in having a hollow wheel instead of the wheel with pots, in
                    the jaunts or fellies of which the water is conveyed. Sometimes a katweh is
                    employed, which is a bucket like that of the shadoof, having four cords by which
                    two men dip it into the river or canal and raise the water. <hi rend="italic">(
                    Mod. Eg.,</hi> ch. xiv.) Steam-pumps are now largely used.</p>
                <p>“The ’ rei ’ lands (or those which are naturally inundated) are, with some
                    exceptions, cultivated but once during the year. After the waters have retired,
                    about the end of October or beginning of November, they are sown with wheat,
                    barley, lentils, beans, lupins, chick-peas, &amp;c. This is called the ’

                    too high to be subject to the natural inundation), and some parts of the rei, by
                    artificial irrigation are made to produce three crops every year; though not <hi

                    artificially irrigated produce, first, their shitawee crops, being sown at the

                    little later, they are sown with millet (‘durah seyfee ’), or with indigo or

                    or period of the rise of the Nile, commencing about or soon after the summer

                    &amp;c., and thus crowned with a third harvest. Sugar is cultivated throughout a
                    large portion of Upper Egypt; and rice in the low lands near the
                    Mediterranean.”— <hi rend="italic">Mod. Eg., l.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The culture of cotton was introduced by Mehenιet Ali with a view to promote his
                    manufacturing schemes, and the Turkish grandees have found it a source of
                    temporary profit. During the American War the profit was at its height, but
                    subsequently it declined. The necessity of constructing dams to exclude the Nile
                    water from the cottongrowing fields has rendered the inundations destructive,
                    and the speculation seems on the whole to have injured the welfare of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The agricultural implements of the modern Egyptians are rude in construction, and
                    similar to those auciently employed in the country. One of these, however, was
                    not known to the earlier inhabitants. This is the nôrag, a machine “in the form
                    of a chair, which moves upon small iron wheels or thin circular plates,
                    generally eleven, fixed to three thick axle-trees, four to the foremost, the
                    same number to the hindmost, and three to the intermediate axle tree. This
                    machine is drawn in a circle by a pair of cows or bulls over the corn.” It is
                    employed to separate the grain of wheat, barley, &amp;c., and to cut the straw,
                    which is used for fodder. (<hi rend="italic">Mod. Eg., l.c.)</hi> The ancient
                    Egyptians, as before remarked, generally cut the wheat near the ear.</p>
                <p>An Egyptian garden is a miniature Egypt. It is intersected by numerous small
                    channels which are filled by one or more water-wheels. By these channels the
                    water is spread over the garden, divided by them into many square compartments,
                    edged with ridges of earth. This system of course makes it very difficult to
                    keep a garden in good order, and no great variety of flowers is cultivated.</p>
                <p>Though Mehemet Ali was very desirous to encourage manufactures, he did not
                    endeavour enough to apply modern science to the improvement of agriculture.
                    Ibrahim Pasha, who succeeded him, always maintained that the country should be
                    agricultural rather than manufacturing, and introduced important improvements
                    during his father’s government. This system has been steadily pursued by the
                    present ruler.</p>
                <p>Before the time of Mehemet Ali a kind of feudal system prevailed, and much of the
                    land was held by small proprietors under the protection of the great emeers. By
                    the massacre of the Memlooks, the pasha destroyed feudalism, and by arbitrarily
                    seizing almost all the landed property, rendered private tenure of land a most
                    rare condition. He allotted to those whom he thus unjustly dispossessed annual
                    pensions for life, as the only compensation for au act of tyranny to which even
                    the history of Egypt scarcely affords a parallel <hi rend="italic">{Mod.

                    through fear, and buried their title-deeds, which are yet so concealed. A system
                    of government in which the supreme authoιity overlooks such acts, and
                    subordinate governors perpetrate them, in defiance of the Muslim code and Arab

                    Mareotis. This is an extensive salt marsh rather than a lake, except during the
                    inundation, when its contents are augmented by filtration. Anciently this lake
                    was navigable, and thus contributed to the commercial importance of Alexandria.
                    The country around was cultivated, and produced the famous Mareotic wine. The
                    relations of various travellers show that it was still a lake during the 15th
                    and 16th, and even towards the close of the 17th century; and Villamont in 1590
                    mentions that in his time the fisheries produced a considerable sum <hi
                    rend="italic">{Descr.</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Égypte,</hi> xvi. 201). When,
                    however, the French army conquered and occupied Egypt (1798-1801) they found its
                    basin to be “a sandy plain, of which the lower portion retained the rain-water,
                    which remained there for a great part of winter” (7√. 200, 201). On the 4th of
                    April 1801 the English army, which was cooperating with that of the Grand Vizir
                    against the French garrison of Alexandria, cut the dikes of the canal of that
                    city, and admitted the waters of the Lake of Aboo-Keer into the ancient bed of
                    Lake Mareotis, in order to cut off the water supply of the besieged (∕&lt;Z.
                    201, 202). The basin of the lake being partially inhabited, some loss of life
                    and property was the result of this act, which has reasonably been much called
                    in question. The unhealthiness of Alexandria is also traceable to the formation
                    of this marsh. The precedent thus set has been twice imitated, first by the
                    Turks in 1803, and a second time by the English army under General Fraser in
                    1807. At the present day the lake or marsh is unprofitable, and its shores are
                    uncultivated and uninhabited, the whole wearing the most dreary aspect.</p>
                <p>To the north of Lake Mareotis is situate that of Aboo-Keer, Boheyret-Aboo-Keer.
                    It is the northernmost portion of the other lake, from which it is separated by
                    the Mahmoodeeyeh Canal (which here occupies the line of the older Canal of
                    Alexandria), and the embankments or dikes which form its banks. It is very
                    small, nowhere measuring 10 miles across, and extremely shallow, usually not
                    exceeding 3 feet in depth. The water is salt, being chiefly derived from the
                    sea, from which the lake is separated by a narrow strip of land on the western
                    side, and on the eastern by a similar strip of far less breadth, the shore of
                    the memorable Bay of Aboo-Keer.</p>
                <p>To the east of the Lake of Aboo-Keer is that of Atkoo, Boheyret-Atkoo. It spreads
                    when full nearly to the town of Rosetta, and is separated from the sea by a
                    narrow neck of land on which stands the large village of Atkoo. Its extent
                    varies according to the quantity of water which it receives from the inundation

                <p>The great Lake of El-Burullus begins a little to the eastward of the Rosetta
                    Branch, and stretches to somewhat beyond where the canal which was anciently the
                    Sebennytic Branch enters it, and passing through it reaches the sea. Like the
                    other northern lakes, it is separated from the Mediterranean by a narrow strip
                    of land, the coast of Egypt. It is throughout very shallow (ZcZ.</p>
                <p>205) . It is chiefly known for its water-melons, which are yellow within instead
                    of being red or pink, and come into season after those grown on the banks of the
                    Nile.</p>
                <p>The easternmost of the lakes of Egypt is Boheyret-el-Menzeleh, which greatly
                    exceeds the others in size. It extends from very near the Damietta Branch of the
                    Nile to the mouth of the old Tanitic Branch, now called the canal of El-Mo’izz,
                    which passes through the lake to the sea. It also receives the waters of the
                    canals which were once the Mendesian and Pelusiae Branches. The northern shore
                    is separated from the sea by an extremely narrow strip of land. At its
                    south-eastern extremity is a long marshy creek extending into the desert. Its
                    average length is about 40 miles, and its average breadth about 15. The depth is
                    greater than that of the other lakes, and the water is salt, though mixed with
                    fresh. Upon the surface are numerous islands, and the whole lake abounds in
                    reeds of various kinds. It supports a considerable population of rude fishermen,
                    who dwell in villages on the shore and islands, and live upon the fish of the
                    lake. The reeds are cover for water-fowl of various kinds, which the traveller
                    sees in great numbers, and wild boars are found in the marshes to the south. <hi

                <p>The Lake Serbonis, well known in former times as having swallowed up those
                    passing over its marshes concealed by shifting sands, is now dry, and cannot be
                    any longer included in the list of the lakes of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Besides the lakes above mentioned are those called the Bitter Lakes, which should
                    rather be termed marshes, occupying part of the ancient bed of the Red Sea
                    between Suez and Lake Menzeleh, and also the Natron Lakes. The latter, which are
                    very small, are situate in a valley of the western desert, not very far from the
                    river: they will be noticed below.</p>
                <p>In Upper Egypt there is but one lake of importance. It is the Birket-el-Karn, or
                    Lake of El-Karn, at the extremity of the Feiyoom, which is, as already
                    mentioned, an oasis on the western side of the river, to which an opening in the
                    mountains leads. The lake is about 35 miles long, and its widest part a little
                    exceeds 7 miles, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, while in several places it
                    is considerably narrower. About the middle is a single island. The depth is not
                    great, for the same author, who “sounded in several places,” “found what is
                    considered the deepest part to be only 28⅜ feet” <hi rend="italic">{Mod. Egypt
                    and Thebes,</hi> ii. 344-5). Its level is far below that of the Nile, as the
                    bank of the river at Benee-Suweyf, at the entrance of the valley leading to the
                    Feiyoom, is upwards of a hundred feet highor than the water of the lake <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ibid.</hi> 346). The shores are barren or uncultivated; the
                    northern is desert and bounded by sandy mountains; the southern was in ancient
                    times partly cultivated. The water is brackish and unwholesome, though the
                    fishermen, of whom there are a few, drink it.</p>
                <p>The famous Lake Moeris lay between the Feiyoom and the Nile, not far from the
                    river. It was an artificial work executed by Amenemhat III., of Dynasty XII. The
                    irrigation of neighbouring tracts was regulated by it, and its fisheries formed
                    an important part of the revenue. After the subjugation of Egypt by the Romans
                    its dikes were neglected, and by degrees it became ruined. Its position and
                    extent were considered doubtful, until M. Linant’s excellent memoir, published
                    by the Egyptian Society of Cairo, established these points most satisfactorily
                    from the remains of its basin, which are yet traceable <hi rend="italic"

                    that reckless disregard of human life, which is one of the worst traits of

                    note from the eighth edition of this work is here reprinted in substance Writers
                    on the East have not generally been careful to distinguish the Turkish and Arab
                    national character, and the former has thus had the advantage of the virtues of
                    the latter, which has received in return the odium of the other’s vices. The
                    remarkable characteristics of Arab character are high honour, generous
                    hospitality, and humanity, coupled with much deceit in small matters not
                    considered points of honour, carelessness as to religion, though not irréligion,
                    and a love of plunder. The Turkish character is as strongly marked by treachery,
                    often of the blackest kind, little hospitality, particularly to strangers,
                    cruelty and disregard of human life, bigotry as to their religion, which is now
                    giving way to deism, and the same love of plunder which is so common among the
                    Arabs, as well as darker vices unknown to them, which have rendered the Turkish
                    name a bye-word in the East, as well as in the West. The conquests of the Arabs
                    were not marked by desolation; their rule preserved the philosophy of Greece,
                    which was welcome at the court of Baghdad when unknown in Europe. Arab art was
                    due to them, and though long maintained under Turkish rule, at last perished
                    through it. The rule of tile Turks is traced by ruined cities, and whole
                    provinces laid waste; literature has forsaken its most famous seats,
                    Constantinople, Athens, Alexandria, and Antioch; the arts have decayed. Until

                <p>Between the Rosetta and Damietta Branches are several canals, some of which are
                    of importance, particularly the short canal of Manoof connecting the two
                    branches not far from the point of the Delta. To the east of the Damietta Branch
                    are others, of which the most remarkable occupy the beds of the Tanitic and
                    Pelusiae Branches, which have been cleared to a sufficient extent to form
                    canals. The former of these, which lies to the westward of the other, is called
                    the Canal of El-Mo’izz, the first Fâtimee caliph who ruled in Egypt, having been
                    dug by his orders, and the latter bears the name of the Canal of Abu-l-Munegga,
                    a Jew who executed this work, under the caliph El-’Amir, in order to water the
                    province called the Sharkeeyeh. The last mentioned canal is connected with the
                    remains of that which anciently joined the Nile and the Red Sea. Of this
                    important work the greater part was destroyed through neglect, but it has been
                    restored, as the Sweet Water Canal, in order to supply the establishments on the
                    Suez Canal with fresh water. It was of the Pharaonic times, having been begun by
                    Ramses IL, or Sesostris, continued by Neku II. and by Darius Hystaspis, and at

                    the celebrated Saladin, or Salâh-ed-deen, yet it is related that he merely
                    repaired it, and it is not doubted to be of a much earlier period. Most probably
                    it was executed under the Pharaohs. In the present day it is not navigable
                    except during the season of the inundation, and at other times is dry in various
                    places. Its restoration would not be a work of extreme difficulty, and would
                    greatly benefit the commerce and agriculture of the country, perhaps more than
                    any other undertaking of the kind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Products.—</hi> Egypt differs from most other
                    countries in having neither woods nor forests. Besides the palm groves, we
                    rarely see even a grove of trees, except in Lower Egypt. The largest common
                    trees are acacias, sycamore-fig-trees, and mulberry-trees, all of which are
                    frequently planted on each side of the great roads near Cairo; and the most
                    beautiful trees are the date-palm and the banana. The beauty of the palm is,
                    however, in a great measure owing to art, for its lowest branches are annually
                    cut, which causes it to grow high, and renders its head of elegant form. When
                    wild, this tree has a far inferior appearance, being low, and having long ragged
                    branches reaching to the ground; and its dates are small and poor in flavour.
                    The Theban or dδm-palm is a very different tree, having two great branches, each
                    of which divides into two other branches, a subdivision which continues still
                    farther. The weeping-willow, myrtle, elm, and cypress are found in the gardens
                    and plantations, with various trees bearing the fruits to be next mentioned; and
                    the tamarisk is to be seen everywhere.</p>
                <p>The most common of the fruits are dates of various kinds, which are sold
                    half-ripe, ripe, dried, and pressed in their fresh moist state in mats or skins.
                    Many different sorts are enumerated as known in Egypt. The dependencies,
                    however, and not Egypt, produce the finest of these dates. The hotter and drier
                    climates of the Oases and Lower Nubia best suit the date-palm; and the pressed
                    dates of Seewah, the ancient Oasis of Jupiter Ammon, are among the most
                    esteemed. The grape is a common fruit, but wine is not made from it on account
                    of the prohibition of Mohammad. The Feiyoom is celebrated for its grapes, and
                    chiefly supplies the market of Cairo. The most common grape is white, of which
                    there is a small kind far superior to the ordinary sort. The black grapes are
                    large, but comparatively tasteless. The vines arc trailed on trelliswork, and
                    form agreeable avenues in the gardens of Cairo; but little attention is paid to
                    their culture, the common fault of Egyptian agriculture and gardening, due to
                    the generosity of nature and the indolence of the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The best known fruits, besides dates and grapes, are figs, sycamore-figs, and
                    pomegranates, apricots and peaches, oranges and citrons, lemons and limes,
                    bananas, which are believed to be of the fruits of Paradise (being always in
                    season), different kinds of melons (including some of aromatic flavour, and the
                    refreshing water-melon), mulberries, Indian figs or pr ckly pears, the fruit of
                    the lotus, and olives. Many of these are excellent, especially the figs and
                    melons. The trees and plants which produce most of them are chiefly confined to
                    the gardens. The cactus bearing the Indian fig is extremely common, and forms
                    the hedges of gardens and plantations.</p>
                <p>The general plan of an Egyptian garden has been already described. Although
                    seldom in good order, such a garden is often picturesque, having a few
                    date-palms and bananas, and perhaps overlooked by one of those houses of the old
                    style of architecture which are rapidly disappearing. No great variety of
                    flowers is cultivated. Among the more usual are the rose (which has ever been a
                    favourite among the Arabs), the jasmine, narcissus, lily, oleander,
                    chrysanthemum, convolvulus, geranium, dahlia, basil, the hinnè plant <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lawsonia alba,</hi> or Egyptian privet, which is said to be a
                    flower of Paradise), the helianthus, and the violet.</p>
                <p>The vegetables, &lt;fcc., are very common and of various kinds, so that we cannot
                    wonder that the Children of Israel longed for them in the desert. The principal
                    are beans, pease, vetches, lentils (of which a pottage is made, which is the
                    common food of the Nile boatmen), lupins, chick-pease, the loobiyeh <hi

                    and cucumbers (both of several kinds), the tomato, the egg-fruit or badingàn
                    (black and white), caraway, coriander, cumin, aniseed, and red pepper.</p>
                <p>The chief field-produce is wheat (which is more grown than any other kind of
                    corn), barley, several sorts of millet, maize, rice, oats, clover, pease, the
                    sugar-cane, roses, two species of the tobacco-plant, and cotton, now largely
                    cultivated. The sugar-cane is extensively cultivated, and excellent sugar is
                    manufactured from it. There are fields of roses in the Feiyoom, which supply the
                    market with rose-water. The tobacco produced in Egypt is coarse and strong
                    compared with that which is used by the middle and upper classes and imported
                    from Syria and Turkey. That of Syria is considered the best. Of textile plants,
                    the principal are hemp, cotton, and flax; and of plants used for dyeing, bastard
                    saffron, madder, woad, and the indigo plant. The intoxicating hasheesh, which
                    some smoke in a kind of water-pipe formed of a cocoa-nut, two tubes, and a bowl,
                    seldom used for any other narcotic, is not, as has been erroneously supposed,
                    opium, but hemp. The effect is most baneful. The leaves of the hinnè plant are
                    used to impart a bright red colour to the palms of the hands, the soles of the
                    feet, and the nails of both hands and feet, of women and children, the hair of
                    old ladies, and the tails of horses. Indigo is very extensively employed to dye
                    the shirts of the natives of the poorer classes, and is, when very dark, the
                    colour of mourning; therefore, women at funerals, and generally after a death,
                    smear themselves with it. Oil is extracted from the seeds of the cotton plant·,
                    hemp, colewort, the poppy, the castor-oil plant, sesame, and flax. The high
                    coarse grass called halfeh (7 ’ oα <hi rend="italic">cynosurdides)</hi> grows in
                    great quantity in waste place3 and among ancient ruins.</p>
                <p>Many kinds of reeds are found in Egypt, though, if we compare the representations
                    in the ancient tombs with what we see in the present day, it is evident that
                    they were formerly much more common. That they should be wasted away was
                    prophesied by Isaiah (xix. 6, 7). The famous byblus, or papyrus, from which
                    paper was manufactured, appears to be nearly, if not quite extinct, since Sir
                    Gardner Wilkinson had never seen it <hi rend="italic">(Mod. Eg. and Thebes,</hi>
                    i. 441). M. Delile, in his excellent account of the Egyptian flora, merely

                    its flowers by the ancient inhabitants, is still found in Egypt, though it is
                    not common. The French naturalist above mentioned enumerates three species which
                    formerly grew in that country, one with white flowers, another with blue, and a
                    third with rose-coloured, the last of which is now extinct there. On the botany
                    of Egypt, see Boissier, <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Animals.—</hi> The zoology of Egypt is not of remarkable
                    interest, although it contains some very curious points. The absence of jungle
                    and Df forest, and the little cover thus afforded to beasts of prey, as well as
                    other wild animals, partly causes this; and we observe few birds of beautiful
                    plumage for the same reason.</p>
                <p>One of the most characteristic of the beasts is the camel, which is more at home
                    in the dry climate of Egypt than elsewhere out of his native deserts. It has
                    been remarked, however, that the camel, like his master the Arab.</p>
                <p>degenerates when removed into a city or a cultivated tract, that the former
                    commonly becomes mangy, and the latter experiences a physical and moral
                    degradation. The Egyptian camel is of the one-humped kind, which has been
                    erroneously called the dromedary, whereas the dromedary is merely a swift camel
                    standing in the same relation to the ordinary camel that our saddle-horse does
                    to our cart-horse. Camel’s flesh is for the most part eaten only by the peasants
                    and the Arabs of the desert; by the Copts it is considered unlawful food.</p>
                <p>It is very remarkable that no representation of the camel has been found in the
                    sculptures and paintings of the Egyptian monuments, among the very numerous
                    figures of the animals of Egypt both tame and wild, and of those brought from
                    foreign lands as presents. It does not appear to have been introduced into other
                    African countries until after the Christian Era (comp. Desmoulins, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mem.</hi><hi rend="italic">lu à</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Institut,</hi> 28 Juin 1823);
                    but it was known to the Egyptians, although it is by no means certain that it
                    was one of their domestic beasts. Two passages in the Bible which speak of
                    camels in the possession of Pharaohs (Gen. xii. 16; Ex. ix. 3) refer to the time
                    at which foreign tribes had been settled in Egypt; and perhaps the camel was
                    peculiarly the animal of one or all of those tribes, and, as they were hated by
                    the Egyptians, it may have been omitted in the representations of the
                    monuments.</p>
                <p>To modern Egypt the camel is very valuable, since the traffic with Syria, Arabia,
                    Western Africa, and Ethiopia is to a great extent carried on by caravans. But
                    the ancient Egyptians appear to have derived their wealth more from tributary
                    presents than from commerce, to have allowed their land commerce to be much in
                    the hands of foreign merchants, like those who brought Joseph into Egypt, and to
                    have left even their sea commerce partly at least to foreigners.</p>
                <p>The horse is not known to have been used in Egypt before the time of the Empire.
                    Thenceforward the horses of Egypt were famous, and the armies of the Pharaohs
                    were noted for their war-chariots. From Egypt, Solomon, and in his time the
                    kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria, had horses and chariots (J K. x.
                    28, 29). And long after, when first the kingdom of Israel and then that of Judah
                    endeavoured to throw off the yoke of the great kings of the East, and made
                    alliance with Egypt, they put their trust in Pharaoh’s horses (Isa. xxxi. 1). Tn
                    the representations of battles fought by the kings of the Empire we see no
                    Egyptian cavalry, but only chariots, called “horse” in the inscriptions. At
                    later times they may have had cavalry, properly speaking, of their own, and
                    perhaps at all times among the mercenary or auxiliary forces.</p>
                <p>In the present day the horses of Egypt are of a very indifferent breed, and the
                    best that one sees in that country have been brought from Arabia and Syria, but
                    these are seldom of great excellence. It is indeed surprising to find few really
                    good horses in a country bordering on Arabia; and not many years ago this was
                    still more remarkable, though not during the existence of the Memlooks. The
                    finest Arabs, however, are kept in the background by their possessors, partly
                    for fear of the “evil eye,” and partly, in the case of all but the highest
                    dignitaries, to avoid their forcible seizure by those of greater rank and
                    power.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian ass holds a middle place between that of Great Britain and the wild
                    ass, which is more swift of foot than the horse. It is tall and handsome,
                    docile, and having excellent paces, particularly a quick and easy amble. Thus it
                    is well suited to the narrow streets of the t0wn3 of Egypt, and is therefore
                    commonly used for riding by persons of the middle and lower classes. The mules
                    are <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0735-0712"/> handsome, but noted for vice, and for not being
                    surefooted.</p>
                <p>The cattle are short-horned, rather small, and, as of old, very beautiful,
                    speaking artistically. They are exceedingly quiet in disposition, and much
                    valued for agricultural labour by the people, who therefore very rarely
                    slaughter them for meat, and then only for the Franks. Buffaloes of an uncouth
                    appearance and of a dark slaty colour, strikingly contrasting with the neat
                    cattle, abound in Egypt. When voyaging on the Nile, one often sees them standing
                    or lying in the river by herds. They are very docile, and the little children of
                    the villagers often ride them to or from the river. They are sometimes
                    slaughtered, but their flesh is tough and coarse. Sheep (of which the greateι
                    number are black) and goats are abundant in Egypt, and mutton is the ordinary
                    butcher’s meat. Swine are very rarely kept, and then almost wholly for the
                    Franks, the Copts generally abstaining from eating their meat. It appears that
                    the ancient Egyptians, though not forbidden this flesh, rarely ate it, perhaps
                    because it is extremely unwholesome in a hot climate.</p>
                <p>The Muslims consider dogs unclean, and therefore those of Cairo and most of the
                    towns are half-wild and without masters, living upon offal, and upon food thrown
                    to them by humane persons. In the villages, however, and particularly in the
                    Thebais, their case is better, for they are kept as guards to protect live stock
                    from thieves, and from hyenas and other wild animals, which come from the
                    deserts by night in quest of prey. The common dog of Egypt is generally of a
                    sandy colour and strong, though not remarkable for courage; but in Upper Egypt,
                    about Thebes, there is a fierce breed of dogs with wiry hair, generally black,
                    and much esteemed for courage by their masters. Cats are as numerous in Cairo as
                    dogs, and many of them are as homeless. They are, however, liked by the natives,
                    who assign as their reason that Mohammad was fond of cats. This may perhaps be
                    regarded as a relic of the veneratiou in which they were held by the ancient
                    Egyptians. It is not a little curious, that there is at Cairo a royal foundation
                    for the support of destitute cats. The author of this charity was the famous
                    Memlook sultan, Edh-Dhâhir Beybars, whose humane intentions have of late years
                    been sadly neglected by the trustees.</p>
                <p>The wolf, fox, jackal, and hyena chiefly inhabit the deserts and waste places of
                    Egypt, and lurk iu the ancient tombs and deserted quarries. The wild cat is also
                    found in that country, though it is not common. The weasel abounds in Cairo, and
                    is proverbial for its mischievous and revengeful disposition, and rats and mice
                    are not among the least of the plagues. The ichneumon, jerboa, hare <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> and hyrax are likewise natives of Egypt or its deserts,
                    and the tame rabbit is kept for food.</p>
                <p>The beasts of the chase of the Egyptian deserts are antelopes of various kinds,
                    and the wild ass, esteemed by the Arabs and Persians to be the prince of game,
                    which is found in the southern part of the Eastern Desert. The most beautiful of
                    the antelopes is the gazelle, which is often tamed and kept in the large courts
                    of the houses of Cairo. In Lower Egypt, principally in the desolate marshes near
                    the Mediterranean, the wild boar is found and occasionally hunted. It is,
                    however, a timid animal, so that the sport is not, like boar-hunting elsewhere,
                    exciting and dangerous.</p>
                <p>From the representations in the tombs we see that in old times the hippopotamus
                    was one of the wild beasts of the country. It has now retreated above the First
                    Cataract, the southern boundary of Egypt. The crocodile has retreated in the
                    same manner, and instead of being found throughout the Nile in Egypt, is rarely
                    seen even in Lower Nubia. The name of the island of Elephantine, situaie a
                    little to the north of the First Cataract, bearing the same signification in
                    hieroglyphics as in Greek, makes it probable that at some remote period
                    elephants were found in Upper Egypt, though now they are not seen north of
                    Abyssinia.</p>
                <p>In exploring the tombs and dark parts of the temples the traveller is annoyed by
                    crowds of bats, which extinguish his candle, fly into his face, and cling to his
                    clothes, sometimes rendering examination impossible without a lantern. One
                    species is very large, but the common one is small.</p>
                <p>Birds of prey are numerous in Egypt, and of many kinds. Of the most remarkable
                    are three species of large nakednecked vultures—the Arabian, the sociable, and
                    the fulvous; as well as the smaller species called the aquiline vulture. The
                    aquiline vulture has a feathered neck, and when standing is by no means a
                    handsome bird, but it is much to be admired when on the wing from the contrast
                    of the black and white of its plumage, and the steady manner in which it soars
                    in circles. Perhaps the bearded vulture breeds in the most lofty parts of the
                    desolate mountains of the Eastern Desert; for when the French army was in Egypt,
                    one of these birds was killed. It is said to have been of extraordinary size,
                    measuring more than 14 Parisian feet, or more than 15 English, from point to
                    point of its expanded wings. Several species of eagles and falcons, two kinds of
                    hawks, the common buzzard, and the moorharrier live in Egypt, or visit that
                    country, according as they are migratory, erratic, or sedentary. The common kite
                    abounds at Cairo, and is one of the chief scavengers of the city, the others
                    being the crow, the aquiline vulture, the half-wild dog, and the cat. The ruins
                    aud tombs of Egypt, and the modern houses, scarcely ever in perfect repair,
                    shelter owls of various kind3.</p>
                <p>The Spanish sparrow, which differs little from that of Britain, the
                    water-wagtail, linnets, and larks are among the birds of Egypt. The kind of
                    kingfisher which is commonly seen on the Nile, perched on some eminence, and
                    darting suddenly to seize a fish, is very inferior in its plumage, which is
                    speckled, black and white, to the common kingfisher, which is also occasionally
                    seen. The beautiful hoopoe is among the least rare birds, and there are also
                    three species of bee-eaters. The hoopoe may be often seen in Cairo, where it is
                    regarded with some reverence, as the bird of Solomon. Crows of the kind which we
                    call the Royston crow are very numerous at Cairo. Birds of the swallow tribe,
                    the wood pecker, and the cuckoo are also known in Egypt.</p>
                <p>In the metropolis, in the towns and villages, and in the fields, no bird is more
                    common than the pigeon, tame or wild. Pigeon-fancying is a favourite amusement
                    of all classes at Cairo, aud in the villages the pigeon-houses are often loftier
                    than the huts upon which they are raised. Tourists on the Nile inflict great
                    loss on the poor peasantry by recklessly shooting these tame birds. Wild
                    turtle-dovee build in the courts of the houses of the capital. These courts
                    often serve for the purpose of poultry-yards, in which fowls wander about
                    without any care being taken of them, except that food is occasionally thrown to
                    them. They are consequently meagre, and produce very small eggs. Turkeys, ducks,
                    and geese are kept in the same manner.</p>
                <p>Quails migrate to Egypt in great numbers; aud sandgrouse, called by the natives
                    kata, from their cry, are common in the deserts. There also the Arabs, like the
                    ancient Egyptians, hunt the ostrich. A red-legged partridge is likewise found in
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>The islands of the Nile, the sand-banks which appear when the river is low, the
                    lakes and marshes, the sheets <pb break="no"

                    mountains neaι the river, are the favourite resorts of many kinds of wading and
                    of web-footed birds.</p>
                <p>Of the waders the most interesting would be the sacred ibis of Egypt, if that
                    bird be now found there. But it does not appear certain that only one species
                    was anciently held sacred, and if so that this is the ∕6ιs <hi rend="italic"
                    >religiosa</hi> of Cuvier now known in Egypt. The Egyptian plover is famous on
                    account of the story, which modern observation has confirmed, related by
                    Herodotus respecting it and the crocodile. Among the most common waders are the
                    spur-winged plover, the snow-white egret, which has been erroneously called the
                    ibis, and the pelican. The cormorant, too, is often seen, as are wild geese and
                    ducks, both of several kinds.</p>
                <p>Of the many reptiles the crocodile occupies the first place. It is seldom
                    observed in the present day in Upper Egypt. Some years ago it was usual south of
                    Asyoυt to see several crocodiles basking in the sun in the heat of the day on a
                    sand-bank; at the approach of a boat they would quickly plunge into the stream.
                    They rarely attack a human being, but it is unwise to bathe in the river at
                    places where they are reputed to be fierce, and to bathe at any distance from a
                    boat in the part of Upper Egypt where they are found. It is said that the
                    Crocodile’s common mode of attacking a person on shore, who is near the river’s
                    edge, is to approach stealthily and sweep him into the stream by a blow of his
                    tail, the great weapon of all the lizard-tribe. The smaller saurians are found
                    in great numbers: of these a species of chameleon may be mentioned.</p>
                <p>Serpents and snakes are among the most common reptiles, aud are of various kinds,
                    including the deadly cerastes and cobra di capello. The house snakes, however,
                    which are numerous at Cairo, are harmless.</p>
                <p>Fisheβ abound in the Nile and in the Lake Menzeleh. The modern inhabitants of the
                    couutry are partial to fish as food, but they say that only those fishes which
                    have scales are wholesome. The fishes of the Nile are generally insipid in
                    comparison to those of the sea; though a few of them, particularly the bultee
                    <hi rend="italic">(Labrus niloticus,</hi> Linn.), the kishr <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Perea nilotica),</hi> and the binnee <hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bynni,</hi> Arted.), are of a delicate flavour.</p>
                <p>One of the commonest insects is the dangerous scorpion. Its sting is very
                    painful, and, if no remedy is applied, sometimes fatal, particularly if a person
                    is stung in the heel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    little ipecacuanha, made into a paste with water and applied externally to the

                    it used, almost instant relief.</p></note> Large spiders are abundant, including
                    more than one species of <hi rend="italic">solpuga,</hi> incorrectly called
                    tarantulas by the Europeans, and believed by the natives to be very venomous,
                    but this is most likely an error Egypt has ever been famous for what may be
                    termed insect-plagues, but not to the extent that has been asserted by some
                    modern travellers. Caution will enable one partially to escape the attacks of
                    fleas and bugs, and altogether to avoid the more dreaded insect usually spoken
                    of with them. Beetles of various kinds are found, including that which was
                    anciently held sacred, the scarabaeus. Locusts are seldom seen, and very rarely
                    in large numbers. When, however, such is the case, they commit great havoc in
                    the fields and gardens, reminding one of the account of the plague of locusts
                    which preceded the Exodus, and the remarkable passage in the book of Joel (ii.
                    1-11) describing an invading army as a destructive flight of locusts. Sometimes
                    they merely cross the valley of Upper Egypt, and leave the mark of their passage
                    in desolated fields, entirely stripped of verdure; and at other times they
                    spread themselves for days, or even weeks, over the cultivated lands, committing
                    far more extensive mischief.</p>
                <p>Bees are kept in Egypt, and their honey is much prized by the inhabitants, who
                    usually eat it in a clarified state. It is inferior to that of England, and also
                    to the famou.- Greek honey. Butterflies and moths of many kinds are observed in
                    the fields. There are plantations of mulberry· trees in the eastern part of
                    Lower Egypt, for the rearing of silk-worms. The manufacture of silks was a
                    Government monopoly, but has lately ceased to be so. The silks of Egypt are
                    generally inferior to those of Syria and other Eastern countries, though some
                    have been produced of great excellence. Among the other insects may be mentioned
                    the common fly, rightly deserving a place among the plagues of Egypt, as doeε
                    also the mosquito, which, however, is not found throughout the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Inhabitants.—</hi> In the following remarks on the
                    ancient Egyptians great assistance has been derived from the valuable work of
                    Sir Gardner Wilkinson on their Manners and Customs, which has made us better
                    acquainted with them than we are with any other people of antiquity. From the
                    representations of their monuments, and from the mummies which have been
                    unrolled, we can form an accurate idea of the personal characteristics of the
                    ancient Egyptians. In consequence of a misconception of a passage in Herodotus
                    (ii. 104), and confused notions respecting the inhabitants of Africa, it has
                    been often supposed that the Egyptians were very nearly allied to the negro
                    race. A careful examination of the most distinct data in our possession has,
                    however, produced a far different result; and it is now acknowledged that they
                    were more related to the Caucasian than to the negro type. It has also been
                    shown that most of the modern inhabitants have preserved many of the
                    characteristics of their ancient predecessors, and that it is, therefore,
                    erroneous to suppose that they are chiefly of Arab origin, although the
                    intermixture of Arab blood has so much changed the national type that it would
                    not be safe to describe the earlier people from the appearance of the present.
                    Nevertheless, one is often struck, among the remains of ancient monuments, by
                    the similarity of an early representation to some one of the natives standing
                    by, priding himself upon an Arab origin, and repudiating the reproach that he is
                    of the race of Pharaoh.</p>
                <p>Judging from the monuments and mummies, the countenance of the ancient Egyptians
                    was oval, and narrower in the case of the men than of the women. The forehead
                    was small and somewhat retiring, but well-shaped; the eyes large, long, and
                    generally black; the nose rather •long, and with a slight bridge; the mouth
                    expressive, with rather full lips, and white and regular teeth; the chin small
                    and round, and the cheek-bones a little prominent. The hair was long, full,
                    crisp, somewhat harsh, and almost always black. The beard was worn in so
                    artificial a mode that one cannot judge whether it was full or not. The skin of
                    the men was dark brown; that of the women varied from olive to pink flesh-colour
                    in different persons. The colour of the women was natural, and the darker hue of
                    the men the result of exposure to the sun, and the scantiness of their clothing
                    explains why their faces were not darker thau the rest of their bodies.</p>
                <p>The dress of the ancient Egyptians did not much vary at different periods. Under
                    Dynasty IV. it was, however, simpler thau under the Empire. As most monuments
                    remain of the Empire, the dress of the inhabitants at that time will be
                    described, and this description will apply, in its main particulars, to the
                    earlier and later times of their aucient history.</p>
                <p>The men of all classes either had shaven heads, with skull-caps, or wore their
                    own hair, or wigs, very full, and in numerous plaits or curls, falling to the
                    shoulders, but sometimes much shorter and in the form of a bag; there <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n737/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0737-0714"/> is, indeed, reason to suppose that the practice
                    of shaving the -head was universal, except among the soldiers. All the hair of
                    the face was also shaven, except in the cases of kings and great persons, who
                    bad a small formal beard, possibly artificial, beneath the chin.</p>
                <p>The king was distinguished from his subjects by the richness of his apparel. His
                    head-dress was sometimes his own hair, or the wig, alone; and at others he wore
                    the high crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, the former being a kind of conical
                    helmet, and the latter a short cap with a tall point behind, worn outside the
                    other. He is also occasionally represented with another form of high cap. The
                    figure of an asp, the emblem of royalty, is often tied just above his forehead.
                    His beard was about three inches long, and one inch broad and deep, and formally
                    plaited.</p>
                <p>The simplest royal dress was a kilt, usually reaching nearly to the knees, rather
                    full in front, having a girdle above, from which hung before a broad band,
                    richly ornamented, and peculiar to the king, like the lion’s tail (natural or
                    artificial) which was attached to it behind, and reached nearly to the ground.
                    Sometimes a large and full shirt was worn over the kilt, descending almost to
                    the ankles, and having wide sleeves reaching to the elbow: this outer dress is
                    occasionally simply a skirt. Both these dresses were usually of white linen, and
                    the outer dress was apparently very fine and transparent. Sandals were worn on
                    the feet, and the ornaments were armlets, bracelets, both flat and broad, and
                    deep necklaces.</p>
                <p>The ordinary costume of men of the upper and middle classes was the same as that
                    of the king, the short kilt, with sometimes the long shirt or skirt of fine
                    linen above it, tied in various forms. Their beards were very short, scarcely
                    exceeding an inch in length, and of a formal square shape, and they wore the
                    full hair or wig, or a skull-cap. They generally went barefoot, but sometimes
                    used sandals. The priest was occasionally clad in a leopard’s skin, either tied
                    or thrown over the shoulder, or worn as a shirt, the fore-leg3 forming sleeves.
                    Military personages are often represented with helmets, and sometimes with short
                    coats or corslets of plate-mail. The royal princes were distinguished by a side
                    lock apparently curiously plaited.</p>
                <p>The men of the lower class wore the kilt and girdle alone, or, especially when
                    engaged in laborious work, went altogether naked. They shaved the head and face,
                    and had no head-covering but the skull-cap. The soldiers had kilts of different
                    kinds, and coats or corslets of plate-mail, and either wore full hair or
                    helmets.</p>
                <p>The dress of the queen consisted of a tight skirt, descending to the ankles,
                    supported by shoulder-straps, and bound at the waist by a girdle, with long ends
                    falling in front. Over this was usually worn a full shirt of fine linen, with
                    wide sleeves reaching below the elbows, and having a broad skirt falling to the
                    ground. It much resembles the upper dress of the king, or of men of the richer
                    classes. The queen was distinguished by her head-dress, which was in the form of
                    a vulture with outspread wings, the bird’s head projecting over the forehead,
                    and the wings falling on either side, while the tail extended behind. Sometimes
                    the queen is also known by the royal asp above her forehead, and at other times
                    she is represented with various forms of head-dress. The queen also wore
                    sandals. (For illustrations of royal dress see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Costume,</hi> vol. vi., p. 457-8.)</p>
                <p>The dress of ladies was the same as that of the queen, without the distinguishing
                    ornaments, but they frequently appeared in the under garment or skirt alone. The
                    women of the lower class wore that garment only, and sometimes it was much
                    shorter than that of the ladies, particularly when they were engaged in manual
                    labour. The women’s hair was worn in the same manner as the men’s, but it was of
                    greater length, usually reaching about halfway from the shoulders to the waist,
                    being rarely longer, and sometimes much shorter. It was ornamented in various
                    ways, but the general form was always the same.</p>
                <p>The children of all ranks were very simply dressed, when clad at all, though
                    those of rich persons were sometimes attired as their elders. Boys were
                    distinguished by the side-lock, which the princes, as before mentioned, wore in
                    a peculiar fashion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> The credit which the Egyptian priests enjoyed
                    in antiquity for a knowledge of philosophy led to the expectation among modern
                    scholars that, when hieroglyphics were read, the world would recover a lost body
                    of human speculation. The first results disappointed this expectation, but later
                    studies have gone far to justify it. The statement of what those studies have
                    achieved may be divided into the two main subjects—the teaching as to the gods
                    and that as to man’s duties and destinies, rites and ceremonies coming under
                    both heads.</p>
                <p>Had the Egyptians any idea of one God ?—in other words, is their religion a
                    complex structure raised upon a recognized monotheistic foundation 1 The
                    Egyptian religious writings are held by M. de Ilougé to give an affirmative
                    answer to this question. They speak of one supreme being, self-existent,
                    self-producing, the creator of heaven and earth, called the double god or double
                    being, as the parent of a second manifestation. From the idea of a supreme
                    deity, at once father and mother, producing a second form, probably originated a
                    first triad like the triads of father, mother, and son frequent in Egyptian
                    mythology. To the local divinities the attributes of th s supreme deity are
                    given, as though they were mere personifications: that they were originally so
                    is, however, not certain. Ra, the sun, is indeed spoken of as this supreme
                    being, but this appears to have been a later phase of opinion. (De Rougé,
                    “Etudes sur le Rituel Funéraire,” 7ι⅛u <hi rend="italic">Arch.,</hi> n.s., i.
                    356 <hi rend="italic">seqq.}</hi> It was probably an attempt to substitute a
                    popular materialistic belief for a philosophical creed. A significant instance
                    of this tendency is perhaps seen in the endeavour of a king of Dynasty XVIII. to
                    abolish all worship but that of the solar disk—sun-worship in its most material
                    form.</p>
                <p>A very ancient moral tract, the papyrus of Ptah hotep, composed under Dynasty V.,
                    although a purely Egyptian work, mentioning Osiris and a divinity who may be a
                    form of Osiris, yet speaks constantly of God as if the author had the idea of
                    one God.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“L’idée
                    abstraite de la Divinité intervient fréquemment dans 1⅛ texte, comme si l'auteur
                    avait la notion de l’unité et de l'indivisibilité divine. Mais cette manière de
                    parler n’appartient pas exclusivement à cet antique document. On la rencontre
                    fréquemment dans les textes plus modernes et notamment an Rituel. D’ailleurs le
                    nom d’Osiris et celui de Dieu double crocodile suffisent pour nous démontrer que
                    nous avons affaire λ un monument de pure origine égyptienne.” Chabas, “Le plus
                    ancien livre du monde,” <hi rend="italic">Rev. Arch.</hi> xv. IG.</p></note></p>
                <p>It also appears from one remarkable fact that this idea prevailed in Egypt before
                    the conversion of the nation to Christianity. The Copts took care to eliminate
                    from their vocabulary all the words connected with the religion of their
                    forefathers, substituting for them Greek equivalents. Their term for God is,
                    however, not Greek but Egyptian, ΠOY <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> f"&gt; ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> hieroglyphic neter. They also used it for heathen
                    objects of worship, god or goddess. These uses must therefore have been
                    prevalent in the vulgar dialect when it was first written in Coptic.</p>
                <p>Though it cannot reasonably be doubted that the Egyptians had a distinct idea of
                    monotheism, this idea was mixed up with the basest polytheism. The double
                    character which we perceive in the race and the language, both partly Nigritian,
                    partly Semitic, is equally evident in the religion. Every town in Egypt had its
                    sacred <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0738-0715"/> animal, or fetish, and every town its local
                    divinities. Λs the animal worship was associated with higher ideas by the union
                    of an animal’s head with the body of a man in the figures of divinities, so the
                    local divinities were connected with the monotheistic idea by intermediate
                    forms, principally identifying them with Ra, who thus was the generally received
                    form of the notion of one god. According to this view monotheism was not the
                    parent of polytheism, but in a later phase connected with it.</p>
                <p>One great change affected the essential ideas of the Egyptian religion. For many
                    centuries Seth, specially the divinity of Lower Egypt, who seems to have
                    represented then, as certainly afterwards, the destructive power of nature, held
                    a place in the Pantheon, although regarded as the adversary of Osiris and thus
                    of mankind, whom, however, he finally befriends. He seems thus to have a
                    character of necessary evil. At length, after the Empire, he was expelled from
                    the Pantheon. This may have been because the worship of Seth was repugnant to a
                    reigning house of Asiatic origin, which might have held the Persian dualism
                    which identified physical and moral evil. It may have been because Seth had been
                    considered to be the divinity of the eastern neighbours of Egypt, and with their
                    success and the fall of Egyptian supremacy had come to be thought hostile to
                    that country. If this were the cause, the kings who proscribed his worship could
                    have had no relation to the nations supposed to reverence Seth. In effect the
                    change identified physical and moral evil and destroyed the earlier
                    philosophical notions on the subject, besides introducing some confusion into
                    the Pantheon.</p>
                <p>Herodotus speaks of orders of gods, Manetho of divine dynasties. The explanation
                    is to be found in the worship at each town of a cycle of gods. This cycle is
                    called “the society of the gods,” or “the nine gods.” M. de Rougé does not admit
                    the second rendering except as a plural of excellence (“Etudes,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Rev. Arch.,</hi> n.s., i. 237). The number varies at different
                    places and in different lists at the same place, but is always nearly or exactly
                    nine. The Egyptians themselves explained this cycle as the selfdevelopment of
                    Ra; the other gods were in this view his attributes (De Rougé, <hi rend="italic"
                    >l.c.</hi> 236, 237; <hi rend="italic">Rit.</hi> xvii. 2, 3). Two forms of the
                    cycle acquired the highest importance as representing the systems of the learned
                    men of Memphis and Thebes, the successive great capitals of Egypt.<note

                <p>The views of Professor Lepsius on the origin and constitution of these systems,
                    with such modifications as later researches have suggested, may now be given. We
                    first observe that the two systems are but variations, and may be treated as
                    one. They consist of male divinities, most of whom are associated with
                    goddesses. These goddesses hold an inferior place, and are not to be counted in
                    reckoning the number of the order, except perhaps Isis, whose importance is much
                    greater than that of the others. An examination of the various forms of the two
                    systems immediately suggests that they increased in course of time, Ptah and
                    Amen, the chief gods of Memphis and Thebes, having been added for state reasons.
                    The order thus reduced consists of two groups, the group of Ra, and that of
                    Osiris. The group of Ra is wholly of solar gods, the group of Osiris begine with
                    Seb and ends with Hathor. Sebek then stands alone, but he is w anting in the
                    older lists, and is only an addition of the Theban system.</p>
                <p>The solar group consists of Ra, or else Mentu and Atmu, and Shu. Mentu and Atmu
                    are merely a division of Ra into his two chief phases, the rising and the
                    setting sun, the sun of the upper and of the lower world. Both are solar
                    divinities (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geoyr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 254.) Shu, the
                    solar light, is the son of Ra or of Mentu or Atmu; Tefnet, the goddess
                    associated with him, is the daughter of Ra.</p>
                <p>The Osiris group is not genealogically connected with the solar group. The
                    central point of the group is found in Osiris, with his consort Isis and his
                    opponent Seth. Seb and Nut are merely extensions of the group upwards. They are,
                    however, spoken of as parents of the gods, showing that they represent the
                    commencement of a series. Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Nephthys were usually
                    considered their children, and Horus, the child of Osiris and Isis. Hathor
                    is'associated with Horus, but her genealogical place is not clear. It is,
                    however, certain that she is of the family of Osiris. The characteristics of
                    this group are predominantly cosmic; this is true of the myth of Osiris, and
                    consequently of the whole group, and is especially evident in the cases of
                    Osiris and Isis, Seth, and Seb and Nut.</p>
                <p>How did these two groups come to be united in a single series 1 Professor Lepsius
                    argues that this was due to the influence of Thinis, the oldest Egyptian royal
                    seat, from which the first historic king Menes came to Lower Egypt and founded
                    Memphis. Thinis at a very early time merged into the more famous Abydos. Abydos
                    was the great seat of the worship of Osiris, which spread all over Egypt,
                    establishing itself in a remarkable manner at Memphis. All the mysteries of the
                    Egyptians and their whole doctrine of the future state attach themselves to this
                    worship. Osiris was identified with the sun, and the union of the two groups was
                    thus not forced. Both had indeed a common origin. Sun-worship was the primitive
                    form of the Egyptian religion, perhaps even pre-Egyptian. The first development
                    was the myth of Osiris, due to the importance of Thinis, just as the rise of
                    Memphis put Ptah, an abstract idea of intellectual power, even before Ra. So the
                    rise of Thebes introduced Amen, who was identified in the form Amen-ra with Ra,
                    and as. an intellectual principle placed before the physical solar powers. This
                    argument derives great weight from the relative position given to the two
                    groups, the solar divinities coming first, and from the circumstance that the
                    religious reform under Dynasty XVIII. suppressed everything but material
                    sunworship, as though this had been the primitive belief of Egypt.<note

                <p>Ba, the sun, is usually represented as a hawk-headed man, occasionally as a man,
                    in both cases generally bearing on his head the solar disk, round which the
                    uraeus, symbolic of royal power, is sometimes coiled. His symbol is either the
                    solar disk or the hawk. Ra had the most general worship of any Egyptian
                    divinity, except Osiris. The worship of Osiris under his own name was more
                    common than that of Ra under his, but this was in some degree compensated for by
                    the union of Ra with other gods besides solar ones, such as Amen, Num, Sebek,
                    forming the compound divinities Amen-ra, Num-ra, Sebek-ra (Lepsius, <hi

                    sovereignty, so that each king was a Ra son of Ra. This importance of his
                    worship was due to the adoption of Ra as the leading representative of the
                    supreme being, from whom indeed he is sometimes undistinguishable in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ritual,</hi> though <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> as already
                    noticed this docs not seem to have been the primitive opinion, for there are
                    evidences of his inferiority to the supreme god and to Osiris (De Rouge,
                    “Etudes,” <hi rend="italic">Rev. Arch.,</hi>. ’ ι. s., i. 358). In the religious
                    paintings lie is the supreme being, carrying on in his course a constant warfare
                    with and triumph over evil, represented by the great serpent Apap, a tvholly
                    evil being, not a divinity. His careeι resembles that of Osiris, but with
                    notable differences. Ra is purely solar. He is rarely associated with any
                    consort, and if so associated his consort is a female Ra (Lepsius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Erst. Acg.</hi><hi rend="italic">Götter· kreis).</hi> He is always
                    victorious. He protects mankind, but has nothing in common with them. Osiris on
                    the other hand is only solar because he is the beneficent power of nature. He is
                    constantly associated with Isis. He has a life-long conflict with a maleficent
                    power, his brother or son Seth, who is not wholly evil. Vanquished and killed he
                    recovers his life and wins, but it is rather Horus his son who wins, and Horus,
                    a sun-god, is the direct link with Ra in the Osiris family. Osiris protects
                    mankind because his life resembled theirs: if he did not live on earth, at least
                    his tomb was shown there. At Heliopolis two animals sacred to Ra were
                    reverenced, the black bull Mnevis, sacred to Ra and Atmu, and the Phoenix
                    (Bennu) sacred to Ra. Both are connected with Osiris, the bull by the worship of
                    Apis at Heliopolis, the Plioenix as also representing Osiris (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geogr. lηschr.,</hi> i. 257, 258). In addition the sacred
                    Persea-tree was reverenced at Heliopolis.</p>
                <p>In the attempt under Dynasty XVIII. to establish sun-worship in an original or
                    ideal simplicity, the only representation is the solar disk with the uraeus
                    entwined round it, and rays ending in human hands, one of which offers the
                    symbol of life to the worshipper. The great sun-temple then founded contained no
                    statue whatever (Lepsius, <hi rend="italic">Erst. Aeg. OiiUerkrcis).</hi></p>
                <p>Mentu and Atmu may best be noticed together as merely two phases of Ra,
                    representing, as already stated, the rising and the setting sun, the sun of the
                    upper and the lower world. Their twincharacter is seen in the circumstance that
                    Mentu was worshipped at Southern An (Hermonthis) and Atmu at Northern An
                    (Heliopolis, the On of the Bible). Mentu, or Mentu-ra, is represented as Ra with
                    the tall plumes of Amen, Atmu in a human form. Both cannot be distinguished from
                    Ra except that probably their attributes were more restricted, and while Mentu
                    seems to be within limits identical with Ra, the human form of Atmu may perhaps
                    hint a relation to Osiris.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    a play upon the name of the divinity (c∕. De Rouge, “Etudes,” 350, 351), but it
                    is more likely that Turn is here used as Osiris everywhere to indicate the
                    divine quality of the justified.</p></note></p>
                <p>Shu is light, and is a type of celestial force, for he is represented supporting
                    the goddess of heaven. Μ. de Rougé remarks that it is curious to find in this
                    ancient cosmogony the principle of force identified with the luminous principle
                    (“Etudes,” <hi rend="italic">Rev. Arch.,</hi> i. 235, 236). His figure is human
                    and he sometimes bears on his head the ostrich-feather, which, though the
                    initial of his name, must here have its symbolical sense of “truth.” The
                    relation of light and truth is not less remarkable than that of light and force.
                    Tefnet, associated with Shu in the cycle, is represented with the head of a
                    lioness. This is the most common compound form of Egyptian goddesses, as the
                    hawk-headed cf the gods. Both are connected with solar worship. The lioness was
                    probably chosen as the highest foπn of the family to which the luminous-eyed
                    cat, one of the most popular of the sacred animals, belonged.</p>
                <p>Seb stands at the hea∣l of the family of Osiris. He is represented in human form
                    like his cousort Nut. They are called ‘ ‘ father of the gods” and ‘‘ bearer of
                    the gods.” Seb was the god of the earth (De Rouge, <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
                    238), and Nut the goddess of heaven. Her name means the abyss, though curiously
                    the primordial abyss is called, in ch. xvii. of the <hi rend="italic">Ritual,
                    ηu,</hi> in the masculine <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> 359).</p>
                <p>Osiris, in Egyptian Hcsiri, is usually represented as a mummy, wearing the royal
                    cap of Upper Egypt, which may indicate the Thinite origin of his worship, or
                    that, as Horus and Seth were the special divinities of Upper and Lower Egypt, so
                    lie was particularly connected with the upper country. His cap is usually
                    flanked by ostrich plumes, which probably have a reference to Ma-t the goddess
                    cf truth and justice. The myth of Osiris is the most interesting because the
                    most human part of Egyptian mythology. It is impossible to attempt a full
                    account of it: the materials have yet to be gathered. We cannot accept the
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">On Isis and Osiris</hi> as representing the older
                    form of the myth. In different documents we seem to trace irs growth, and
                    notably do we find in those later than Dyn. XXII. the change due to the altered
                    theory of good and evil. Yet the general outlines are the same in what we may
                    ιeason-ably hold to be the earliest documents. It is these that are, as far as
                    possible, used here.</p>
                <p>Osiris is essentially the good principle: hence his name Un-nefer, the good
                    being, rather than the revealer of good (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Ancienne,</hi> 38). Like Ra he is the creator, and like him in perpetual warfare
                    with evil. His brother, or son, Typhon, Seth (Set), is his opponent. They are
                    light and darkness, physical good and evil, the Nile and the desert, Egypt and
                    the foreign land. Osiris is certainly moral good, Seth is to a certain extent
                    moral evil. Throughout the <hi rend="italic">Ritual</hi> they are in conflict
                    for right and wrong, for the welfare and destraction of the human soul. In ch.
                    xvii., which was preserved intact from a remote age, this conflict appears. Seth
                    is, however, not there distinctly named as the opponent of Osiris, except in the
                    glosses, which may be as old or (like the case of the Mishna and the Gemara)
                    older than the text, and once in the text he appears as joining with Horus his
                    adversary in accomplishing the final condition of the deceased who had reached
                    the abode of happiness (ver. 35); and on the other hand, one gloss explains the
                    executioner of souls to be Seth, but otherwise Horus the elder, brother of
                    Osiris, who is but a variation of the younger Horas (ver. 33). Yet the
                    opposition of Osiris and Seth is a perpetual combat. Osiris is vanquished. He is
                    cut in pieces and submerged in the water. Watched by his sisters, Isis his
                    consort and Ncphthys the consort of Seth, he revives. Horas his son avenges him,
                    and with the aid of Thoth, or reason, he destroys the power of Seth, but does
                    not annihilate him. The myth is a picture of the daily life of the sun,
                    combating darkness yet at last succumbing to it, to appear again in renewed
                    splendour, as the young Horus a solar god triumphs over Seth. It is also a
                    picture of human life, its perpetual conflict and final seeming destruction, to
                    be restored in the new youth of a brighter existence. In this view suffering is
                    not wholly evil, but has its beneficent aspect in the accomplishment of filial
                    good. There are two ways of explaining the origin of this myth. Either we may
                    regard Osiris as the sun of the night, and so the protector of those who pass
                    away into the realm of shades, or we may suppose that once taken as the type and
                    ruler of mankind in the after state, the hidden sun was naturally chosen to
                    represent him, the sun being with the Egyptians the source and governor of all
                    life. Those who make the solar idea the first form of the myth have to explain
                    its specially human aspect, and particularly why we see no such aspect in any
                    deep sense in the case of Atmu the sun of rhe night in the group of solar
                    divinities.</p>
                <p>It will be easily seen how such a story took ho’d of the affections of the
                    Egyptians. Osiris was the type of humanity, its struggles, its sufferings, its
                    temporary defeat, and its final victory. The living, and still mere the dead,
                    were identified with him. Under his name, without distinction of sex, they
                    passed into the hidden ρlaco <pb break="no"

                    be protected by him in their conflict with Seth and his genii, and to have their
                    final state determined by him as their judge. It was to Osiris that the prayers
                    and offerings for the dead were made, and all sepulchral inscriptions, except
                    those of the oldest period, are directly addressed to him. As Isis is a form of
                    the female principle, Osiris, the sun and the Nile, was considered in one phase
                    to be the male principle. The Osiris of Mendes was the name of this form, which
                    was more especially known by the name of Mendes.</p>
                <p>The three most famous of those more sacred animals which were worshipped as
                    individuals, not as a class, were the bulls Apis and Mnevis and the Mendesian
                    goat. Of these Apis and the Mendesian goat were connected with the worship of
                    Osiris. Manetho says that all these animals were first reckoned among the gods
                    under a very early Egyptian Pharaoh, Kaiechôs, in Egyptian Ka-kau, second king
                    of Dyn. 1I.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. de Rouge
                    has noticed that the name of this king, “the male of males” or “the bull of
                    bulls,” may be connected with the cultus of the sacred bulls, while that of
                    Binδthris, his successor, contains a symbol, the ram, interchangeable with the
                    goat, which makes it look like a second commemorative medal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Six Prern. Dyn.,</hi> 243, 244). If this be so the names of these early
                    Pharaohs must have been taken on their accession or on some remarkable event,
                    like the throne-names after the introduction of that second name. A change of
                    name during a king’s reign for a religious reason is seen in the case of the
                    sunworshipping Amenoph IV., who took the name of Khu-en-aten.</p></note> It is
                    very characteristic of the Egyptian religion that the reverence for Osiris
                    should have taken this grossly-material form.</p>
                <p>The bull Apis, who bears in Egyptian the same name as the Nile, Hilpi, was
                    worshipped at Memphis. Here Μ. Mariette discovered a series of the tombs of
                    these bulls, with tablets recording the reigns in which they were buried, and in
                    several cases further exact particulars of date, thus affording important
                    chronological evidence. Apis was considered to be the living emblem of Osiris,
                    and was thus connected with the sun and the Nile, and the chronological aspect
                    of both explains his being also connected with the moon. On the death of an
                    Apis, a successor was sought for and recognized by certain marks. He was then
                    inaugurated and worshipped during his lifetime. (See Aι ’ ιs. )</p>
                <p>Sarapis, or Serapis, in Egyptian Hesiri-Hapi, is the defunct Apis, who has become
                    Osiris. The great extension of the worship of Sarapis, after the importation of
                    his statue by Ptolemy I., was merely a development of long existing Egyptian
                    ideas. Hence the rapid spread and great popularity of this worship. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Serapis.)</hi></p>
                <p>The Mendesian goat had no special name. He is called the Ram. He was considered
                    an emblem of Ra and Shu as well as of Seb and Osiris, but probably he was
                    chiefly sacred to Osiris, and in his solar aspect, which would thus introduce
                    the relation to the more markedly solar gods. The seat of his worship was Mendes
                    in the eastern part of the Delta, where Dr Bιτιgsch has discovered a very
                    interesting stele of the reign of Ptolemy IL, Philadelphus, giving the history
                    of the finding and inauguration of a sacred ram, and of the honour paid to him
                    and to his temple. His worship was similar to that of Apis, but of a grosser
                    form, inasmuch as the goat or ram was a symbol of the productive force of
                    nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Isis, or Hes, represented as a woman bearing on her head her emblem the throne,
                    or the solar disk and cow's horns, is the female form of Osiris. Unlike Ra, the
                    Osiris family have consorts; but no one is so distinctly as Isis a counterpart
                    and of equal importance. Though the place of Isis is not as significant as that
                    of Osiris in the myth to which they belong, she is necessary to it, and this is
                    probably the reason why she attained an importance beyond the other Egyptian
                    goddesses except only Hathor, who is but another Isis.</p>
                <p>Seth, the Egyptian Set, usually called by the Greeks Typhon, is represented with
                    the head of a fabulous animal, having a pointed snout and high square ears. He
                    was the brother or son<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It has been usual to call Seth the brother of Osiris; Dr Brugsch prefers to
                    style him his son <hi rend="italic">(Hist.,</hi> 2 ed. p. 20, 22). This double
                    relationship is the key to the similar position of IIorus, and the identity of

                    of Egypt, and the chief of the powers which fought with the human soul in the
                    after life. He certainly represents physical evil. It would be easy to account
                    for his worship in Egypt were it not for his appearing as the enemy of gods as
                    well as of men. There is indeed something illogical in his holding a place in
                    the Pantheon, which gains consistency by his expulsion, though the consequent
                    confusion of moral and physical evil was detrimental to ethical ideas. It is
                    remarkable as showing the Egyptian notion of Seth while he was still worshipped,
                    that in the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, those whose names are composed with
                    his, Setee I. and II., and Set-nekht, use instead the name of Osiris. This seems
                    to have been sometimes done afterwards by a change in the inscriptions, but
                    still at the time when the tombs were first completed, and thus while the
                    reverence of Seth, as is shown by these royal names, was in full bloom (Lepsius,
                    <hi rend="italic">Erst. Aeg. Gotterkreis).</hi> The subsequent change of opinion
                    as to Seth, his identification with moral evil, and his consequent expulsion
                    from the Pantheon have been already noticed. In consequence his figure and name
                    are usually effaced on the monuments, and other gods take his place in the
                    cycles in which he had a position. In later times Seth is the enemy of all good,
                    feared and hated, but no longer reverenced. The date of the change is as yet
                    undetermined. It has been usually assigned to the Bubastite kings who composed
                    Dyn. XXII. Μ. Mariette has discovered the curious fact that one of those kings,
                    a hitherto unknown Osorkon, altered the figure of Seth in the legends of Ramses
                    II. at Tanis to that of a Set-Ra <hi rend="italic">(Musée</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Boulak,</hi> p. 273). Was this the beginning of the change?</p>
                <p>Nephthys, or Nebti, the sister of Osiris and Isis, and conscit of Seth, does not,
                    as far as the Egyptian documents tell us, share his character. It is rather as
                    the sister of Isis that she there appears, aiding her in her labours to recover
                    and revive Osiris. Thus like Isis she is a protector of the dead, and her figure
                    and worship escaped the fate of those of Seth.</p>
                <p>Horus, or Har, is in the cycles the son of Osiris and Isis. There is also a Horus
                    the elder, Haroëris, Har-oer, brother of Osiris, and a Horus the child,
                    Harpocrates, Har-pe-khruti, son of Osiris and Isis, and two other forms,
                    Har-Hut, the Horus of Hut or Apolhno-polis Magna, and Har-em-akhu, “Horus in the
                    horizon.” Horus is generally hawk-headed, and thus a solar god connected with
                    Ra. This connection is perhaps strongest in the form Har-em-akhu, worshipped at
                    Heliopolis sometimes even as Ra-Har-em-akhιι. The most interesting form is that
                    of Horus as the son and avenger of Osiris. Osiris being identified with the sun
                    of the night, Horus is naturally the sun of the day. From this identification
                    arose the idea of an infant Horus as the rising sun. As Horus took the place of
                    Osiris rn the contest with Seth, he became the elder Horus, to be on an equality
                    with his opponent, who seems offener the brother than the son of Osiris.
                    Specially Horus is the ruler of Upper Egypt, and the typical king of Egypt as
                    much as Ra. It is indeed so hard to distinguish Horus from Ra that it seems
                    impossible to hold any opinion but that they had their oιigiu in separate
                    religious systems.</p>
                <p>Hathor, Athor, or Hat-har, whose name means “the abode of Horus,” is hard to
                    distinguish from Isis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">Boulaq,</hi> 118, 119). Curiously she is more widely reverenced
                    than even Isis. She is really the female counterpart of Osiris. She was, like
                    him, worshipped throughout Egypt, and the great temple of Adfoo contains a list
                    of over three hundred names of the goddess in heι local forms (Dümichen,
                    ⅛f&lt;f. 20). Still more remarkably, in late times, the cow, here the symbol oi
                    Hathor, not seldom takes the place of the name of Osiris as applied to women
                    deceased: instead of taking the form of Osiris, they take that of Hathor <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> 21). It is characteristic of the Egyptian religion
                    that this irregularity should occur, and we may well hesitate to attempt to
                    define the place of Hathor in the Pantheon (Mariette, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musée</hi><hi rend="italic">Boulaq,</hi> 118), though Μ. Dümichen has made this
                    endeavour in a very interesting passage, that could be accepted had he given
                    sufficient authority from the monuments, and not shown traces of the influence
                    of Greek interpretation, besides too great a tendency to reason on the negative
                    evidence of the simple statements of the earlier monuments <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Phtha, or Ptah, the Egyptian Hephaestus, is the first to be noticed of the
                    divinities introduced into the chief cycles after their formation. His name is
                    one of the Egyptian words which can be recognized letter for letter in Hebrew
                    (∏ns “he opened, began,” and (Piel) “carved”); and the sense is similar. Ptah is
                    thus the divine architect <hi rend="italic">(ef.</hi> Brugsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire,</hi> 2d ed., 21). He was the chief god of Memphis, worshipped under a
                    human form, sometimes as a pigmy, supposed to be an embryo. He was the creative
                    force, but seemingly not as the sun. Though when connected with the local form
                    of Osiris worshipped at Memphis under the name Sekeri-Hcsiri, and then called
                    Ptah-Sekeri-Hesiri, he is sometimes hawk-headed, this is rather with a reference
                    to Horas than to Ra. Perhaps Professor Lepsius’s view that he is put before Ra
                    in the Memphite form of the cycle as an abstract idea of intellectual power is
                    the true one. If so, it seems probable that the worship of Ptah was of foreign
                    origin.</p>
                <p>Ammon, the Egyptian Amen, “the hidden,” probably owed his importance to the
                    greatness of Thebes, the chief Egyptian seat of his worship. He seems to derive
                    his characteristics from his association with other gods. As Amen-ra he takes
                    the qualities of <pb break="no"

                    mother,” he takes those of Min or Khern, the productive principle. Rarely he has
                    the ram-headed form that Greek notions would lead us to expect.</p>
                <p>Sebek, the crocodile-headed god, seems to have held a similar place to Seth.
                    There may have been a time when he was reverenced throughout Egypt, but in the
                    Graeco-Roman period he was a local divinity so disliked in most parts of Egypt
                    that, as already noticed, the Arsinoiite nome where he was worshipped does not
                    appear in the geographical lists. His sacred animal the crocodile was held in
                    abhorrence and hunted wherever Sebek was not reverenced (c∕ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi>. Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">IIish,</hi> 2d. ed., 106,

                <p>Thoth, or Tauut, is the head of the second cycle in the two principal forms of
                    the cycles. As the chief moon-god he thus takes an inferior place corresponding
                    to that of Ra. He is generally represented as ibis-headed, and frequently bears
                    the disk and crescent of the moon. He is the god of letters and of the reckoning
                    of time, and thus sometimes lias solar attributes. The ibis and the cynocephalus
                    were sacred to him. As the deity of wisdom he aids Horus in his conflict with
                    Seth, and records the judgment of the deceased before Osiris. He appears in
                    Phoenician mythology, though not at a period early enough for us to infer that
                    his worship was not borrowed from Egypt. Yet it is not impossible that here, as
                    in the case of Phtha, we have a trace of early Eastern influence. It is at least
                    remarkable that the great seat of his worship, Hermopolis Magna, bearing in
                    ancient Egyptian the civil name Sesennu, also Pe-seseuuu and Ha-sesennu, Eight,
                    or the Abode, or House of Eight, is called in Coptic cyΛΛOYΓf&gt; <hi

                    219). Was the change in the Coptic numeral due to an ancient form of the name of
                    this celebrated city?</p>
                <p>Ma-t, the goddess of truth, succeeds Thoth in a fragment of the list of the
                    dynasties of the gods in the Turin chronological papyrus. She is characterized
                    by the ostrich-feather, the emblem of truth, upon her head. She thus corresponds
                    to Shu, holding the corresponding place. Thoth is called her husband ( Lepsius,
                    <hi rend="italic">K'onigsbuch,</hi> taf. iii. 22), but she is not his consort at
                    Hermopolis (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 220). She is the
                    daughter of the sun. Her place in the myth of Osiris is very important, for it
                    is in her hall, where she is called the Two Truths, that the deceased are
                    judged.</p>
                <p>Anubis, or Anup, jackal-headed, probably held in one system the next place to
                    Ma-t. He belongs to the family of Osiris, being called the son of that divinity.
                    He presided over mummification. In the earliest sepulchral inscriptions the
                    divinity addressed is Anubis, not Osiris. No reason has yet been discovered for
                    this. There can be little doubt that Osiris was always intended, and that the
                    earliest inscriptions, for some reason connected with the Egyptian reticence as
                    to this divinity, address Anubis.</p>
                <p>The four genii of Amenti were inferior divinities connected with embalming. They
                    were called Amset, II dpi, Tiu-mut-f, and Kebh-senuf. The vases found in
                    Egyptian tombs which bear covers in the forms of the heads of these genii were
                    intended to contain the viscera of the mummy, as it was held to be of importance
                    that every part of the body should be preserved.</p>
                <p>The rest of the principal Egyptian gods may now be noticed as far as possible in
                    the order of their importance. It must, however, be remembered, that we are
                    likely to be misled by the abundant monuments of Uj&gt;ρer Egypt, and the
                    scantiness of those of Lower Egypt, and that therefore we cannot yet decide
                    which were insignificant members of the Pantheon.</p>
                <p>Chnuphis, or Khnum, represented with a ram’s head, and to whom the ram was
                    sacred, is the soul of the universe, and thus is spoken of as the creator
                    (Mariette, <hi rend="italic">Musée</hi><hi rend="italic">Boulaq,</hi> 113). He
                    was specially worshipped in Nubia, and at the First Cataract, with his consort
                    Sati, the goddess of the inundation (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Gcogr.
                    Insch.,</hi> i. 150, <hi rend="italic">seqq).</hi> He is closely connected with
                    Amen.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian Pan, the god of Panopolis, or Chemmis, was Min, or Khem, the
                    productive principle, a form of Osiris. He was worshipped at Panopolis with a
                    form of Isis as his consort (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 212, <hi
                    rend="italic">seqq.)</hi> It is remarkable that he was connected with Amen at
                    Thebes, for the myth of Amen and that of Osiris are singularly apart.</p>
                <p>Mendes, or Ba-neb-tet, is merely a local form of Osiris, lord ot Mendes,
                    connected with the worship of the sacred ram, or Mendesian goat (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 267, 268, 271, 272; <hi rend="italic">Records of the

                <p>Neith, or Nit, worshipped at Sais, identified by the Greeks with Athena, is one
                    of the few goddesses who held the first place in local worship. From the idea of
                    a supreme being, single and selfproducing, arose that of a female aspect of this
                    being. Thus Khnurn is called, as representing this being, “the father of
                    fathers, the mother of mothers” (Mariette, <hi rend="italic">Musée</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Boulaq,</hi> 113). This would suggest the personification of a
                    female principle. This principle seems specially represented by the higher
                    goddesses, like Neith, who is called “the mother who bare the sun, the first
                    born, but not begotten, born” (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Iuschr.,</hi>
                    i. 247). She wears the crown of Lower Egypt, where she was principally
                    worshipped.</p>
                <p>Pakht, or Sekhet, and Bast, are two forms of one goddess difficult to
                    distinguish. They are both usually lioness-headed, though sometimes they have
                    the head of the cat, their sacred animal. Pakht was worshipped at Memphis as the
                    consort of·Phtha; Bast seems to have held a place at her city Bubastis like that
                    of Neith at Sai's. The monuments identify Hatlιor with Bast, and Isis with both
                    Pakht and Bast, Hathor being called “Lady of Bubastis,” while Isis is spoken of
                    as “bringing misfortune as the goddess Pakht, bringing peace as the goddess
                    Bast” (Champ., <hi rend="italic">Not. Man.</hi> 192, <hi rend="italic">aρ.</hi>
                    Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Gcogr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 276). Pakht and Bast thus
                    represent a double nature, not unlike the two principles in the Osiris myth
                    (Mariette, <hi rend="italic">Musée</hi><hi rend="italic">Boulaq,</hi> 1106;
                    Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Inschr.,</hi> i. 275, 276). Pakht and Bast
                    were identified with Artemis (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 224,
                    275).</p>
                <p>Mut, the “mother/’ consort of Amen-ra at Thebes, is, as her name implies, another
                    embodiment of the female principle, though not in so important a form as Neith,
                    so far as our present knowledge goes.</p>
                <p>Khuns, worshipped at Thebes as the son of Amen and Mut, is a lunar divinity
                    wearing the disk and crescent of the moon, his hair being plaited in the
                    side-lock of a child. Sometimes he is hawkheaded, and thus connected with the
                    sun. As a divinity mainly lunar his inferior place is accounted for.</p>
                <p>The goddess Suben, identified with Eileithyia or Lucina, was worshipped at the
                    town Eilethyia. She was especially the mothergoddess, and the goddess of
                    southern Egypt; her symbol, that of maternity, was the vulture (Mariette, <hi
                    rend="italic">Musée</hi><hi rend="italic">Boulaq,</hi> 121).</p>
                <p>The goddess corresponding to Suben was Uati, or Buto, who was the protector of
                    the north, and whose emblem was the uraeus serpent.</p>
                <p>Onuris, or Anher, was the local deity of the ancient city of Thinis. His
                    functions are not clearly defined.</p>
                <p>Imhotep, identified by the Greeks with Aesculapius, was the son of I <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> tah and Pakht, and with them formed the triad of
                    Memphis. He is probably the god of the sciences, and similar to Thoth (Mariette,
                    iδicf. 117, 118).</p>
                <p>The Nile as a divinity bears the same name as the sacred Memphite bull, Ηέρΐ,
                    probably meaning “the concealed.” He is represented as a man with pendent
                    breasts, to indicate the fertility of the river. A hymn to the Nile by Enna, who
                    flourished under Menptah, the successor of Ramses II. (Dyn. XIX. ), shows how
                    completely even an inferior Egyptian divinity was identified with the supreme
                    god, and with the principal members of the Pantheon <hi rend="italic">(Select

                <p>The Egyptian divinities were frequently associated in triads, temples being
                    dedicated to one of these lesser cycles, consisting of father, mother, and
                    child. The child is almost always a son. 11 is extremely difficult to make out a
                    local triad in several cases, where there were two chief local divinities, or
                    where the chief divinity was a goddess. At Thebes the triad was Amen-ra, Mut,
                    and Khuus; at Memphis, Ptah, Pakht or Sekhet, and Imhotep; at Oιnbos there were
                    two triads, Sebek, Hathor, and Khuns, and Haruer, Tasen-nefert, and
                    Pnebto-pkhrut; the triad of Nubia and at Elephantine was Num, Sati, and the
                    goddess Ank-t; at Apollino-ρolis Magna, Har-Hut, Hat-liar, and Har-pkhrut; at
                    Latopolis, Num, Nebuut, and Har-pkhrut; at Hernιonthis, Munt, Ra-ta, and
                    Har-pkhrut; and Osiris, Isis, and Horus, throughout Egypt. The third member of
                    the triad always belongs to an inferior rank, and is sometimes a child-god
                    (khrut), as will be observed in the three cases in which Har-pkhrut
                    (Harpocrates) occurs, and the similar instance of Pnebto-pkhrut. Much of our
                    knowledge of the Egyptian triads is founded on late documents of the Ptolemaic
                    and Roman temples, and it is possible that the idea may have not been as much
                    developed in earlier times. The whole subject requires a careful
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian notions as to the cosmogony are too closely identified with
                    mythology to be very clearly defined. It seems, however, that they held that the
                    heavenly aby ss was the abode of the supreme deity, who there produced the sun
                    and the moon as well as the rest of the Pantheon. Yet it is stated in one gloss
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Ritual</hi> that the abyss itself was the supreme
                    deity, (c∕. De Rougé, “Etudes,” <hi rend="italic">Rev. Arch.,</hi> n.s., i. 235,
                    <hi rend="italic">seqqf</hi> The aspect of the passages of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ritual</hi> in which these ideas are developed seems as if due to the attempt
                    to introduce philosophical ideas into the mythology, as though the Egyptians had
                    some notion of the origin of things independent of that mythology.</p>
                <p>The worship of the Egyptian deities was public and <pb break="no"

                    tombs. Every town had at least one temple dedicated to the chief divinity of the
                    place, with certain associated gods, and usually, if not always, a living symbol
                    in the form of a sacred animal supposed to be animated by the chief local
                    divinity. The services were conducted by priests, and on occasions by the king,
                    and by scribes, who sometimes formed a college and lived at the temples, the
                    various duties of which required the services of learned men. It is probable
                    that the common people had a very small share in the religious services, the
                    most important of which took place in the smaller inner chambers, which could
                    never have admitted many worshippers. The outer courts, and still more the great
                    inclosures containing the whole group of temple-buildings, must, however, have
                    been the chief public resort for business and pleasure. There were no other
                    public buildings, or, apparently, market-places. Like the modern mosque, the
                    temple must have been the chief centre of the population.</p>
                <p>The worship in the tombs was not local. It was always connected with Osiris or a
                    divinity of the same group, and had the intention of securing benefits for the
                    deceased in the future state. It took place in the chapel of each tomb of the
                    wealthy; and though properly the function of the family, whose members
                    officiated, the inscriptions invite all passers-by, as they ascend or descend
                    the Nile, overlooked by the sepulchral grottoes, to say a prayer for the welfare
                    of the chief person there buried.</p>
                <p>The sacrifices were of animals and vegetables, with libations of wine, and
                    burning of incense. Human sacrifice seems to have been practised in early
                    periods. The monuments do not mention it, but Manetho speaks of its having been
                    abolished, at least at one place, by Amôsis, no doubt the first king of Dynasty
                    XV1II. The reference is probably to some barbarous usage during the great war
                    with the Shepherds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>According to Plutarch, Manetho stated that human sacrifices were anciently
                    practised at Eilethyia <hi rend="italic">(De Is.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Osir.</hi> i. cap. 73); whereas Porphyry says, on the

                    Abstiη.,</hi> p. 199). As, however, according to Porphyry they were sacrificed
                    to Hera, who would well correspond to Suben, goddess of Eilethyia, not to any
                    goddess of Heliopolis, it is probable that Heliopolis is an error for Eilethyia
                    (Ήλιου <hi rend="italic">τriκtι</hi> for Eιληθuiαs <hi rend="italic">r0λfi,</hi>

                    Porphyry, Amôsis substituted waxen figures for the victims. The figure called
                    the “Bride of the Nile,” now annually thrown into the river at the cutting of
                    the Can∙ιl of Cairo, is said to represent <hi rend="italic">a</hi> girl annually
                    sacrificed in former times.</p></note></p>
                <p>The origin and destiny of man in the Egyptian religion is now known to us on the
                    authority of its own documents, which in the main confirm what Greek writers had
                    already stated on the subject. The aspect of the Egyptian teaching is either
                    that of a simple theory, which was afterwards mythically interpreted, or of a
                    union of such a theory with a superstition existing side by side with it. In the
                    famous seventeenth chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Ritual</hi> it is possible,
                    as De Rouge has done with extraordinary skill, to extract from the text a
                    consistent theory which the glosses confuse by the mythological turn they give
                    to the simple statements of the text. Notwithstanding this difficulty, it is
                    sufficiently clear that the Egyptians attributed to the human soul a divine
                    origin, that they held that it was throughout life engaged in the warfare of
                    good and evil, and that after life its final state was determined by judgment
                    according to its doings on earth. Those who were justified before Osiris passed
                    into perpetual happiness, those who were condemned into perpetual misery. The
                    justified took the name of Osiris, the judge, under which they indeed already
                    appeared for judgment.</p>
                <p>Had this plain outline been left unfilled by the priests, the Egyptians might
                    have been credited with a lofty philosophy. Unfortunately, however, a thousand
                    superstitions took the place of the attempt to lead an honest life. In the tombs
                    we find every one who could pay for a sculptured record characterized as
                    justified, every mummy already an Osiris. How was this determined? Possibly
                    there was a council held, which decided that the deceased could be treated as
                    one who was certain of future happiness. It is, however, more probable that the
                    learning certain prayers and incantations, the performance of ceremonies, and
                    the whole process of embalming, together with the charms attached to the mummy,
                    and prayers said by those who visited the tomb, were held to secure future
                    happiness. In reading the <hi rend="italic">Ridual</hi> we are struck by the
                    small space given to man’s duties as compared with that filled by incantations
                    and charms. The human mind must have lost sight of the value of good and seized
                    upon the multifarious equivalents which needed nothing to be done by way of
                    either self-restraint from evil or active benevolence. Thus as we look at the
                    documents we see a noble idea lost in a crowd of superstitious fancies; as we
                    look at the Egyptians as they lived, we trace the effect of the indomitable
                    good, and yet find it always greatly alloyed with evil. The Egyptian idea of the
                    future state is the converse of that of Socrates. It is no little incident of
                    human weakness, like the request to sacrifice a cock to Aesculapius, which
                    injures but does not destroy a harmonious whole; a mere glimpse of truth is seen
                    through thick mists peopled with the phantoms of the basest superstition.</p>
                <p>In the long course of ages the Egyptian ideas as to the future state seem to have
                    undergone changes, not in themselves, but in the manner in which they were
                    regarded. The vast labour expended on the Pyramids, and their solid simplicity,
                    are in striking contrast with the elaborate religious representations of the
                    tombs of the kings of Dynasties XIX. and XX. So, too, the sculptures on the
                    walls of the tombs of subjects of the earlier kings, representing the everyday
                    life of duty and pleasure, give place to funereal and religious scenes in the
                    later periods. These were fashions, but they show the changed mood of the
                    national mind. It is only in a tablet of the age of the Ptolemies that Greek
                    ideas assert their predominance in a touching lament addressed from the land of
                    shades, which no longer speaks of active happiness, but in its place of
                    purposeless oblivion (Birch, “Two Tablets of the Ptolemaic Period,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Archceologia,</hi> xxxix. 22, 23).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laws and Government.—</hi> We are gradually gaining an insight
                    into the Egyptian laws. This is principally due to M. Chabas, the third volume
                    of whose <hi rend="italic">Melanges</hi><hi rend="italic">Égyptolo-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">giques</hi> mainly consists of essays, nearly all by himself, on
                    texts relative to the administration of justice under the Pharaohs. His general
                    results confirm the accuracy of what Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch state on the
                    subject. It was to be expected that their evidence would have been good as to
                    matters which could not have been easily misunderstood, and which must in the
                    case of Diodorus have been personally observed. In this matter the two sets of
                    authorities may fairly be combined.</p>
                <p>The government of Egypt was monarchical. It was determined as early as the rule
                    of Dynasty IL, according to Manetho, that women could reign. Accordingly we find
                    instances of queens regnant. Their rule, however, seems to have been disliked,
                    and they are passed over in the lists made under Dynasty XIX., when, it may be
                    observed, the royal family seems to have been affected by Shemite influences.
                    The royal power can scarcely have been despotic, although under certain kings it
                    became so. It is sufficient to compare Assyrian and Babylonian with Egyptian
                    history and documents to perceive a marked difference. The earliest monuments
                    indicate a powerful local aristocracy holding hereditary functions. Those of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n743/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0743-0720"/> the Empire (Dynasties XVTII.-XX.} scarcely
                    indicate any such class. Even the princes are no longer a royal clan, but the
                    children of the reigning sovereign. The whole system of government rests with
                    the king, who appoints all the functionaries and dismisses them at his pleasure.
                    Hence arose a vast and corrupt bureaucracy, to which the decay of Egypt may have
                    been mainly due. At all times the country was governed by nomarchs and lesser
                    officers. In the earliest period these were local magnates whose office was at
                    least sometimes hereditary, and whose interest it was to promote the welfare of
                    their districts. Under the Empire governments seem to have been mere places of
                    profit given by favour and held by force and corruption, according to the
                    Turkish method.</p>
                <p>The laws were administered by judges appointed by the king. It is certain that
                    commissions for an occasion were thus formed. We do not know that there were
                    judges appointed for life; but it is probable that such was the case, as it must
                    have been the duty of a class to be thoroughly acquainted with the written laws.
                    A legal scribe may, however, have been attached to each commission.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>AI. Chabas has given the
                    constitution of a tribunal under Dynasty XX. It was held at the great assizes of
                    Thebes, and presided over by the poliarch, with nine inferior judges, including
                    his three assessors, who were a royal controller, a majordomo, and another royal
                    controller, the Fist prophet of Amen-ra and an inferior prophet, a royal scribe,
                    a captain of cavalry, an ensign of the navy, and the commandant of the city. The
                    last was the prosecutor, and was himself condemned by the other judges on the
                    acquittal of the defendants <hi rend="italic">Mélanges,</hi> iii. i. 131,
                    &amp;&lt; ).</p></note> All the particulars of each case, though not necessarily
                    submitted in writing, were recorded, and the decision was written. The process
                    was conducted with great care, and the culprit examined on his oath. The
                    punishments probably were not extremely severe. For murder, but not for
                    manslaughter, death was the penalty. Adultery was severely punished, perhaps
                    rather by custom than by law. Theft was rigorously prosecuted. For sacrilegious
                    theft the criminal was punished with death. The laws relating to debt are not
                    yet well known. They appear to have been complicated by a system of loans and
                    pawning, and to have been subject to modifications. Of the tenure of land we
                    know little. The temple-lands seem to have been held in perpetuity, and this was
                    probably the case with private domains in the earliest period (De Rougé, <hi

                    as yet of the organization of the Egyptian army, but much of its arms and mode
                    of conducting warfare. It consisted from very early times of foreigners as well
                    as Egyptians. The Egyptian troops seem to have been a military caste, though not
                    in the strictest sense, and to have had certain lands allotted to them. There
                    were two main divisions of the army,—a chariot-force, in which each chariot
                    contained an archer and a charioteer, and was drawn by two horses; and a force
                    of foot-soldiers variously armed, chiefly heavy infantry, armed with shield and
                    spear, sword, axe, or mace, and light infantry, with bow, and axe or falchion,
                    as well as slingers. It may be noticed that fiint-tipped arrows were used in the
                    chase. We know nothing of the military manoeuvres, but it is evident that the
                    troops were drilled to move in formations, and that the art of besieging was as
                    well understood as by the Assyrians, in the mode of attacking the enemy’s fort
                    as well as in that of protecting the soldiers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manners and Customs.—</hi> The subjects of the walls of the
                    Egyptian tombs and the hieratic papyri tell us much of the domestic life of the
                    ancient people. The education in the earliest age seems to have been more manly
                    and more simple than in that of the Empire, when the college of a temple or the
                    miniature court of a great officer was the school instead of the estate of the
                    landed proprietor. This system, however, gave almost his only chance of advance
                    ment to a poor man’s son, for the very highest posts were open to the successful
                    scholar. (Cy. Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> 2d ed. 16, 17.) Circumcision
                    was practised from the earliest times, but apparently not as a religious rite,
                    and not until the earlier years of childhood had passed. Of the education of
                    girls there is no indication, but, as they afterwards shared the public life of
                    men, and even held posts of importance in the priesthood, it could not have been
                    neglected. It has not been proved that the Egyptians had any definite marriage
                    law. We find, however, that they married but one wife, who is termed the lady of
                    the house, and shares with her husband the honours paid to the deceased.
                    Concubinage was no doubt allowed, but it is seldom that we find any trace of
                    children more numerous than those of legitimate wives could be. The family of
                    Ramses II. is an instance of an Oriental household, and the fifty-two children
                    of Baba, whose tomb is found at Eilethyia, may also be cited, though the term
                    children may in this case include other descendants <hi rend="italic">{cf.</hi>
                    Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 176, 177). Ordinarily the aspect of the
                    family is that which it wears in civilized countries. The women were not
                    secluded, and, if they did not take the place of those of republican Rome, it
                    was due to faults of national character rather than the restraints of custom.
                    There was no separation into castes, although many occupations were usually
                    hereditary. As there was no noble caste, there was nothing to prevent the rise
                    of naturally able persons but the growth of the official class, which gradually
                    absorbed all power and closed the avenues to success. The corruption of this
                    class has been remarkably shown by the researches into the Egyptian
                    administration of justice by M. Chabas, who cites lists of robbers of tombs and
                    houses containing the names of scribes and priests, besides a higher grade of
                    servants <hi rend="italic">{Melanges,</hi> iii. i. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛A,seq&lt;p).</hi> There are other indications of the social condition of Egypt
                    under the Empire in the complaints of the lower class against the brigandage to
                    which they were subject on the part of persons who found means to interest the
                    highest functionaries, and so escape merited punishment. At the same time it is
                    to be remembered that they had the right of direct appeal to the king <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ibid.</hi> 173-216). This part of the picture of Egyptian life is
                    strikingly like that of China, and the dislike of foreigners is consistent with
                    the comparison. The lower class being uneducated, and for the most part very
                    poor, was held in contempt by the higher, and this was especially the case with
                    labourers and herdsmen. All handicrafts were considered unworthy of a gentleman,
                    and even the sculptor and painter were not raised above this general level. The
                    only occupations fit for the upper class were priestly, civil, and military, and
                    the direction of architectural and other works which required scientific
                    knowledge, not skill of hand. The servants were of a higher grade than the
                    labourers: not so the slaves, who were generally captives taken in war.</p>
                <p>The everyday life of the ancient Egyptians is abundantly represented in the
                    pictures of the tombs from the earliest monumental age to that of the Empire.
                    The rich passed much of their time in hospitality, giving feasts at which the
                    guests were entertained in various ways. The host and hostess sat together, as
                    did other married people, and the other men and women generally were seated
                    apart. The seats were single or double chairs, but many sat on the ground. Each
                    feaster was decked with a necklace of flowers by the servants, and a
                    lotus-flower was bound to the head, on which was also placed a lump of ointment.
                    Small tables were set before the guests, on which were piled meat, fruits,
                    cakes, and other food, and wine-cups were carried round. Before the repast,
                    hired musicians and dancers entertained the company, and often this seems to
                    have been the sole object of invitation.</p>

                <p>These two kinds of entertainment are precisely what are customary at the present
                    day in Egypt. Among the amusements of the ancient Egyptians was witnessing the
                    performance of various gymnastic feats. They had several games, one of which
                    probably resembled draughts. Under the old kingdom the chief occupations of the
                    rich seem to have been those of a country life, in its duties, the
                    superintendence of husbandry, of the taking stock of flocks and herds, and of
                    the shipment of produce, and the examination of fisheries, or again in seeing to
                    the efficient work of the people of the estate who were engaged in any craft;
                    and the pleasures of country life filled up the leisure. In ancient times Egypt
                    had far more cover for wild fowl than now. Thus we see from the subjects of the
                    tombs that the rich Egyptian was in the habit of going into the marshes in a
                    canoe, generally with some of his children, to spear the hippopotamus, or more
                    frequently to knock down birds with the curved throw-stick. In fowling, a cat
                    was sometimes used as a retriever. At other times he fished in his pond3, or
                    shot or coursed with hounds various animals of the antelope kind. Every rich man
                    in the age of the Empire had a chariot, generally drawn by two horses, which he
                    usually drove himself, standing up in it. The life of the ladies was not unlike
                    that of the meu, except that they only joined in the sports as spectators. They
                    seem to have passed their time in household matters, in visiting, and in the
                    simplest country pleasures. Occasionally they rode in heavy cars drawn by oxen.
                    Their manners appear to have been indolent and luxurious. Among the lower orders
                    the lighter work usually fell to the women. Both men and women led hard lives,
                    having scanty clothing and poor food; yet the genial climate, in which the wants
                    of the labourer must always have been few, rendered their condition not so
                    painful as one might suppose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language and Literature.—</hi> The language of the people was
                    the Egyptian, the later form of which, after they had become Christians, is
                    called Coptic. Comparative philology has not yet satisfactorily determined its
                    place. There can be no doubt that it is related to the Semitic family, but it
                    has not yet been proved to belong to it. The grammatical structure is distinctly
                    Semitic, and many roots are common to the Semitic languages. On the other hand,
                    the Egyptian has essential characteristics which detach it from this family. It
                    is monosyllabic, and its monosyllabism is not that from which scholars have
                    endeavoured to deduce Semitic, but rather such as would belong to a decayed
                    condition. This monosyllabism is like that of Syriac. Dr Brugsch strongly
                    affirms the affinity of the Egyptian to the Indo-Germanic as well as the Semitic
                    languages (7Zt√., 2 ed. 6), but the former relation has to be proved. It has
                    been supposed that the monosyllabism of the Egyptian is due to its having in
                    part originated from a Nigritian source <hi rend="italic">(Genesis of the Earth
                    and of Man,</hi> 2d ed. 255, <hi rend="italic">seqq.).</hi> Certainly this is a
                    characteristic of some Nigritian languages, and the want of any large agreement
                    in the vocabulary would be sufficiently explained by the changes that the
                    languages of savage nations undergo from the absence of a literature. It can
                    therefore scarcely yet be asserted with Dr Brugsch that the Egyptian has no
                    analogy to the African languages (Z.c.), by which, no doubt, he intends those
                    which have no Semitic element. The problem will probably be solved either by a
                    careful study of all the African languages which show traces of Semitic
                    structure side by side with those that are without such traces, or by the
                    discovery of the unknown element in Egyptian in the Akkadian or some other
                    primitive language of Western Asia, which cannot be called Semitic in the
                    recognized sense of the term. During its long history the language underwent
                    little change until it became Coptic. It had two dialects—those of Upper and
                    Lower Egypt, (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">ibid.);</hi> and by degrees a vulgar
                    dialect was formed which ultimately became the national language not long before
                    the formation of Coptic. One curious innovation in the Egyptian language was the
                    fashion under the Ramses family of introducing Semitic words instead of Egyptian
                    ones. From the manner in which these words are spelt it is evident that the
                    Egyptians at that time had no idea of a Semitic element in Egyptian, for they
                    always treat them as foreign words and retain the long foreign forms. The chief
                    change in Coptic was the introduction of many Greek words, especially to supply
                    the place of religious terms eliminated from the vocabulary. The inscribed and
                    written character of Egyptian was the hieroglyphic, a very complex system, which
                    expressed ideas by symbols or by phonetic sigus, syllabic and alphabetic, or
                    else by a combination of the two methods. From this was formed the hieratic, a
                    running hand, or common written form of the hieroglyphic, principally used for
                    documents written on papyrus. Its oldest records are not equal in age to the
                    earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions, but probably it is not much later in origin.
                    The demotic or enchorial writing is merely a form of hieratic used for the
                    vulgar dialect, and employed for legal documents from the time of Dyn. XXVI.
                    downwards. The Coptic is written with the Greek alphabet, with the addition of
                    six new letters and a ligature, the3e letters being taken from the demotic to
                    express sounds unknown to Greek. For further details see the article <hi

                <p>Much ancient Egyptian literature has come down to us, and it must be allowed that
                    from a literary point of view it has disappointed expectation. What it tells is
                    full of interest, but the mode of telling rarely rises to the dignity of style.
                    So unsystematic is this literature that it has not given us the connected
                    history of a single reign, or a really intelligible account of a single
                    campaign. The religious documents are still less orderly than the historical. It
                    is only by the severe work of some of the ablest critics during the last fifty
                    years that from those disjointed materials a consistent whole has been
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>The most important religious work is the <hi rend="italic">Funeral Ritual,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Book of the Dead,</hi> a collection of prayers of a magical
                    character referring to the future condition of the disembodied soul, which has
                    already been noticed. It has been published by Dr Lepsius <hi rend="italic">(Das

                    the utmost that a splendid critical faculty and an unusual mastery of language
                    could achieve to present parts of the work in the most favourable form. Still it
                    must remain a marvel of confusion and poverty of thought. Similar to the Ritual
                    is the Book of the Lower Hemisphere. The other religious works and inscriptions
                    are of a wider range. The temple inscriptions indeed are singularly stilted and
                    wanting in variety; but the papyri contain some hymns which are of a finer
                    style, particularly that to the Nile by Enna, translated by Canon Cook <hi
                    rend="italic">(Records of the Past,</hi> iv. 105), and that to Ra-Harmachis,
                    translated by Dr Lushington <hi rend="italic">(ibid,</hi> viii. 129) and
                    Professor Maspero <hi rend="italic">(Histoire Ancienne,</hi> 32, <hi
                    rend="italic">seqq.).</hi> The moral writings have a higher quality than the
                    religious, if we may judge from their scanty remains. The historical writings
                    fall into two classes according to their official or unofficial character. Those
                    that are official present the worst form of the panegyrical style, the others
                    are simple though wanting in method. The letters are of more interest, from
                    their lively portrayal of ancient Egyptian manners. In works of fiction there is
                    a greater degree of skill, and in the “Tale of Setnau” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Records of the Past,</hi> iv.) we even find touches of humour. Egyptian

                    as to the knowledge of science possessed by the ancient Egyptians. Their
                    progress in astronomy is evident from their observations, and still more from
                    the cycles they formed for the adjustment of different reckonings of time. Their
                    knowledge of geometry is attested by their architecture, and by a document on
                    the lands of the temple of Adfoo; and the annual inundation must have made
                    careful surveys and records necessary for the preservation of landed property.
                    Very great mechanical skill must have been needed to move the vast blocks used

                    landroutes, and then to place them in position. Considering the want of iron,

                    Egyptian architects are an enigma to modern science (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.,</hi> 2d ed. 52). Chemistry and metallurgy had also made great progress.
                    The hardening of the bronze tools with which they cut granite is a proof of
                    this, and the manner in which Moses destroyed the golden calf is another
                    evidence. Medicine and surgery were much studied, and the Egyptians were in
                    those sciences only inferior to the Greeks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arts.—</hi> Of the arts architecture claims the first place,
                    sculpture and painting being subservient to it among the Egyptians. Temple3 were
                    not built to contain statues, but statues were set up to adorn temples, of which
                    they were a part, and the walls were covered with sculptures and paintings which
                    had a decorative purpose. The group of these arts may therefore be considered as
                    a whole, and thus the principle they expressed may be best discovered. This
                    principle seems not to have been accidental, but a deliberate choice. The
                    country and climate afforded the best means of symbolizing the leading idea of
                    the Egyptian religion in the material forms of art. Life after death was that
                    idea, and it found expression in the construction of t0mb3 as lasting as the
                    rocks on which they rested. The pyramid is the first form of Egyptian art, and
                    modifications of its form, in truncated pyramids, are seen in the main outlines
                    of all later edifices or excavations. The decorations were subordinated to the
                    idea of commemoration, and thus every building was at once religious and
                    historical in its purpose. To this the Egyptian monuments owe a reserved
                    grandeur that is not affected by the symmetrical qualities of hieratic art nor
                    by the use of strongly contrasted colours. The art is always dignified, and the
                    colours, being seen either in strong sunlight outside the monuments, or in dim
                    twilight within them, are never glaring. The effect is exactly what was
                    intended, and would probably not have been produced had the art been more
                    advanced. In the whole range of ancient art Egyptian may take its place next
                    after Greek. Indeed in some instances it excels Greek, as when in animal forms
                    the natural is subordinated to the ideal. The lions from Gebel Barkal, presented
                    by the fourth duke of Northumberland to the British Museum, are probably the
                    finest examples of the idealization of animal forms that any age has
                    produced.</p>
                <p>From these observations we may form some idea of the character of the ancient
                    Egyptians. They were religious, but superstitious; brave without cruelty, but
                    tyrannical; hospitable, but not to strangers. In dress they were plain, but
                    luxurious in their ornaments; simple in their food, but given to excess in wine.
                    With respect for family ties, they were careless in their morals. The women
                    enjoyed great freedom, yet their character does not seem to have been higher
                    than it is among their descendants, subject to the lowering influence of the
                    hareem seclusion. Though the chief object of every man’s life was the
                    construction of his tomb, and the most costly personal event was the funeral,
                    the Egyptians were singularly mirthful, delighting in music and the dance, and
                    so given to caricature that even in the representation of a funeral ceremony the
                    artist cannot omit a ludicrous incident. The double origin of the race seems as
                    apparent here as in their physical type and their religion. The generous
                    qualities of the Shemite are being perpetually perverted by the inferior
                    impulses of the Nigritian; and again the bright elements of the Nigritian
                    character are strangely darkened by the shadow of the gloomy tendency of the
                    Shemite.</p>
                <p>The industrial arts were carried to a high degree of excellence by the ancient
                    Egyptians. In weaving and all the processes connected with the manufacture of
                    linen they have never been surpassed. Their pottery was excellent in quality and
                    suitable to its various purposes, and their glass but slightly inferior to that
                    of the Greeks. In the making of furniture, and instruments of music, vessels of
                    metal, alabaster, and other materials, arms and domestic implements, they showed
                    great taste and skill, and their influence on Greek art through the Phoenicians
                    is undoubted, though they did little more than afford suggestions to more
                    skilful artists of Hellas.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians had a great variety of musical instruments, the number of which
                    shows how much attention was paid to the art. Various kinds of harps are
                    represented, played with the hand, and of lyres, played with or without the
                    plectrum, and also a guitar. There are other stringed instruments, for which it
                    is difficult to find a modern name. The Egyptians had also flutes, single and
                    double pipes, the tambourine of various forms, cymbals, cylindrical maces, drums
                    of different kinds beaten with the hands or sticks, the trumpet, and the sacred
                    sistrum. The military music was that of the trumpet, drum, and cylindrical
                    maces; but almost all the instruments were used in the temple services. It is
                    impossible to form any conjecture as to the character of the music, unless we
                    may suppose that with many of the old instruments the modern inhabitants have
                    preserved its tradition. It may therefore be mentioned that they are ignorant of
                    harmony, but have fineness of ear and of execution. The musicians often sang or
                    danced while they played. The dances of both men and girls were of various
                    kinds, from what may be called feats of agility to slow movements. The dancers
                    were chiefly girls, whose performances evidently resembled those of their modern
                    successors, and whose clothing was even more transparent or scanty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ceremonies.—</hi> We know little of the private festivities of
                    the ancient Egyptians. In particular no representation of a marriage ceremony
                    has yet been discovered on the monuments. The greatest ceremony of each man’s
                    life was his funeral. The period of mourning began at the time of death, and
                    lasted seventy-two days or a shorter time. During this time the body was
                    embalmed and swathed in many linen bandages, the outermost of which was covered
                    with a kind of pasteboard, which represented the deceased, in the form we call a
                    mummy, as a labourer in the Elysian fields, carrying the implements of
                    husbandry, the face and hands being alone seen, and the rest of the body being
                    painted with subjects relating to the future state, and bearing a principal
                    inscription giving the name and titles of “the Osiris, justified.” The viscera
                    were separately preserved in vases having covers in the forms of the heads of
                    the four genii of Amenti. The mummy was inclosed in a case of wood having the
                    same shape, and this was again inclosed, when the deceased was a rich man,
                    within either another wooden case, or more usually a sarcophagus of stone,
                    sometimes of the same form as the mummy, but generally rectangular, or nearly
                    so. The mummy was then placed on a sledge, drawn by oxen or by men, and was
                    frequently taken <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n746/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0746-0723"/> to the bank of the river, or the shore of a
                    sacred lake, which was to be crossed in order to reach the place of burial. A
                    sacred boat carrying the mummy, attended by mourners, was towed by another boat,
                    and followed by others containing mourners, offerings, and all things necessary
                    for the occasion <hi rend="italic">{Ane. Eg.,</hi> pl. 83-86). On reaching the
                    tomb the sarcophagus was placed in a sepulchral chamber, usually at the bottom
                    of a pit, and offerings for the welfare of the deceased were made in a chapel in
                    the upper part of the tomb. One tomb sufficed for each family, and sometimes for
                    some generations; and in the case of the less wealthy, many were buried in the
                    sepulchral chambers of a single pit, above which was no structure or grotto. It
                    has been already noticed that,according to Diodorus, every one was judged by a
                    legal tribunal before the right of burial was permitted, and of this there may
                    be a survival in the practice of the modern Egyptians, which prescribes that a
                    witness muyt answer for the good character of the deceased before his burial <hi
                    rend="italic">{Modern Egyptians,</hi> ch. xxviii.). After the burial, offerings
                    were made at stated times each year by the family, and the chief inscription
                    begged the passer-by to say a prayer for the good of the inhabitant of the tomb.
                    These customs led to many abuses. The maintenance of the costly prescribed
                    offerings must have been most inconvenient, and for this and other purposes the
                    burial-grounds were peopled by a tribe of hungry professional embalmers and
                    lower priests, who made their living not only by their profession but also by
                    fraud and even theft. Yet we must admire the generosity with which the Egyptians
                    lavished their riches upon the most tender form of affection. They were repaid
                    not merely by a natural satisfaction, but also by the wholesome recognition that
                    there are unselfish and unproductive uses for wealth.</p>

                <p>Of the present population of Egypt, the Muslims constitute seven-eighths, and
                    nearly four-fifths of that of the metropolis; and to this class, and more
                    particularly to the people of Cairo, the following sketch of personal
                    characteristics and customs will relate, save in some few cases, which will be
                    distinguished from the rest.</p>
                <p>Tn describing the personal characteristics of this remarkable people, Mr Lane, in
                    the first chapter of <hi rend="italic">The Manners and Customs of the Modern
                    Egyptians</hi> (which was written just before European influence was felt in the
                    country, and still deservedly ranks as the only book of authority on the
                    subject), says :—</p>
                <p>“In general the Muslim Egyptians attain the height of about 5 feet 8 or 5 feet 9
                    inches. Most of the children under 9 or 10 years of age have spare limbs and a
                    distended abdomen; but as they grow up their forms rapidly improve. In mature
                    age most of them are remarkably well-proportioned; the men muscular and robust;
                    the women very beautifully formed, and plump; and neither sex is too fat. I have
                    never seen corpulent persons among them, excepting a few in the metropolis and
                    other towns, rendered so by a life of inactivity. In Cairo, and throughout the
                    northern provinces, those who have not been much exposed to the sun have a
                    yellowish but very clear complexion, and soft skin; the rest are of a
                    Considerably darker and coarser complexion. The people of Middle Egypt are of a
                    more tawny colour, and those of the more southern provinces are of a deep
                    bronze, or brown complexion—darkest towards Nubia, where the climate is hottest.
                    In general the countenance of the Muslim Egyptians (I here speak of the <hi
                    rend="italic">men)</hi> is of a line oval form: the forehead of moderate size,
                    seldom high, but generally prominent; the eyes are deep sunk, black and
                    brilliant; the nose is straight, but rather thick; the mouth well-formed; the
                    lips are rather full than otherwise; the teeth particularly beautiful; the beard
                    is commonly black and curly, but scanty. 1 have seen very few individuals of
                    this race with grey eyes; or rather, few persons supposed to be of this race;
                    for I am inclined to think them the offspring of Arab women by Turks, or other
                    foreigners. The Fellaheen, from constant exposure to the sun, have a habit of
                    halfshutting their eyes; this is also characteristic of the Bedawees. Great
                    numbers of the Egyptians are blind in one or both eyes. They generally shave
                    that part of the cheek which is above the lower jaw, and likewise a small space
                    under the lower lip, leaving, however, the hairs which grow in the middle under
                    the mouth; or, instead of shaving these parts, they pluck out the hair. They
                    also shave a part of the beard under the chin. Very few shave the rest of their
                    beards, and none their moustache. The former they suffer to grow to the length
                    of about a hand’s-breadth below the chin (such at least is the general rale, and
                    such was the custom of the Prophet), and their moustache they do not allow to
                    become so long as to incommode them in eating and drinking. The practice of
                    dyeing the beard is not common; for a grey beard is much respected. The
                    Egyptians shave all the rest of the hair, or leave only a small tuft (called ‘
                    shoosheh’) upon the crown of the head From the age of about 14 to that of 18 or
                    20 [the women], are generally models of beauty in body and limbs; and in
                    countenance most of them are pleasing, and many exceedingly lovely; but soon
                    after they have attained their perfect growth, they rapidly decline.” The
                    relaxing nature of the climate, and other predisposing causes, contribute to
                    render many of them absolutely ugly at the age of 40. “In the Egyptian females
                    the forms of womanhood begin to develop themselves about the ninth and tenth
                    year: at the age of 15 or 16 they generali}’ attain their highest degree of
                    perfection. With regard to their complexions, the same remarks apply to them as
                    to the men, with only this difference, that their faces, being generally veiled
                    when they go abroad, are not quite so much tanned as those of the men. They are
                    characterized, like the men, by a fine oval countenance, though in some
                    instances it is rather broad. The eyes, with very few exceptions, are black,
                    large, and of a long almond-form, with long and beautiful lashes, and an
                    exquisitely soft, bewitching expression—eyes more beautiful can hardly be
                    conceived: their charming effect is much heightened by the concealment of the
                    other features (however pleasing the latter may be), and is rendered still more
                    striking by a practice universal among the females of the higher and middle
                    classes, and very common among those of the lower orders, which is that of
                    blackening the edge of the eyelids both above and below the eye, with a black
                    powder called ‘ kohl. ’”</p>
                <p>Both sexes, but especially the women, tattoo several parts of the person, and the
                    latter stain their hands and feet with the red dye of the hinnè.</p>
                <p>The dress of the men of the upper and middle classes consists of cotton drawers,
                    and a cotton or silk shirt with very wide sleeves. Above these are generally
                    worn a waistcoat without sleeves, and a long vest of silk, called kaftan, which
                    has hanging sleeves, and reaches nearly to the ankles. The kaftan is confined by
                    the girdle, which is a silk scarf, or cashmere or other woollen shawl. Over all
                    is worn a long cloth robe, the gibbeh (or jubbeh) somewhat resembling the kaftân
                    in shape, but having shorter sleeves, and being open in front. The dress of the
                    lower orders is the shirt and drawers, and waistcoat, with an outer shirt of
                    blue cotton or brown woollen stuff; some wear a kaftân. The head-dress of all is
                    the turban wound round a skullcap. This cap is usually the red cloth fez, or
                    tarboosh, but the very poor wear one of coarse brown felt, and are often without
                    the turban. Many professions and religions, Ac., are distinguished by the shape
                    and colour of the turban, and various classes, and particularly servants, are
                    marked by the form and colour of their shoes; but the poor <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0747-0724"/> go usually barefoot. The ladies wear a shirt and
                    drawers, a very full pair of silk trousers, and a close-fitting vest with
                    hanging sleeves and skirts, open down the front and at the sides, and long
                    enough to turn up and fasten into the girdle, which is generally a cashmere
                    shawl; a cloth jacket, richly embroidered with gold, and having short sleeves,
                    is commonly worn over the vest. The hair in front is combed down over the
                    forehead and cut across in a straight line; behind it is divided into very many
                    small plaits, which haug down the back, and are lengthened by silken cord3, and
                    often adorned with gold coins and ornaments. A small tarboosh is worn on the
                    back of the head, sometimes having a plate of gold fixed on the crown, and a
                    handkerchief is tastefully bound round the temples. The women of the lower
                    orders have trousers of printed or dyed cotton, and a close waistcoat. All wear
                    the long and elegant head-veil. This is a simple “breadth” of muslin, which
                    passes over the head and hangs down behind, one side being drawn forward over
                    the face in the presence of a man. A lady’s veil is of white muslin, embroidered
                    at the ends in gold and colours; that of a person of the lower class is simply
                    dyed blue. In going abroad the ladies wear above their indoor dress a loose robe
                    of coloured silk without sleeves, and nearly open at the sides, and above it a
                    large enveloping piece of black silk, which is brought over the head, and
                    gathered round the person by the arms and hands on each side. A face-veil
                    entirely conceals the features, except the eyes; it is a long and narrow piece
                    of thick white muslin, reaching to a little below the knees. The women of the
                    lower orders have the same out-dυor dress of different materials and colour.
                    Ladies use slippers of yellow morocco, and abroad, inner boots of the same
                    material, above which they wear, in either case, thick shoes, having only toes.
                    The poor wear red shoes, very like those of the men. Among the upper classes,
                    however, the dress is rapidly becoming assimilated to that of Europeans in its
                    most preposterous form.</p>
                <p>In religion the Muslim Egyptians are Sunnees, professing the creed which is
                    commonly termed “orthodox,” and are principally of the persuasion of the
                    Shàfe’ees, whose celebrated founder, the imam Esh-Shâfe’ee, is buried in the
                    great southern cemetery of Cairo. Many of them are, however, Hanafees (to which
                    persuasion the Turks chiefly belong), and in parts of Lower, and almost
                    universally in Upper, Egypt, Mâlikees.</p>
                <p>The civil administration of justice is conducted in four principal courts of
                    judicature,—that of the Zâbit, or chief of the police; where trivial cases are
                    summarily disposed of; the Divan el-Khedivi, in the citadel, iu which the
                    khedive or his deputy presides, and where judgment is given in cases which
                    either do not require to be referred to the two other courts yet to be
                    mentioned, or which do not fall within their province; the Divan el-Mahkemeh,
                    the court of the cadi (kàdee), or chief judge, who must be a Hanafee, and who
                    was formerly a Turk sent annually from Constantinople, but is now appointed by
                    the khedive, and paid a fixed salary of 4000 napoleons a year; and that of the
                    muftee of the Hanafees, or chief doctor of the law, who decides all cases of
                    difficulty. There are besides five minor mahkemehs, or courts, in Cairo, and one
                    in each of the neighbouring towns of Boolak and Masr El-’Ateekah, from which
                    cases are always referred to the court of the kâdee; and each country town has a
                    native kàdee, whose authority is generally sufficient for the villages around.
                    The Council of the ’Ulemà, or learned men, consists of the sheykh, or religious
                    chief, of each of the four orthodox persuasions, the sheykh of the great mosque
                    called the Azhar, who is of the persuasion of the Shâfe’ees, aud is sometimes
                    its sheykh, the kàdee, and the chief (nakeeb) of the Shereefs, or descendants of
                    the Prophet, with several other persons. This body was until lately very
                    powerful, but now has little influence over the khedive. Cairo is divided into
                    quarters (Hàrah), each of which has its sheykh, who preserves order among the
                    people; aud the whole city is partitioned into eight larger divisions, each
                    having a sheykh called Sheykh et-Tumn. Various trades also have their sheikhs or
                    chiefs, to whom reference is made in disputes respecting the craft; and the
                    servants have similar heads who are responsible for their behaviour. The country
                    is divided into governments, as before stated, each presided over by a Turkish
                    officer, having the title of mudeer, and subdivided into districts under the
                    control of native officers, bearing the titles “Mamoor” and “Nâzir.” A
                    responsible person called Sheykh el-Beled (or “sheykh of the town” or “village”)
                    presides over each small town and village, and is a native of the place. It must
                    also be mentioned that the Sa’eed, or Upper Egypt, is governed by a pasha, whose
                    residence is at Asyoot. Notwithstanding the consistent, able, and in many
                    respects commendable, code of laws which has been founded on the Korân and the
                    Traditions, the administration of justice is lamentably faulty. As is the custom
                    throughout the East, judgment in Egypt is usually swayed by bribes, and a poor
                    man’s case is generally hopeless when his adversary is rich. To this rule there
                    have been some notable exceptions, and the memory of a few virtuous judges is
                    cherished by the people; but such instances are very rare. The moral and civil
                    laws observed by the Muslim Egyptians, being those of El-Islàm, will be noticed
                    elsewhere. A great abuse formerly existed in Egypt in the system of consular
                    jurisdiction. Natives were compelled to sue a foreigner before the latter’s
                    consul, and in nine cases out of ten lost their cause. Similarly it was very
                    difficult for a foreigner of one nation to obtain justice against one of another
                    nation at the latter’s consulate. This abuse has now been done away. At the
                    instance of Nubar Pasha, and after the deliberations of a European commission,
                    three Courts of First Instance at Alexandria, Cairo, and Ismaïlia, and a Court
                    of Appeal at Alexandria, were established in 1876, presided over by mixed
                    benches of Europeans and natives, the former being the majority, and employing a
                    new code based on the <hi rend="italic">Code Napoleon,</hi> with such additions
                    from Muslim law as were possible. These courts decide all cases between the
                    Government or native subjects and foreigners, and between foreigners of
                    different nationalities; and there can be no doubt that they will exercise a
                    great influence for good on the administration of justice in Egypt. It is to be
                    hoped that in course of time they may supersede the old native system in all
                    causes. At present they do but supersede the consular system.</p>
                <p>It is very worthy of notice, that in Cairo, as in some other Muslim cities, any
                    one may obtain gratuitously an elementary education, and he who desires the
                    fullest attainable education may receive that also without the payment of a
                    single fee, by joining a class of students in a collegiate mosque. The
                    elementary instruction which most boys receive consists chiefly of reading, and
                    learning the Koràn by heart; day-schools, as charitable institutions, abound in
                    Cairo, and every town possesses its school; a trifling fee to the fikee (or
                    master) is the only expense incurred by the scholars. Girls are seldom taught
                    anything beyond needlework. The children of both sexes, except those of the
                    wealthy, have generally a very dirty and slovenly appearance; and often
                    intentional neglect is adopted to avert the effects of the “evil eye,” of which
                    the Egyptians entertain great dread. The children of the upper classes are
                    excessively indulged, while the poor entirely neglect their offspring. The
                    leading doctrines of El-Islàm, as well as hatred for all religions but their
                    own, and a great reverence for their parents and the aged, are early
                    inculcated.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0748-0725"/>
                <p>This deference towards parents cannot fail to strike every foreigner who visits
                    Egypt, and does not cease with the children’s growth, presenting an example well
                    worthy of imitation in the West. Circumcision is observed at about the age of
                    five or six years, when the boy is paraded, generally with a bridal procession,
                    on a gaily caparisoned horse, and dressed in woman’s clothes. Some parents,
                    however, and most of the learned, prefer a quieter and less expensive ceremony
                    <hi rend="italic">{Modern Egyptians,</hi> chap, xxvii.).</p>
                <p>It is deemed disreputable for a young man not to marry when he has attained a
                    sufficient age; there are therefore few unmarried men. Girls, in like manner,
                    marry very young, some even at ten years of age, and few remain single beyond
                    the age of sixteen; they are generally very prolific. The bridegroom never sees
                    his future wife before the wedding night, an evil which is somewhat mitigated by
                    the facility of divorce. A dowry is always given, and a marriage ceremony
                    performed by a fikee (a schoolmaster, or one who recites the Koràn), in the
                    presence of two witnesses; the ceremony is very simple, but constitutes a legal
                    marriage. The bridal of a virgin is attended with great festivity and rejoicing,
                    a grandee’s wedding sometimes continuing eleven days and nights. On the last
                    day, which should be that terminating with the eve of Friday, or of Monday, the
                    bride is taken in procession to the bridegroom’s house, accompanied by her
                    female friends, and a band of musicians, jugglers, wrestlers, ⅛c. As before
                    stated, a boy about to be circumcised joins in such a procession, or,
                    frequently, a succession of such boys. A Muslim is allowed by his religion four
                    wives; but advantage is rarely taken of this licence, and very few attempt to
                    keep two wives in one house; the expense and discomfort which polygamy entails
                    act, therefore, as a restriction to its general adoption. A man may, however,
                    possess any number of concubine slaves, who, though objects of jealousy to the
                    legal wife, are yet tolerated by her in consideration of her superior position,
                    and conceded power over them, a power which she often uses with great tyranny;
                    but certain privileges are possessed by the concubine, especially if she have
                    born a son to her master. Such slaves are commonly kept only by grandees, the
                    generality of the Muslin; Egyptians being content with one wife. A divorce is
                    rendered obligatory by the simple words “Thou art divorced,” and a triple
                    divorce is irrevocable under ordinary circumstances. The hareem system of
                    appointing separate apartments to the women, and secluding them from the gaze of
                    men, is observed in Egypt as in other Muslim countries, but less strictly. Mr
                    Lane <hi rend="italic">{ibid.</hi> ch. vi.) says— “I believe that in Egypt the
                    women are generally under less restraint than in any other country of the
                    Turkish empire; so that it is not uncommon to see females of the lower orders
                    flirting and jesting with men in public, and men laying their hands upon them
                    very freely. Still it might be imagined that the women of the higher and middle
                    classes feel themselves severely oppressed, and are much discontented with the
                    state of seclusion to which they are subjected; but this is not commonly the
                    case; on the contrary, an Egyptian wife who is attached to her husband is apt to
                    think, if he allow her uuusual liberty, that he neglects her, and does not
                    sufficiently love her; and to envy those wives who are kept and watched with
                    greater strictness.” The females of an Egyptian household never sit in the
                    presence of the master, but attend him at his meals, and are treated in every
                    respect as inferiors. The mother, however, forms a remarkable exception to this
                    rule; in rare instances, also, a wife becomes a companion to her husband. On the
                    other hand, if a pair of women’s shoes are placed outside the door of the hareem
                    apartments, they are understood to signify that female visitors are within, and
                    a man is sometimes thus excluded from the upper portion of his own house for
                    many days. Ladies of the upper or middle classes lead a life of extreme
                    inactivity, spending their time at the bath, which is the general place of
                    gossip, or in receiving visits, embroidering, and the like, and in absolute <hi
                    rend="italic">dolce</hi><hi rend="italic">far nicnte.</hi> It is therefore no
                    cause for wonder that their tone of morals is generally low. Both sexes are
                    abstemious in their food, though fond of pastry, sweetmeats, and fruit. The
                    principal meals are breakfast, about an hour after sunrise; dinner, or the
                    mid-day meal, at noon; and supper, which is the chief meal of the day, a little
                    after sunset. Coffee is taken at all hours, and is, with a pipe, presented at
                    least once to each guest. Tobacco is the great luxury of the men of all classes
                    in Egypt, who begin and end the day with it, and generally smoke all day with
                    little intermission. Many women, also, especially among the rich, adopt the
                    habit. Men who can afford to keep a horse, mule, or ass, are very seldom seen to
                    walk, and numberless excellent asses are to be hired in Cairo. Ladies always
                    ride asses and sit astride. The poorer classes are of course unable to observe
                    the hareem system, but the women are in general carefully veiled. Some of them
                    keep small shops, and all fetch water, make fuel, and cook for their households.
                    The food of the poor is very meagre; flesh meat is rarely tasted by them, and
                    (besides bread) dates, raw cucumbers, and onions are their common food, with
                    soaked beans, roasted ears of Indian corn, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In their social intercourse the Muslim Egyptians are regular, and observe many
                    forms of salutation aud much etiquette; yet they are very affable, entering into
                    conversation with strangers at shops and elsewhere. Their courtesy and dignity
                    of manner are very striking, and are combined with ease and a fluency of
                    discourse. Of their mental qualifications Mr Lane(⅛ι'(Z. ch. xiii.) remarks—“The
                    natural or innate character of the modern Egyptians is altered, in a remarkable
                    degree, by their religion, laws, and government, a3 well as by the climate and
                    other causes; and to form a just opinion of it is therefore very difficult. We
                    may, however, confidently state that they are endowed, in a higher degree than
                    most other people, with some of the more important mental qualities,
                    particularly quickness of apprehension, a ready wit, and a retentive memory. In
                    youth they generally possess these and other intellectual powers; but the causée
                    above alluded to gradually lessen their mental energy.” Their principal virtues
                    are piety and strong religious feeling, a strict observance of the injunctions
                    of El-Islâm, and a constantly professed sense of God’s presence and over-ruling
                    providence, combined, however, with religious pride and hypocrisy. Their common
                    discourse is full of asseverations and expressions respecting sacred things,
                    often, however, used with a levity which it is difficult for a person
                    unacquainted with their feelings easily to reconcile with their respect for God.
                    They entertain an excessive reverence for their Prophet; and the Korân is
                    treated with the utmost respect— never, for example, being placed in a low
                    situation—and this is the case with everything they esteem holy. They are
                    fatalists, and bear calamities with perfect resignation to the Divine will.
                    Their filial piety and respect for the aged have been before mentioned, and
                    benevolence and charity are conspicuous in their character; poverty is therefore
                    not accompanied by the distressing circumstances which too frequently attend it
                    in Europe. Humanity to dumb animals is another virtue, and cruelty is openly
                    discountenanced in their streets, even to unclean animals; this is, however,
                    unfortunately wearing off in consequence of their intercourse with Franks. Their
                    affability, cheerfulness, and hospitality are remarkable, as well as frugality
                    and temperance in food and drink, scrupulous cleanliness, a love of country, and
                    honesty in the payment of debt. It should <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0749-0726"/> be added, however, that the Egyptians rarely, if
                    ever, exercise their social virtues but towards persons of their own persuasion
                    and country. Their vices are indolence, obstinacy, and licentiousness,
                    especially among the women, cupidity (mitigated by generosity), envy, a
                    disregard for the truth, and a habit of cursing. Murders, and other grave crimes
                    of this nature, are rarely committed, but petty thefts are very common.</p>
                <p>“The Arabic spoken by the middle and higher classes in Cairo is generally
                    inferior, in point of grammatical correctness and pronunciation, to the dialects
                    of the Bedawees of Arabia, and of the inhabitants of the towns in their
                    immediate vicinity, but much to be preferred to those of Syria, and still more
                    to those of the Western Arabs” (Lane, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> ch. ix.). The
                    language varies in Upper and Lower Egypt, and is more correct inland than near
                    the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>In the decay of Arab literature, Cairo still holds the chief place as a seat of
                    learning, and its university, the Azhar, is undoubtedly the first of the Eastern
                    world. Its professors teach “grammatical inflexion and syntax, rhetoric,
                    versification, logic, theology, the exposition of the Kur-ân, the Traditions of
                    the Prophet, the complete science of jurisprudence, or rather of religious,
                    moral, civil, and criminal law, which is chiefly founded on the Kur-ân and the
                    Traditions, together with arithmetic as far as it is useful in matters of law.
                    Lectures are also given on algebra, and on the calculations of the Mohammadan
                    calendar, the times of prayer, Ac.” (Lane, <hi rend="italic">ibidj).</hi> The
                    students, as already remarked, pay no fees, and the professors receive no
                    salaries. The latter maintain themselves by private teaching, and by copying
                    manuscripts, and the former in the same manner, or by reciting the Korân. The
                    students are now said to amount to the number of 11,000. Except the professors
                    of literature, few Egyptians are taught more than to read and write; and of
                    these, still fewer can read and write well. The women, as before mentioned, are
                    very rarely taught even to read.</p>
                <p>Science is but little studied, and barbers generally practise medicine and
                    surgery. Mehemet Ali endeavoured to improve this state of things, by sending
                    young men to Europe for the purpose of scientific study, and by establishing
                    various schools, with the same object, in Egypt. His improvements have been
                    continued by the present khedive, Ismail Pasha, with some success.</p>
                <p>In common with other Muslims, those of Egypt have very many superstitions, some
                    of which are peculiar to themselves. Tombs of saints abound, one or more being
                    found in every town and village; and no traveller up the Nile can fail to remark
                    how every prominent mountain has the sepulchre of its patron saint. The great
                    saints of Egypt are the imâm Esh-Shâfe’ee, founder of the persuasion called
                    after him, the seyyid Ahmad El-Bedawee, and the seyyid Ibrâheem Ed-Dasυokee,
                    both of whom were founders of orders of dervishes. The former of these two is
                    buried at the town of Tanta, in the Delta, and his tomb attracts mauy thousands
                    of visitors annually to his principal festival; the latter is also much revered,
                    and his festival draws together, in like manner, great crowds to his birthplace,
                    the town of Ed-Dasook. But, besides the graves of her native saints, Egypt
                    boasts of those of several members of the Prophet’s family; the tomb of the
                    seyyideh Zeyneb, daughter of ’Alee, that of the seyyideh Sekeeneh, daughter of
                    El-Hoseyn, and that of the seyyideh Nefeeseh, great-grand-daughter of El-Hasan,
                    all of which are held in high veneration. The mosque of the Hasaneyn (or that of
                    the “two Hasans ”) is the most reverenced shrine in the country, and is believed
                    to contain the head of El-Hoseyn. As connected with the superstitious practices
                    of Egypt, dervishes must be mentioned, of whom there are many orders found in
                    that country, the following being the most celebrated :—(1) the Rifâ’eeyeh, and
                    their sects the ’Ilwâneeyeh and Saadeeyeh; (2) the Kâdireeyeh; (3) the
                    Ahmedeeyeh, or followers of the seyyid Ahmad El-Bedawee, and their sects the
                    Beiyoomeeyeh, Shaarâweeyeh, Shinnâweeyeh, and many others; and (4) the
                    Barâhimeh. or followers of the seyyid Ibrâheem Ed-Dasookee. These are all
                    presided over by a direct descendant of the caliph Aboo-Bekr, called the Sheykh
                    El-Bekree. The Saadeeyeh are the most famous for charming and eating live
                    serpents, Ac., and the ’Ilwâneeyeh for eating fire, glass, Ac. The Egyptians
                    firmly believe in the efficacy of charms, a belief which is associated with that
                    in an omnipresent and overruling Providence. Thus the doors of houses are
                    inscribed with sentences from the Koran, or the like, to preserve from the evil
                    eye, or avert the dangers of an unlucky threshold; similar inscriptions may be
                    observed over most shops, while almost every one carries some charm about his
                    person. Among so superstitious a people, with whom, as we have already seen,
                    science is in a very low state, it is not to be wondered that the so-called
                    sciences of magic, astrology in the place of astronomy, and alchemy in that of
                    chemistry, are in a comparatively flourishing condition.</p>
                <p>Since the time of the Turkish conquest, the arts in Egypt have rapidly fallen
                    into decay; this is partly attributable to the deportation of most of the
                    skilled artificers of Cairo to Constantinople by the sultan Selim, but it is
                    mainly owing to the misrule of the Turkish pashas, who have successively
                    domineered over this unfortunate country. Cairo contains the most splendid
                    specimens of Arab architecture of any part of the Arabian empire; but at present
                    new buildings are erected after the Constantinopolitan model, or, what is still
                    worse, the purely European—both styles immeasurably inferior to the Arab, and
                    very ill suited to the requirements of the climate. In like manner, every other
                    kind of native art is gradually perishing; and it is to be feared that even
                    should the people be relieved from oppression and bad government, their industry
                    will be encouraged rather to adopt imaginary improvements imported from Europe,
                    than to cultivate the beautiful taste of their ancestors. The manufactures of
                    the present inhabitants of Egypt are generally inferior to those of other
                    Eastern nations, their handicrafts are clumsy, and the inevitable results of
                    tyranny are everywhere evident; nevertheless, the curious shops, the markets of
                    different trades (the shops of each trade being generally congregated in one
                    street or district), the easy merchant sitting before his shop, the musical and
                    quaint street-cries of the picturesque venders of fruit, sherbet, water, Ac.,
                    with the ever-changing and many-coloured throng of passengers, all render the
                    streets of Cairo a delightful study for the lover of Arab life, nowhere else to
                    be seen in such perfection, or with so fine a background of magnificent
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>Among the luxurious habits of the Egyptians must be classed the immoderate use of
                    tobacco (as before mentioned) and coffee. They are, however, rarely guilty of
                    the vice of drunkenness, wine being prohibited by the Korân. Eaters of opium,
                    and smokers of hemp, called hasheesh, are not uncommon, though they are always
                    of the dregs of the people. The bath is a favourite resort of both sexes and all
                    classes. In Cairo alone are upwards of sixty public baths, and every good house
                    has a private bath. Their amusements are generally not of a violent kind, being
                    rather in keeping with the sedentary habits of the people, and the heat of the
                    climate. They are acquainted with chess, draughts, backgammon, and other games,
                    among which is one peculiar to themselves, called Mankalah, and played with
                    cowries. The game of the gereed requires great bodily exertion; aud wrestlers,
                    Ac., are found in the country, though not in any number. Music is the most
                    favourite recreation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n750/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0750-0727"/> of the people of Egypt; the songs of the boatmen,
                    the religious chants, and the cries in the streets are all musical. There are
                    male and female musical performers; the former are both instrumental and vocal,
                    the latter (called <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Almeh, pl. ’Awâlim) generally
                    vocal. The ’Awâlim are, as their name (“learned”) implies, generally
                    accomplished women, and should not be confounded with the Ghawâzee, or
                    dancing-girls. There are many kinds of musical instruments. The music, vocal and
                    instrumental, is generally of little compass, and in the minor key; it is
                    therefore plaintive, and strikes a European ear as somewhat monotonous, though
                    often possessing a simple beauty, and the charm of antiquity, for there is
                    little doubt that favourite airs have been handed down from remote ages. The
                    prophet Mohammad condemned music, and its professors are in consequence lightly
                    esteemed by the generality of Muslims, who nevertheless scruple not to enjoy
                    their performances, and resort to the coffee-shops and to private festivities,
                    where they are almost always to be found.</p>
                <p>The Ghawâzee (sing. Ghâzeeyeh) form a separate class, very similar to the
                    gypsies. They always intermarry among themselves only, and are all brought up to
                    the venal profession. Their performances are too well known to need a
                    description here, but it should be observed that the religious and learned
                    Egyptians hold them to be improper. They dance in public, at fairs and religious
                    festivals, and at private festivities, but not iu respectable houses, whether
                    before the men or the ladies. Mehemet Ali banished them to Isne, in Upper Egypt;
                    and the few that remained, occasionally dancing in Cairo, called themselves
                    ’Awâlim, to avoid punishment. A most objectionable class of male dancers also
                    exists, who imitate the dances of the Ghawâzee, and dress iu a kind of
                    nondescript female attire. Not the least curious of the public performances are
                    those of the serpent-charmers, who are generally Rifâ’ee, or Saadee dervishes.
                    Their power over serpents has been doubted by most European travellers, yet
                    their performances remain unexplained; and apparently they possess means of
                    ascertaining the haunts of these and other reptiles, aud of alluring them forth;
                    they, however, always extract the fangs of venomous serpents. Jugglers,
                    rope-dancers, and farce-players must also be mentioned. In the principal
                    coffee-shops of Cairo are to be found reciters of romances, surrounded by
                    interested audiences. They are of three classes, and recite from several works,
                    among which was formerly included the <hi rend="italic">Thousand and One
                    Nights;</hi> but manuscripts of the latter have become so rare as to render it
                    almost impossible to obtain a copy.</p>
                <p>The periodical public festivals are exceedingly interesting, and many of the
                    remarkable observances with which they abound are passing away. The first ten
                    days of the Mohammadan year are held to be blessed, and especially the tenth;
                    and many curious and superstitious practices are observed on these days,
                    particularly by the women. The tenth day, being the anniversary of the martrydom
                    of El-Hoseyn, the mosque of the Hasaneyn is thronged to excess, mostly by women.
                    Following the order of the lunar year, the next festival is that of the Return
                    of the Pilgrims, which is the occasion of great rejoicing, many having friends
                    or relatives in the caravan. The Mahmal, a kind of covered litter, first
                    originated by the celebrated queen Sheger-ed-Durr, is brought into the city in
                    procession, though not with as much pomp as when it leaves with the pilgrims.
                    These and other processions have lost much of their effect since ' the
                    extinction of the Memlooks, and the gradual disuse of gorgeous dress for the
                    retainers of the officers of state. A regiment of regular infantry makes but a
                    sorry substitute for the splendid cavalcade &lt; f former times. The Birth of
                    the Prophet (Moolid en-Nebee), which is celebrated in the beginning of the third
                    month, is the greatest festival of the whole year. During nine days and nights
                    its religious ceremonies are observed at Cairo, in the open space called the
                    Ezbekeeyeh. Next in time, and also in importance, is the Moolid El-Hasaneyn,
                    commemorative of the birth of El-Hoseyn, and lasting fifteen days and nights;
                    and at the same time is kept the Moolid of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob, the last king but
                    one of the Eiyoobee dynasty. In the seventh month occur the Moolid of the
                    seyyideh Zeyneb, and the commemoration of the Mearâg, or the Prophet’s
                    miraculous journey to heaven. Early in the tenth month (Shaabân), the Moolid of
                    the imâm Esh-Shâfe’ee is observed; and the night of the middle of that month has
                    its peculiar customs, being held by the Muslims to be that on which the fate of
                    all living is decided for the ensuing year. Then follows Ramadân, the month of
                    abstinence, a severe trial to the faithful; and the Lesser Festival (El-’Eed
                    es-Sagheer), which commences Showwâl, is hailed by them with delight. A few days
                    after, the Kisweh, or new covering for the Kaabeh at Meecca, is taken in
                    procession from the citadel, where it is always manufactured, to the mosque of
                    the Hasaneyn to be completed; and, later, the caravan of pilgrims departs, when
                    the grand procession of the Mahmal takes place. On the tenth day of the last
                    month of the year, the Great Festival (El-’Eed el-Kebeer), or that of the
                    Sacrifice, closes the calendar.</p>
                <p>The rise of the Nile is naturally the occasion of annual customs, some of which
                    are doubtless relics of antiquity; these are observed according to the Coptic
                    year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be
                    mentioned here that the period of the hot winds, called the Khamâseen, that
                    is,“The Fifties,’’ is calculated from the day after the Coptic Easter, and
                    terminates on the day of Pentecost, and that the Muslims observe the Wednesday
                    preceding this period, called “Job’s Wednesday,” as well as its first day, when
                    many go into the country from Cairo, “to smell the air.” This day is hence
                    called Shemm en-Neseem, or “the smelling of the zephyr.” The ’Ulema observe the
                    same custom on the first three days of the spring quarter.</p></note> The
                    commencement of the rise is fixed to the night of the 11th of Ba-ooneh (Payni),
                    the 17th of June, and is called that of the Drop (Leylet en-Nuktah), because a
                    miraculous drop is then supposed to fall, and cause the swelling of the river.
                    The real rise commences at Cairo about the summer solstice, or a few days later;
                    and on about the 3d of July a crier in each district of the city begins to go
                    his daily rounds, announcing, in a quaint chant, the increase of water in the
                    Nilometer of the island of Er-R&lt;5dah. When the river has risen 20 or 21 feet,
                    he proclaims the Wefà en-Neel, “Completion” or “Abundance of the Nile.” On the
                    following day, the dam which closes the canal of Cairo is cut with much
                    ceremony, and this is the signal for letting the inundation over the surface of
                    the country. A pillar of earth before the dam is called the “Bride of the Nile,”
                    and Arab historians relate that this was substituted, at the Muslim conquest,
                    for a virgin whom it was the custom annually to sacrifice, to ensure a plentiful
                    inundation. A large boat, gaily decked out, representing that in which the
                    victim used to be conveyed, is anchored near, and a gun on board is fired every
                    quarter of an hour during the night. Rockets and other fireworks are also let
                    off, but the best, strangely, after daybreak. The governor of Cairo attends the
                    ceremony of cutting the dam, with the kâdee aud others. The crier continues his
                    daily rounds, with his former chant, excepting on the Coptic New-Year's Day,
                    when the cry of the Wefà is repeated, until the Saleeb, or Discovery of the
                    Cross, the 26th or 27th of September, at which period, the river having attained
                    its greatest height, he concludes his annual employment with another chant, and
                    presents to each house some limes and other fruit, and dry lumps of Nile
                    mud.</p>

                <p>This brief account of the modern Egyptians would be incomplete without a few
                    words concerning the rites attendant on death. The corpse is immediately turned
                    towards Mecca, and the females of the household, assisted by hired mourners,
                    commence their peculiar wailing, while fikees recite portions of the Koran. The
                    funeral takes place on the day of the death, if that happen in the morning;
                    otherwise on the next day. The corpse, having been washed and shrouded, is
                    placed in an open bier, covered with a cashmere shawl, in the case of a man; or
                    in a closed bier, having a post in front, on which are placed female ornaments,
                    in that of a woman or child. The funeral procession is headed by men called
                    “Yemeneeyeh,” chanting the profession of the faith, followed by male friends of
                    the deceased, and a party of schoolboys, also chanting, generally from a poem
                    descriptive of the latter state. Then follows the bier, borne on the shoulders
                    of friends, who are relieved by the passers-by, such an act being deemed highly
                    meritorious. On the way to the cemetery the corpse is generally, in Cairo, in
                    the case of the northern quarters of the city, carried either to the Hasaneyn,
                    or, if the deceased be one of the ’Ulemà, to the Azhar; or, in the case of the
                    southern quarters, to the seyyideh Zeyneb, or some other revered mosque. Here
                    the funeral service is performed by the imâm, or minister of the mosque, and the
                    procession then proceeds to the tomb. In the burials of the rich, water and
                    bread are distributed to the poor at the grave; and sometimes a buffalo or
                    several buffaloes are slaughtered there, and the flesh given away. The tomb is
                    always a vault, surmounted by an oblong stone monument, with a stele at the head
                    and feet; and a cupola, supported by four walls, covers the whole in the case of
                    sheykhs’ tombs and those of the wealthy. During the night following the
                    interment, called the Night of Desolation, or that of Solitude, the soul being
                    believed to remain with the body that one night, fikees are engaged at the house
                    of the deceased to recite various portions of the Korân, and, commonly, to
                    repeat the first clause of the profession of the faith, “There is no deity but
                    God,” three thousand times. The women alone put on mourning attire, by dyeing
                    their veils, shirts, &lt;fcc., dark blue, with indigo; and they stain their
                    hands, and smear the walls, with the same colour. Everything in the house is
                    also turned upside down. The latter customs are not, however, observed on the
                    death of an old man. At certain periods after the burial, a khatmeh, or
                    recitation of the whole of the Korân, is performed, and the tomb is visited by
                    the female relations and friends of the deceased. The women of the fellâheen (or
                    peasants) of Upper Egypt observe some strange dances, &amp;c., at funerals, w
                    hich must be regarded as partly relics of ancient Egyptian customs.</p>

                <p>The native Christians of Egypt, or Copts, are chiefly descended from the ancient
                    Egyptian race; and, as they rarely marry with other races, they preserve in
                    their countenances a great resemblance to the representations of the tombs and
                    temples. Their dress and customs are very similar to those of the Muslim
                    Egyptians, but their reserve towards persons of another persuasion renders a
                    knowledge of their peculiar observances exceedingly difficult. The causes which
                    produced the separation of their church, and the persecutions they suffered,
                    will be noticed in the historical portion of this article. Under Mehemet Ali
                    they were relieved of mi ch oppression, and the immunities then granted to them
                    they still enjoy. The neglected appearance of their houses, and their want of
                    personal cleanliness, are in strong contrast to the opposite habits of the
                    Muslims, and European residents generally prefer the latter as domestic
                    servants.</p>
                <p>The Jews, of whom there have always been great numbers in Egypt, appear to be
                    even more degraded there than in other countries. They are held in the utmost
                    abhorrence by the dominant race, and often are treated with much cruelty and
                    oppression. Many are bankers and moneychangers, &lt;tc. The quarter of the Jews
                    in Cairo is exceedingly filthy, and would give a stranger the notion that they
                    labour under great poverty. But such is not the case; the fear of the Muslims
                    induces them to adopt this outward show of misery, while the interiors of many
                    of their houses are very handsome and luxurious. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. s.

                <p>Before giving a sketch of the history of Egypt it is necessary to speak of
                    Egyptian chronology. The difficulty of this subject has increased with the new
                    information of the monuments. The statements of ancient writers were easily
                    reconciled with half knowledge, but better information shows discrepancies which
                    are in most instances beyond all present hope of solution. It may be said that
                    we know something of the outlines of the technical part of Egyptian chronology;
                    but its historical part is in a great measure mere conjecture before the times
                    when we can check the Egyptian lists by their synchronisms with Hebrew and
                    Assyrian history.</p>
                <p>Dr Brugsch, in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    d'Égypte,</hi> frankly admits the growing difficulty of Egyptian chronology in
                    terms which account for his not having continued his <hi rend="italic">Matériaux

                    of the work made a great change in his theories. Professor Lepsius alone has
                    maintained his views, as stated in the <hi rend="italic">Chronologie</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Konigsbuch,</hi> of which the general correctness has not been
                    disproved, although in any new work it would be necessary greatly to modify the
                    details. The words, already referred to, of Dr Brugsch, which close the
                    introduction to his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> (2d ed.), may be cited in
                    justification of the differences between the present article and that of the
                    last edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia.</hi> “En comparant cette

                    abstenu de fournir des hypothèses auxquelles seulement le temps et des
                    découvertes futures pourront substituer les faits” (p. 3).</p>
                <p>The Egyptians divided the civil day into 24 hours, 12 of the natural day and 12
                    of the night, counted from 1 to 12 during each period. Ordinarily the civil day
                    began during the night, which was indifferently reckoned as belonging to the
                    preceding or following day. Probably the beginning was at midnight. In the
                    astronomical tables of the Tombs of the Kings the civil day probably begins with
                    the night, and the reckoning is from the first hour, or six hours before
                    midnight. The indication is, however, not conclusive, as the tables are of
                    nights only, but one term used makes it highly probable (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Matériaux,</hi> 103). We also find the so. called heliacal rising
                    of Sothis indicated as marking the beginning of the New Year, but this may
                    merely denote that the phenomenon characterized New Year’s day of the original
                    Egyptian year, or of the fixed year, not that tire civil day began with the 11th
                    hour of night (c∕. Id., 99 <hi rend="italic">seqg.;</hi> Ideler, <hi
                    rend="italic">Handbuch der Chronologie,</hi> i. 100-102).</p>
                <p>The Egyptian month was of thirty days. The months are usually known by Greek
                    names occurring in Greek documents, which were taken from the cultus connected
                    with the months, and are thus the Egyptian sacred names. They are 1. Thoth, 2.
                    Phaophi, 3. Athyr, 4. Choiak, 5. Tybi, 6. Mechir, 7. Phamenoth, 8. Pharmuthi, 9.
                    Pachon, 10. Payni, 11. Epiphi, 12. Mesori, after which came the five Epagomenae.
                    The names λvere applied to the Vague and Alexandrian years. The ancient
                    Egyptians had a different system · of names. With them the months were allotted
                    to three great seasons of four months each, of which the months were called 1st,
                    2nd, 3rd, and 4th. These seasons are called “sha,” inundation, “per,” winter,
                    and “sheiua’ summer. The second and third <pb break="no"

                    that of Dr Bmgsch, is not certain. If, however, it was so, we should have a
                    difficulty in deciding to exactly which four months each season applied. It may
                    be remarked that, according to the Copts, there are four months from the
                    supposed beginning of the rise of the Nile, a few days before the summer
                    solstice, to the end of the inundation. If this were the ancient reckoning, and
                    the rendering “inundation” be correct, “winter” would be the cold season, and
                    “summer” would correspond to spring and early summer. In support of this
                    hypothesis it may bo observed that the so-called heliacal rising ot Sothis on
                    the 20th of July marked the beginning of the Egyptian year, although in the year
                    commonly in use this phenomenon passed through all the seasons, and further that
                    in the earliest times of Egyptian history this phenomenon occurred about the
                    time of the summer solstice, and the conventional beginning of the rise of the
                    Nile, the three phenomena probably marking the beginning of the first season

                <p>The common year of the ancient Egyptians is that which has been called the Vague
                    Year, because on account of its length of 365 days it fell short of a tropical
                    or a sidereal year, and thus passed through all the seasons. That this year was
                    that in which the inscriptions are usually dated before the introduction of the
                    Alexandrian year under Augustus appears from the Decree of Canopus (Hierog. 1.
                    18, Greek 1. 36, 37).</p>
                <p>The Egyptians also used a fixed year dated from the so-called heliacal rising of
                    Sothis, July 20. It contained 365 days, and was adjusted by the addition of
                    another day for every four years. It is uncertain how far back this year was in
                    use. The Calendar of Medeenet IIaboo, of the time of Ramses III., begins with
                    the rising of Sothis, or, if wc accept Dr Brugsch’s explanation, withits
                    festival (Jfα⅛rtαt∞, p. 84). Perhaps at the time of this monument the phenomenon
                    fell on the 1st Thoth of the vague year, or within the month; or if. the
                    festival be intended, it may be used as a conventional indication of New Year’s

                    the Alexandrian and Sothiac calendars, but the common Egyptian notation of the
                    months does not appear to have been usually applied to the Sothiac year. An
                    exception is noticed by Dr Brugsch <hi rend="italic">{Ibid.</hi> p. 93), and
                    another instance in which the month-name Tybi appears to be used for the Sothiac
                    calendar, while an Alexandrian name is employed for the corresponding month of
                    the Alexandrian calendar <hi rend="italic">{Ibid.</hi> p. 92, 17. See on the

                <p>The inconvenience of the vague year in relation to the festivals, on account of
                    their connection with natural phenomena, led Ptolemy 111. Euergetes to reform
                    the calendar by intercalating a day after every fourth year before the year next
                    following (Decree oi Canopus, Hierog. 1. 22, Greek 1. 43-45). Obviously this
                    arrest of the common year was more convenient than the change to a fixed year
                    already in use beginning at a different season. This new style was abandoned and
                    the old resumed, but how soon we do not know.</p>
                <p>Under Augustus a fixed year, called the Alexandrian, beginning on the 29-30th
                    August of the Julian year, superseded the vague year. According to Lepsius, the
                    Era of Augustus at Alexandria dated <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 30, but the
                    first year of the new calendar, prolepti-cally, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    26, when the 1st Thoth vague corresponded to 30th August of the proleptic year
                    of Augustus. The new reckoning, however, in his opinion could not have been
                    introduced before <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 8, and was probably introduced
                    A.n. 5. (See Lepsius, <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic">einige
                    Berührungspunkte der</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegyptischcn,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Akad., 1859). Although it is quite possible that Augustus adopted a proleptic
                    synchronism of the Egyptian and Roman years for the official Egyptian year, thus
                    dating back his reform, yet it is more probable that there was some sj&gt;ecial
                    reason for choosing the particular Egyptian year selected, which, moreover, was
                    not the first of the Era of Augustus. Brugsch has put forward a theory, which is
                    the more remarkable in its bearing on this question as it is of wholly
                    independent origin. He has shown reasons for supposing that a year beginning on
                    the 25-29th August was in use in Egypt from the time of Dynasty VI. It must be
                    admitted that many of his correspondences are of the Roman period, and therefore
                    probably refer to the Alexandrian year; but others cannot be so explained, and
                    it seems probable that the year which under Augustus superseded the vague year
                    was already in use long before <hi rend="italic">{Matériaux,</hi> p. 17 <hi
                    rend="italic">scq.).</hi> The Alexandrian year superseded the vague year, and
                    has remained in use to our times, never having been wholly supplanted by the
                    lunar year of the Arabs; but it has now given way to the Gregorian calendar.</p>
                <p>At the time of Dynasty XII. the Egyptians used four years. These Dr Brugsch holds
                    to be the vague year, a solar year, a lunar year, and a lunar year with an
                    intercalation <hi rend="italic">{Hist.,</hi> 2nd ed. 98-99). The second of these
                    years no doubt was the Sothiac, the beginning of which had an original
                    connection with the summer solstice, and the duration of which was probably the
                    Egyptian measure of a solar year. The lunar years would seem to be true lunar
                    years, if we are to accept Μ. Gensler’s theory that the Egyp tians had
                    discovered a method of adjusting their solar calendar with a lunar year by the
                    intercalation of a month eleven times in thirty years <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Id.</hi> 73). That the Egyptians at a later time used four years is evident
                    from the Calendar of Isnè, in which three beginnings are mentioned, that which
                    stands at the head of the document and is of the Sothiac year, a beginning of
                    the “year of the ancients” on the 9th of Thotlι, and another New Year’s day on
                    the 26th of Payni (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Matériaux,</hi> 19-22). This
                    calendar is attributed by Lepsius to the reign of Claudius, but Brugsch can only
                    decide that it is of the Roman period <hi rend="italic">{Id.</hi> 88, <hi
                    rend="italic">cf.</hi> 22). If it is much later than the time fixed by Lepsius,
                    the second commencement may be of the vague year, which began July 28 in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 101-104. It is not probable that it is earlier than
                    the introduction of the Alexandrian year, which, however, is unnoticed. Thus at
                    least four years were probably in use in Egypt under the Romans.</p>
                <p>No Era has been found in the Egyptian inscriptions. They always, if they date at
                    all, date by the year of the reigning sovereign. There is but one instance of a
                    reckoning of the nature of an era. It is the statement of the interval between
                    two distant reigns in the stele in which, under Ramses 11., an interval of four
                    hundred years after a Shepherd king is mentioned, or more strictly, following
                    the analogy of ordinary dates, the 400th year of the earlier king, as though he
                    were still living. This, however, is not a strictly Egyptian document <hi
                    rend="italic">{Records of the Past,</hi> iv. 36). Similarly the coins of the
                    Ptolemies, except one class, present no era; even those bearing the name of
                    Ptolemy Soter, struck in Palestine and Phoenicia under Ptolemy Philadelphus and
                    Ptolemy Euergetes, are dated by the regnal years of the kings who struck them.
                    Theιe are indeed coins dated by an era, probably struck at some town of
                    Phoenicia, but these follow a foreign usage which otherwise is not found in the
                    foreign coinage of the Ptolemies. It is therefore not surprising that the
                    Egyptian cycles mentioned by ancient writers are not traceable on the monuments.
                    One of these, the Sothiac Cycle, consisting of 1460 Sothiac and 1461 vague
                    years, or the period in which the vague year passed through one Sothiac year,
                    was probably used by the astronomers, but we have no indication of its having
                    been known earlier than the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when
                    Geminus writes that the Egyptian festivals pass through the whole year in 1460
                    years <hi rend="italic">{Isag.,</hi> c. 6, Petav., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Uranologium,</hi> 33). Censorinus fixes the beginning of a Sothiac cycle in
                    A.D. 139 (c. 21), in the third vague year or second Alexandrian of the reign of
                    Antoninus Pius. Curiously the Alexandrian coin commemorating in a symbolic
                    manner this event is of the sixth year of this emperor. Theon, writing during
                    the cycle beginning <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 139, speaks of the previous
                    period as the Era of Menoplirês <hi rend="italic">{ap.</hi> Biot, <hi

                    It is therefore generally supposed that a cycle beginning <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 1322 commenced in the reign of a Menptah, usually identified with the
                    king of that name of Dynasty XIX. This is possible but not certain. Other cycles
                    rest on less distinct evidence, and for the present we must be content to accept
                    Brugsch’s cautious judgment on the whole subject.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The historical chronology of ancient Egypt if less obscure than the technical is
                    even fuller of difficulty. Our chief authorities are— (1) the Egyptian historian
                    Manetho, who gave a list of thirty dynasties, and the length of each, with in
                    some cases the duration of the individual reigns, (2) the similar list of the
                    Turin Papyrus of Kings, and (3) various data of the monuments. Manetho’s list is
                    unhappily in a veιy cormpt condition. It appears, however, that his method is
                    generally not strictly chronological. As far as we know, he makes up the sum of
                    each dynasty, except Dynasty XI I., of the individual reigns, where these are
                    stated, taking no account of the overlapping of some of them. He seems to have
                    given larger sums in three great groups. These again are made up of the sums of
                    dynasties, and if any were in part or wholly contemporary, they are treated as
                    successive. According to Syncellus, he stated the duration of the dynasties tobe
                    3555 years. If this number, which suspiciously enough is given apart from the
                    dynastic list, came down correctly to the Byzantine chronographer, many hundred
                    years must be cut off' from the totals of the dynasties as they now stand for
                    contemporary dynasties or kings. The Turin Papyrus is unfortunately in a far
                    worse state than Manetho’s list, but it is valuable as confirming and correcting
                    it. The system of reckoning seems, however, to have been more strictly
                    chronological than Manetho’s usual method. The various data of⅛he monuments are
                    as yet of little value beyond affording evidence that Manetho’s numbers <pb

                    historical chronology which may ultimately be united into a complete system. It
                    has indeed been supposed that they enable us to construct an approximative
                    chronology on genealogical evidence. This system, however, breaks down where we
                    can test it, and it is therefore dangerous where it must stand alone. The great
                    genealogy of the official architects gives 21 generations from the contemporary
                    of Setee I. (Dynasty XIX. 2), to the contemporary of Darius I. (XXVII. 3); and
                    thus, allowing three generations to a century, we should bring the birth of
                    Setee and the beginning of Dynasty XIX. to about <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>

                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> It is, however, quite certain that, reckoning from
                    the synchronism of Sheshonk I., or Shishak, with Relιoboam, we must allow for
                    the intervening period at least a century more. The historical events require
                    this. We must therefore suppose that generations, either of heiresses or of
                    other persons who did not hold the office of architect, are dropped. If this
                    method of computing by genealogies thus fails where we have a genealogical list,
                    obviously it cannot be applied to dynastic lists which we do not know to be
                    genealogical. The average length of reigns is usually different from and less
                    than that of generations, and we cannot tell the most probable average length of
                    reigns without knowing’ the law of succession of the country, and its political
                    conditions in the period under consideration. It is therefore especially
                    hazardous thus to measure the Egyptian chronology before. Dynasty XVIII., at

                    however, be incomplete without a short account of the chronological views of the
                    leading Egyptologists. Μ. Mariette accepts Manetho’s numbers with some

                <p>There are two weak points in all these systems. They rest to a greater or less
                    degree upon numbers either occurring but once or due to a single authority. The
                    sum of 3555 years, which is the foundation of Professor Lepsius’s system, occurs
                    in but a single passage, and the same is the case with the round number of 500
                    years adopted by Dr Brugsch for the doubtful period of Dynasties XIII.-XVII.; it
                    is taken from Manetho’s 511 years of the Shepherd dominion. How if both these
                    numbers are corrupt? If they are not their er ∙ape is a marvel, considering to
                    what authors and copyists we owe them. Again, the sums of most individual
                    dynasties rest on Manetho’s sole authority, and his lists are in a state which
                    is at present hopeless. It is equally unfortunate that while certain dynasties
                    are represented by monuments from which Manetho’s lists can be verified, others
                    have left little or no records. Thus we have no monuments of Dynasties I.-III.
                    until the close of the last. Then there is an abundance of monuments of
                    Dynasties IV., V., VI. A blank follows without a monument that we can assign to
                    Dynasties VII., VIII., IX., X. Records reappear under Dynasty XL; of Dynasty
                    XII. they are abundant. Under Dynasty XIII. they become scanty, and of X1V.,
                    XV., XVI., XVII. there are but a few, which may be of XV., XVI., or XVII. We
                    have therefore three blank periods, the age before known monuments, the interval
                    of Dynasties VII.-X., and that of Dynasties XIII.-XVII. It is significant that
                    whereas Μ. Mariette’s reckoning exceeds that of Professor Lepsius 1112 years in
                    the whole sum of the thirty dynasties, the excess is no less than 966 years in
                    the sums of Dynasties VIL-X. and XIII.-XVII. Such a difference between two such
                    great authorities is a proof of the want of even probability for solving this
                    part of the problem. Dr Brugsch, in applying the genealogical method to the
                    lists of the monuments for the first and second blanks, while he rejects it for
                    the third, is manifestly unwary. The evidence of the Turin Papyrus proves that
                    we must not apply any such method to the third blank. How do we know that it can
                    be applied to the other two? It may be argued that Manetho’s numbers for the
                    reigns of the first blank are probable, but neither his lists nor the monuments
                    throw any light on those of the second, to which, notwithstanding, Dr Brugsch
                    allows no less a period than about 500 years. His system has also the special
                    fault that it rests on the supposition that the Egyptian reigns are equivalent
                    to generations, which, as already shewn, is by no means proved.</p>
                <p>In the following sketch of Egyptian history no dates before the Christian Era
                    will be given until the beginning of Dynasty XVIII., when approximative
                    chronology becomes possible. Where, however, we may reasonably conjecture the
                    length of a particular part cf history, this will be stated.</p>
                <p>The traditional age in Egypt is extremely obscure. History begins with the First
                    Dynasty. The earlier period with Manetho, who is supported by the Turin Papyrus,
                    is mythological, the age of the divine reigns, an idea also traceable in the
                    monuments which treat certain divinities as sovereigns. This age is held to be
                    spoken of on the monuments as that of the Shesu-har, the servants, followers, or
                    successors, of Horus, who, in mythology, aid him in his combats with Seth
                    (Chabas, <hi rend="italic">Ant. Hist.,</hi> 7, 8; Brugsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.,</hi> 2d ed. 23). Manetho completely divests the time of any historical
                    character by making it cyclical. It might be supposed that the Egyptians had
                    some idea of records actually dating from this age, if we could accept Μ.
                    Chabas’s reading of the Ptolemaic inscription relating to the plan of the temple
                    of Dendarah, in which it is stated that the original plan was found in the time
                    of Peρi, of Dynasty VL, in ancient characters on a skin of ιhe time of the
                    Shesu-har. It appears, however, from the context that this inscription was of
                    the time oi Khufu, of Dynasty Iλ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>., and
                    consequently the parallel expression is merely used to denote remote antiquity
                    (Dümichen, <hi rend="italic">Bauurkunde der Tempelanlagen</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Egyptian mythology has not been found to contain any allusion to a deluge, nor to
                    have any connection with the Mosaic narrative in reference to the cosmogony and
                    the early conditions of the human race. Similar terms have been pointed out, but
                    the leading facts are wanting. Thus the Egyptian ideas of their prehistoric age
                    have a strange isolation by the side of those of most other nations of remote
                    civilization, which agree in one or more particulars with the narrative of
                    Genesis. Discoveries may, however, modify this view.</p>

                <p>In Egypt stone implements have been recently discovered. Owing, however, to the
                    abundance of historical monuments, the prehistorical remains have scarcely
                    received due attention. We do not yet know whether these implements were used by
                    the Egyptians or by savage tribes who may have made incursions into their
                    territory. We find, however, the use of flint arrow-heads in the historical
                    period from the paintings at Benee-Hasan (Dynasty XII.).</p>
                <p>It is impossible to conjecture the duration of the prehistoric age in Egypt. M.
                    Chabas has proposed a space of 4000 years before the First Dynasty as sufficient
                    for the development of the civilization which had already attained maturity in
                    the time of the Fourth Dynasty <hi rend="italic">(Änc</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.,</hi> 9, 10). We are, however, so entirely ignorant of the causes of this
                    civilization, and so unable to decide how far it was native to the soil of
                    Egypt, that it is safer to abstain from any attempt to compute a period of the
                    length of which the historical Egyptians themselves do not appear to have had
                    any idea.</p>
                <p>With Menes, in Egyptian Mena, the “stable,” the history of Egypt begins. It is
                    true that Manetho states cautiously of his successors of the Second Dynasty
                    certain things that are evidently legendary. This must be the natural result of
                    a want of monumental evidence, and a consequent dependence on tradition. At
                    present no monuments are known before the time of the last king of Dynasty III.,
                    and this may be the limit at which inscribed contemporary records began. It is,
                    however, agreed by all Egyptologists that the founder of the Egyptian state is
                    no legendary personage. All we know of him wears the air of history, and is
                    consistent with the conditions in which a state would have been formed. Menes
                    was of Thinis, in Upper Egypt, and consequently the first two dynasties are
                    called Thinite. Thinis, or This, in Egyptian Teni, was perhaps only a quarter of
                    the more famous Abydos. Certainly it was obscured by the near neighbourhood of
                    the sacred city. Menes, having gained the sovereignty of Egypt, which probably
                    before his time was divided into two states, founded the city of Memphis. In
                    order to gain sufficient room for the site he changed the course of the Nile by
                    constructing a dike, which turned the stream more to the east. M. Linant
                    believes that this dyke is probably represented by that of Kusheysh. 'Γhe great
                    temple of Ptah, at Memphis, was then founded; and there can be no doubt that the
                    seat of government was, under Meπes, or not much later, removed to the new city.
                    Menes made laws and waged a successful war. After a long reign of sixty-two
                    years he was killed by a hippopotamus. All this has a perfectly historical
                    aspect. Only a legislator and warrior, and so a mighty hunter, could have set
                    upon a stable basis the long-lasting fabric of Egyptian polity. The main
                    qualities of the man who did this could not have been forgotten at Memphis,
                    which was great and flourishing, the chief seat of Egyptian learning and wealth,
                    before the close of the Third Dynasty. The reproach that Menes corrupted the
                    primitive simplicity of the Egyptians is probably a perverted tradition, like
                    that which changed the tyranny of Khufu and Khafra to impiety. In later times
                    Menes was reverenced with other kings, but as far as we know had no special
                    worship, a condition suitable to his historical character, now universally
                    admitted.</p>
                <p>Athothis, either Tota or Atot, the first or second successor of Menes, is related
                    to have founded the palace at Memphis, and, being a physician, to have written
                    anatomical books. A medical papyrus in the Museum of Berlin, composed under
                    Ramses II. (Dynasty XIX.), curiously illustrates the second statement. It
                    contains a portion said to have been copied from a very ancient papyrus
                    discovered in the time of Hesp-ti, or Usaphaidos, a later king of the First
                    Dynasty, and to have been subsequently taken to Senta, or Sethenes, of the next
                    line (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2 ed., 42). Under Uenephes, the
                    fourth Thinite king, a great famine, the first recorded, ravaged Egypt, He is
                    also said to have raised the pyramids near Kochome. As Kakem is the monumental
                    name of the part of the Memphite necropolis around the Serapeum, and north of
                    the Pyramid of Steps of Sakkarah, Dr Brugsch and others are disposed to consider
                    that pyramid, which is a very archaic structure among pyramids, to be here
                    intended. The use of the plural “pyramids” by Manetho does not stand in the way
                    of the identification, as we know a case in which a small pyramid was built at
                    the same time as a large one. We do not know the original purpose of the
                    monument. Under the early dynasties it was used as the burial-place of the bulls
                    Apis. As, however, their worship was introduced under Dynasty IL, it may have
                    been at first a royal sepulchre, like all other pyramids of which we know the
                    use. Under Semempses, the seventh king of the dynasty, Manetho speaks of many
                    wonders and a very great plague. Thus the two chief scourges of Egypt appear in
                    this remote age, suggesting a large population, and consequently the length of
                    the period preceding the accession of Menes.</p>
                <p>With Boethos, or Butau, the Second Dynasty begins. Manetho relates that in his
                    time a great chasm opened at Bubastis and many perished. Frequent as volcanic
                    shocks are in Egypt, it is long since an earthquake has been experienced in that
                    country. There are, however, reasons, from the manner in which monuments have
                    fallen and the records of earthquakes in Palestine in antiquity, for supposing
                    that Egypt was anciently more subject to such calamities than in later times.
                    The next king, Kaiechos, Kakau, introduced the worship of the bulls Apis at
                    Memphis, and Mnevis at Heliopolis, and of the Mendesian goat, and his name
                    appears to commemorate these innovations, probably a necessary step owing to the
                    increase of population, for animals locally worshipped were thus restricted in
                    number. We also notice that already Heliopolis and Mendes, besides Thinis,
                    Memphis, and Bubastis had been founded. Under the next king, whose name,
                    Binothris, Bainnuter, was probably commemorative of the new worship at Mendes,
                    we read that a law was passed that women could hold the sovereign power. This
                    might in a semi-barbarous condition be a relic of polyandry, but in Egypt the
                    civilization of Dynasty IV. forbids such an explanation, and we must rather
                    regard this new law as a proof of advancement. In consequence we find a few
                    reigns of queens in the Egyptian lists, but only one of them, Sebek-neferu-ra
                    (Dynasty XII.), appears in those of the monuments. Succession through an heiress
                    was, however, carefully respected, and it was perhape for want of a son that
                    Binothris made this edict. It may be chance, but Manetho calls each king of
                    Dynasty I. after Menes, son oi his predecessor, whereas under Dynasty II. he
                    drops this characterization. Nothing more is told of this line but two marvels,
                    that under Manetho’s seventh king, Nephercheres, the Nile was fabled to have
                    flowed mixed with honey for eleven days, and that the eighth, Sesochris, was
                    said to have had a height of 5 cubits and 3 palms, which is not improbably a
                    confused account of a colossal statue.</p>
                <p>The royal house now changed by the accession of Dynasty III., the first of
                    Memphites. Manetho relates how, under its head, Necherophes or Necherochis, the
                    Nebka of the monumental lists, the Libyans revolted from the Egyptians but
                    returned to their allegiance terrified by a sudden increase of the moon. It is
                    useless to speculate on the character of the phenomenon which, unless it be
                    legendary, was probably an eclipse; but the glimpse we thus obtain of an
                    Egyptian dominion beyond the Nile valley at this remote age iβ most valuable. In
                    Genesis the Lehabim, or Lubim, appear as a race kindred to the Egyptians. In the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n755/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0755-0732"/> Egyptian inscriptions they are called Rebu, or
                    Lebu, and appear on early monuments as a dark people. Under the Empire they have
                    Caucasian characteristics. The change was probably due to the great maritime
                    migrations of the Pelasgic tribes, in which the Libyans had an important share.
                    To the next king, Tosorthros, Manetho assigns the invention of building with
                    hewn stones and cultivation of letters, and says that for his medical knowledge
                    the Egyptians called him Aesculapius. If the Pyramid of Steps dates from an
                    earlier king, the first statement must be qualified, though it is to be remarked
                    that the difference of constructive skill between that monument, if so early,
                    and the works of Dynasty IV., would almost justify the historian; and again the
                    discovery of inscriptions of a less accurately ordered kind than those of
                    Dynasty IV. may support the second statement; the third seems at variance with
                    the Memphite worship of the Egyptian Aesculapius, Imhwep. On the monuments
                    contemporary history begins with the last king the lists assign to this dynasty,
                    Senoferu, probably Manetho’s last but one, Sephuris. We may now take a
                    retrospect of the age. It is in some respects curiously primitive in comparison
                    with that which immediately follows it. Dr Brugsch has remarked the general
                    absence in the kings’ names of the name of Ra, afterwards essential to
                    thronenames, which from the medallic character of some of these they seem to
                    have been, and the equally general absence of the names of other gods, Ra
                    occurring once in the three dynasties and Sekeri once. Again he has observed the
                    somewhat plebeian aspect of these names, as proper to men who sternly ruled the
                    masses. Mena is “the stable,” he who resists; Tota, “he who strikes;” Senta,
                    “the terrible;” Huni,“he who strikes.” Senoferu is “the betterer.” As “the
                    striker of the peoples,” for so he is called in his inscription at Wadee
                    Maghârah, in the Sinaitic peninsula, he is a foreign conqueror.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The chronological length of
                    this first unknown period in the thirty dynasties cannot be determined. In the
                    Turin Papyrus three durations of reigτls are preserved. They are each less than
                    Manetho’s numbers of the same reigns, however we fit the two lists together. It
                    is further remarkable that while the length of Dynasty I. gives nearly a
                    generation of 33∣ years to each reign (253÷8 = 3Γ6) that of Dynasty II. gives
                    almost exactly this average (302, Afr.÷9 = 33'5; 297, Eus.÷9-33.)</p></note></p>
                <p>From Senoferu, at the close of Dynasty III., to the end of Dynasty VI., we have a
                    succession of contemporary monuments by which history can be reconstructed, not
                    only in its political events, but in those details of the condition of the
                    population which make an essential part of all real history. Under Senoferu we
                    find great material prosperity, and the arts already in that condition of
                    excellence which makes the Pyramid age in some respects the most remarkable in
                    the annals of Egypt. We also find foreign conquest, not as in the time of the
                    Empire for glory, but with the view of extending the Egyptian rule to countries
                    whose products were valuable for the arts. It is thus that this Pharaoh is the
                    earliest who has left a tablet in the Sinaitic peninsula, where perhaps he, as
                    Dr Brugsch thinks, was the first to plant military colonies to protect the
                    workers in the mines of copper and the valuable blue stone called “mafkat,” and
                    this idea is supported by his being afterwards worshipped there. He is also the
                    first king whose pyramid is found with its special name on the monuments. Dr
                    Brugsch thinks it is that now called the Pyramid of Meydoom, near which chapels
                    of tombs bearing his name have been discovered, and a group consisting of two
                    statues, remarkable as a splendid specimen of Egyptian archaic art. The
                    subjects, it may be remarked, were usually buried near the pyramid of the
                    reigning king. Senoferu the betterer left a good name as a beneficent king, and
                    his worship was maintained until the Ptolemaic period.</p>
                <p>Khufu, the Suphis I. of Manetho and Cheops of Hero dotus, immediately succeeds
                    Senoferu in the lists of the monuments, so that he may be regarded as the
                    legitimate head of Dynasty IV. The list of that dynasty is as follows :—Khufu,
                    Ratatf, Khafra, Menkaura, Shepseskaf, corresponding to eight kings in Manetho,
                    in whom also the order is different, Ratatf (Ratoises) following Menkaura
                    (Mencheres), a natural consequence of the association in fame of the builders of
                    the three most celebrated pyramids, Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura.<note

                    Bryn.,</hi> 256 <hi rend="italic">seqq. ),</hi> but in the list of Manetho the
                    intervening reigns (Ratoises 25, Suphis [IL] 66) amount to 91 years. If we allow
                    her to have been 14 years old at the end of the reign of Senoferu and to have
                    lived a year into that of Khafra, her age would not be less than 106 years. This
                    is very near the extreme limit of human life in the Egyptian inscriptions, 110
                    years, and it is based on the minimum of time possible in the case. The length
                    of early kings’ lives in the Turin Papyrus supports this view. Probably the
                    reigns overlapped one another. This idea is supported by the two chief chambers
                    in the Great Pyramid, which has already made Μ. de Rongé suspect that it was the
                    tomb of two kings <hi rend="italic">(Id.</hi> 261, note 1). A sound argument for
                    the chronology of the time miglιt be found in the size of the three chief
                    pyramids. A pyramid was the great work of a king’s reign, and it was so
                    constructed that it might be continually increased in size and yet easily
                    completed at any time. The Great Pyramid would indicate a reign of maximum
                    duration; so, too, the Second; whereas the Third would, in its original size,
                    mark a shorter time. By this method we should be induced to accept Manetho’s
                    numbers for Khufu, 63 years, and Khafra, 66, but to doubt the long reign of
                    Menkaura, 63. It would be reasonable on the other evidence to make Ratatf
                    contemporary with Khufu or Khafra.</p></note></p>
                <p>The age of the pyramid-builders is the most brilliant before the Empire. We can
                    judge from the royal tombs of the magnificence of the kings, and from the
                    sepulchres around of the wealth of the subjects. The construction of the
                    pyramids has perhaps been unduly marvelled at: we should know in what other
                    manner the kings employed the vast amount of manual labour at their disposal, if
                    we would estimate how much they could have effected by it in pyramid-building in
                    the long period of time for which they ruled. If the two reigns of Khufu and
                    Khafra extended over more than a century and a quarter, we may measure what we
                    know them to have done against the works of other states during a like interval,
                    and the comparison reduces our wonder.</p>
                <p>The regal power at this time seems to have been very strong. So at least may we
                    infer from the phraseology of the inscriptions, and from the fact that the kings
                    threw much, if not all, of the force of the nation into personal monuments for
                    their own memorial. Never in later times is the royal tomb the chief object of
                    the king’s reign, or is he so completely detached from the welfare of Egypt. The
                    pyramids with their priesthoods are proofs that then the Pharaoh was more
                    positively worshipped than ever afterwards.</p>
                <p>It must, how ever, be admitted that the great men whose tombs are planned around
                    the pyramids enjoyed abundant wealth and ease. Their time was passed not in war
                    or in state affairs, but in the management of large estates, probably royal
                    gifts, and in superintending the handicrafts of their people, and giving no
                    small share of their leisure to the pleasures of the chase, to hospitality, and
                    to the enjoyment of musical performances. In the chapels of their tombs these
                    occupations of everyday life are portrayed. There is no sign of war, no great
                    military class. It is true that the common folk seem to have been very poor, but
                    their life in that land of abundance is at least represented as happy. On the
                    other hand, it is significant that the nobility include a large number of the
                    royal family, and that the king is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n756/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0756-0733"/> not represented in the tombs, and when he is
                    spoken of it is in terms of the most distant respect. Similarly there is an
                    extraordinary reserve as to worship. Religious subjects are wanting, and the
                    religious inscriptions are usually limited to the formula of dedication. The
                    priesthood is already numerous, but it is connected with the service of the
                    chapels of the pyramids. In the vast court a baneful bureaucratic class is
                    already growing, in future to destroy the welfare of the people.</p>
                <p>The reign of Khufu is principally marked by the building of the Great Pyramid. We
                    learn from a curious inscription of a later date that he rebuilt the temple of
                    Isis, near the Sphinx, carved out of the rock by some earlier king, and that he
                    made a pyramid for the Princess Hent-sen in the same neighbourhood. The charge
                    of impiety which the local tradition reported by Herodotus brings against Khufu
                    thus fails, and the charge of tyranny associated with it, may be equally
                    groundless. The cost of life in building the Great Pyramid can scarcely be
                    compared with that of a long war under conditions resembling those of modern
                    China. It should be noted that Khufu, as well as Khafra and Ratatf, were still
                    objects of worship under Dynasty XXVI. (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi>
                    2d ed. 57, 58). The only record of foreign conquest is a tablet in the peninsula
                    of Sinai, commemorating what was probably no more than a successful maintenance
                    of the posts already there established to guard the mines.</p>
                <p>The reign of Khafra is commemorated, like that of Khufu, by the royal sepulchre
                    and the tombs of subjects. From the latter we are able to contradict the
                    tradition of his hostility to the national religion, in which Herodotus
                    associates him with Khufu. The most interesting remains of the time are the
                    statues of this king found in a well near the Sphinx, into which they were
                    probably thrown either by a foreign invader or by early Christians or by Arabs,
                    rather than in a popular revolt after his death <hi rend="italic">(cf.,</hi>
                    however, Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Histoire Ancienne,</hi> 73). A statue and a
                    bust of Khafra from this find have been published by M. de Rouge <hi
                    rend="italic">(Six Prem. Dyn.,</hi> pl. iv. v.). Both are remarkable works,
                    showing a naturalistic style that makes them far superior to later statues. The
                    king’s head is evidently a portrait, and the type is more Caucasian than the
                    generality of later subjects.</p>
                <p>Menkaura, or Mencheres, the Mycerinus of Herodotus, and the founder of the Third
                    Pyramid, does not seem to have been specially reverenced in later times, in
                    contradiction to the report of Herodotus. It is, however, interesting, in
                    connection with the tradition of his support of religion, that the Egyptian <hi
                    rend="italic">Ritual</hi> speaks of its 64th chapter as found by Har-tot-ef, son
                    of Mencheres, at Hermopolis Magna, when he made an inspection of the temples of
                    Egypt, and brought as a precious document to the king (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2d ed. p. 59, 60). It would thus appear that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ritual</hi> was not then completed, and Manetho’s statement that
                    Suphis I., Khufu, wrote the sacred book may be another hint as to its date. It
                    may also be noticed that the queen of Khafra was priestess of Thoth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Six Prem. Tlyn.,</hi> 277 <hi rend="italic">seqqj),</hi> and a
                    noble, probably son of Khafra, was high-priest of Thoth at Hermopolis, a dignity
                    held by another prince in the same reign <hi rend="italic">(Id.</hi> 280,
                    281).</p>
                <p>The most interesting record of Menkaura is his wooden mummy-case, found by
                    General Howard Vyse in the Third Pyramid. In the disappointing silence of those
                    vast monuments, without a single ancient Egyptian writing save the graffiti of
                    workmen and the inscriptions of native visitors, this solitary record of the
                    time is the one authoritative voice from the royal sepulchres, and it tells us
                    in its short archaic formula that the whole myth of Osiris in its relations to
                    human destiny was already matured. The king as Osiris has become divine and has
                    vanquished his enemies (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2d ed., 58,
                    59).</p>
                <p>The next family, Dynasty V., continued to rule at Memphis.<note anchored="true"

                    ancient moral treatise already noticed in speaking of Egyptian literature, which
                    is on the whole the best fruit of Egyptian thought that time has spared. The
                    last king, Unas, varied the form of royal tombs, by constructing the great
                    truncated pyramid now called Mastabat-Faraoon, or Pharaoh’s Seat, north of the
                    Pyramids of Dahshoor. <hi rend="italic">(Id.</hi> 67.)</p>
                <p>The Sixth Dynasty was probably a family of a different part of Egypt.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Manetho assigns to Dynasty
                    VI. a duration of 203 years. The monumental lists, themselves in disaccord, the
                    Turin Papyrus, and the contemporary inscription of Una, show that Manetho’s list
                    is here hopelessly corrupted. Una was in office under the immediate or second
                    predecessor as well as under the immediate successor of Pepi, usually identified
                    with Plιiops, to whom the Egyptian historian assigns a reign of 100 or possibly
                    94 years. Μ. de Rongé has seen this difficulty, and discussed without finally
                    resolving it <hi rend="italic">(Six Ρτern. Dyn.,</hi> 361 <hi rend="italic"
                    >scqq.).</hi> Μ. Maspero has proposed a most ingenious restoration of the

                    96). This conjecture seems to us to be confirmed by the name of the later
                    Neferkara Pepi of the Tablet of Abydos being qualified by the title “seneb," as
                    if to distinguish him from an earlier king of otherwise identical
                    name</p></note> It has left many records which indicate less centralization at
                    Memphis than those of the earlier sovereigns, and mark the beginning of wars for
                    predatory purposes and extension of territory. This change is accompanied by a
                    less careful style of sculpture, and less pains in the excavation of the tombs,
                    as though the Egyptians were gaining a larger horizon, or, it may be, exchanging
                    religion for ambition. The interest of the dynasty centres in the undoubtedly
                    long reign of Pepi, second or third king of the line, and the inscription of
                    Una. In this inscription we first read of great wars, and foreign conquered
                    nations are spoken of by name. A military system had already begun, for we read
                    how the king sent with Una an officer and soldiers to transport a sarcophagus
                    for the royal tomb from the quarries of Turk. A war is then undertaken against
                    the nomads of the eastern desert— the Amu (Shemites <hi rend="italic">ΐ)</hi>
                    and the Herusha, “those who are on the sand.” An army is levied from the whole
                    population of Upper and Lower Egypt, as though there were no military caste.
                    Negroes are also enrolled from several countries mentioned byname, which must
                    have been subject to Egypt, and are drilled by Egyptian officers, including
                    priests. Una is appointed general in chief. Five separate expeditions are
                    conducted by him into the country of the Herusha. It seems an error to suppose
                    that this nation were Arabs of the desert, for the Egyptian general cut down
                    their vines and their fig-trees (I) Another expedition was conducted by water
                    against the same nation in a country called Takheba? (De Rougé) or Terehba '?
                    (Brugsch), which M. de Rougé conjectures may be Arabia Petraea, or a part of
                    Syria, remarking that it was near Egypt, for the expeditions seem to have been
                    annual. The external activity of the reign of Pepi is also attested by a tablet
                    at Wâdee Ma-gharali, and his public works by many inscriptions, among which we
                    must not omit the occurrence of his name at Tanis, and in the inscription
                    relating to the building of the temple of Dendarah. He founded a city called the
                    “City of Pepi” in Middle Egypt, which has wholly disappeared, and tombs of his
                    time are found in various parts of the Nile valley. His pyramid, which, like
                    Memphis, was called the “good station,” Men-nofer, was probably at the ancient
                    capital, and may be one of the two great pyramids of Dahshoor, which <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n757/mode/1up"

                    judge from their structure, and both of which from their size imply reigns of
                    the greatest prosperity and of long duration.</p>
                <p>Pepi was succeeded by his son Merenra. The new king made Una governor of Upper
                    Egypt, and employed him to bring blocks of granite from Elephantine for his
                    pyramid, and in various other works of which the inscription already referred to
                    gives most curious details. He was charged to obtain wood, which was provided by
                    the prince of four Ethiopian nations already mentioned among those furnishing
                    negroes to the great army of Pepi. We thus learn that tributary Ethiopia was
                    ruled by a native prince or princes under the governor of Upper Egypt, who also
                    had the power of establishing posts in the dependency. Una made four docks and
                    timber-yards in Ethiopia for building boats, and attached a chapel to each. We
                    may thus expect to find some record of Egyptian rule at this early time, long
                    before the complete reduction of Lower Nubia, in territories far south; for the
                    timber-growing country does not begin for some distance within the tropics.</p>
                <p>Merenra was followed by his younger brother Neferkara, and, according to Manetho,
                    the dynasty ended with the beautiful Queen Nitocris, whose name appears in the
                    Turin Papyrus, but whose exact historical place is not certain. If she was
                    buried in the Third Pyramid, of which Manetho, according to the copyists, makes
                    her the builder, she enlarged the original work of Mencheres, and certainly no
                    pyramid is so evidently not merely a double structure but one of double design.
                    Nitocris is almost the only Egyptian whose historical character has been lost in
                    a succession of legends. One version of her story is the most ancient form of
                    that of Cinderella; in another, she still bewitched the Arab of the Middle Ages
                    when he approached her pyramid <hi rend="italic">{cf.</hi> Maspero, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 94).</p>
                <p>With the later part of Dynasty VI. the second great chasm in Egyptian history
                    begins, and we have no monuments to guide us until the time of Dynasty XI.
                    According to Manetho, Dynasties VII. and VIII. were of Memphites, and IX. and X.
                    of Heracleopolites, the Diospolite or Theban line comprising Dynasties XL, XII.,
                    and XIII. Whether the dynasties which intervened between the VIth and XIIth were
                    contemporary or successive, and how much time they occupied, cannot yet be
                    proved. In the Tablet of Abydos, a series of kings unknown from other monuments
                    follows Dynasty VI., and precedes two kings of Dynasty XI. In the Chamber of
                    Kings of El-Karnak other and earlier kings of Dynasty XI. are named, with
                    curious indications that it was first but a local line. To the period of the
                    earlier kings of Dynasty XI. belongs Entef-aa, who reigned at least fifty years.
                    It would appear that the Memphite kingdom waned, and that another line arose at
                    Thebes, the house of the Entefs and Mentuhoteps. The power of these kings
                    gradually increased, and at last one of them reunited under a single rule the
                    whole of Egypt. (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 98, 99.) Probably
                    the Heracleopolite line, Dynasties IX., X., was a local house contemporary with
                    the Memphites or Thebans, or both.</p>

                    circumstances referred to in the “Instructions” of Amenemhat I., its first king,
                    to his son Usurtesen I., we have a glimpse into the unquiet condition of the
                    country when the line arose <hi rend="italic">{Id.,</hi> 101). Similarly the
                    custom of associating the heir apparent as king with his father, the peculiarity
                    of this dynasty, indicates the dangers that then surrounded the throne <hi

                <p>It is to the grottoes of Benee-Hasan that we owe most of our knowledge of the
                    manners and arts of Egypt under Dynasty XII., and much of its history is there
                    told in the memoirs of a family of governors under the first five kings of this
                    house. No one can have examined these beautiful tombs without being struck by
                    the advance in architecture which they show, and the evidence of prosperity and
                    cultivation afforded by their paintings. The subjects resemble those of the
                    tombs of the earlier dynasties, but there is a greater variety, partly due to a
                    more luxurious condition of society, partly to a more flexible art. It is
                    sufficiently evident that the preceding dynasty (XI.) cannot have been weak, and
                    the country under its rule distracted. A time of prosperity must have preceded
                    this bright period of Egyptian history.</p>
                <p>Amenemhat I., probably a successful minister of an earlier king (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2d ed., 79, 80, 84), had an active and prosperous
                    reign, ruling like Pepi beyond Egypt to the south, and occupying himself in the
                    construction of various monuments. As the head of a new line he paid special
                    attention to the boundaries of territories, to the regulation of the inundation,
                    and to the confirmation of hereditary governors (Benee-Hasan inscr.; Brugsch,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2d ed., 94, 95). A very curious view of the state
                    of Egypt in his time is given us by the story of Saneha in a hieratic papyrus of
                    the Berlin Museum (translated by M. Goodwin, in <hi rend="italic">Records of the
                    Past,</hi> vi. 131, <hi rend="italic">seqq.</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> It is
                    the history of an Egyptian who fled from the king and took refuge with a
                    neighbouring prince, whose territory unhappily we cannot as yet determine, and
                    after a long sojourn sought his sovereign’s pardon and returned home to be taken
                    into the favour of Amenemhat. The reception of the fugitive abroad, his
                    home-sickness, and the kindness of the Pharaoh, who at the same time is
                    described in terms of the most abject respect, form an interesting picture, and
                    one remarkably illustrating several events in the history of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Under Usurtesen I., the co-regent and successor of Amenemhat I., Egypt had
                    reached its highest prosperity after the age of the pyramid-builders of Dynasty
                    IV. The obelisk which still marks the site of Heliopolis, a fragment of a statue
                    at Tanis, inscriptions on the rocks of the Sinaitic peninsula, and a stele from
                    Wâdee Halfeh, recording foreign conquests in the south, now in the Naples
                    Museum, attest the splendour of this reign. The records of private individuals
                    are, however, its most instructive memorials. Mentuhotep has given us a picture
                    of the power and status of an Egyptian prime minister, holding all or nearly all
                    the functions of the members of a modern cabinet, a position singularly parallel
                    to that of Joseph, to the detail that even great men bowed before him. To his
                    stele we owe the in - formation that he gained successes against the Asiatics,
                    the Herusha, and the negroes. (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2d ed.,
                    91, <hi rend="italic">seqq.)</hi></p>
                <p>Of Amenemhat II. and Usurtesen IL, the next kings, there is little to relate but
                    that Egypt continued to prosper. It was under Usurtesen III. that a great step
                    in advance was made by the fixing of the boundaries of the Egyptian dominion
                    beyond the Second Cataract, at Semneh and Kummeh, where this king built
                    sanctuaries and fortresses, and placed great boundary-marks in the form of
                    tablets. These in their inscriptions define the limits of the kingdom, and
                    regulate the passage of negroes by the river <hi rend="italic">{Id.,</hi> 102).
                    Here and throughout Nubia, Usurtesen was worshipped in subsequent times. He had
                    introduced a settled government into the country, which long after was virtually
                    a part of Egypt rather than a dependency. His successor Amenemhat III. is
                    chiefly famous for his great engineering works. That care which the first
                    Amenemhat bestowed on the regulation of the inundation seems to have been the
                    great object of his reign. The rocks of Semneh and Knmmeh bear registers of the
                    height of the Nile in several <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0758-0735"/> years of his reign. His great enterprise, the
                    most successful of its kind ever carried out in Egypt, was the construction of a
                    vast artificial reservoir, Lake Mceris, in the province now called the Feiyoom,
                    which received the waters of the Nile by a canal, and after the inundation
                    spread them over the country. Its fisheries were also very valuable. Through the
                    neglect of ages the site of Lake Moeris was forgotten until, in our time, M.
                    Linant traced it. Near the lake, Amenemhat III. built the famous Labyrinth, of
                    which the remains were discovered by Dr Lepsius during the Prussian Expedition
                    to Egypt, and there raised a pyramid. The use of the Labyrinth is unknown; the
                    pyramid was no doubt the royal tomb. Its moderate dimensions and the vast size
                    of the lake show a remarkable contrast to the earlier great pyramids, with
                    apparently no corresponding work of public usefulness. At the time which
                    produced the Lake Moeris civilization had reached a point far above that of the
                    age of Khufu, perhaps the highest Egypt has ever known. Of the short reigns of
                    Amenemhat IV. and Queen Sebek-nefru-ra we know nothing, but that with the latter
                    the dynasty came to a close.</p>
                <p>With the accession of Dynasty XIII. we reach the third chasm in the Egyptian
                    monumental records. This line, Theban like its predecessor, but with a special
                    favour for Middle Egypt (c∕. Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2&lt;j ed.
                    115), seems to have ruled all Egypt. Its power, however, was evidently weakened,
                    either by external war or by internal dissension. Many monuments may have been
                    lost or may yet lie hid in the mounds of towns of Middle Egypt, but the
                    scantiness of records of public works is a proof of its weakness. Where are its
                    tablets in the quarries? In the Turin Papyrus are preserved the lengths of
                    several of the reigns of its kings, who generally bore the names Sebek-hotep or
                    Nefer-hotep. The longest reign is 13 years, and but one other reaches 10, the
                    total of 13 reigns being but 48 years 22 days, and 6 sums of months and 7 of
                    days effaced. Putting the total at 50 years, the allowance for each reign is
                    under 4 years. This must have been a time of disturbance, but not necessarily of
                    disastrous wars <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> if we compare the rule of the
                    second line of Memlook sultans we obtain an average reign of 5 years each. This
                    we know to have been the consequence of domestic disturbance, and not of great
                    public disasters at home or abroad. Dynasty XIV., of Xoïtes, the next in
                    Manetho’s list, is the first which had certainly its capital in the Delta.
                    Beyond this fact we can only conjecture its importance and chronological
                    place.</p>
                <p>The invasion and conquest, at least in part, of Egypt by the Hyksos, or Shepherd
                    Kings, is undoubtedly the chief cause of the obscurity of this age. The event
                    did not happen until at least some time after the beginning of Dynasty XIII.,
                    for the eighteenth king of that line in the Turin Papyrus, who bears the
                    significant name Mer-mesha, “the general,” has left a record at Tanis near the
                    eastern frontier, which was probably the chief city of at least one dynasty of
                    the invaders.</p>
                <p>Manetho, as cited by Josephus, allows for the stay of the foreigners in Egypt a
                    period of 511 years, which has been supposed to be about the interval beween
                    Dynasty XII. and Dynasty XVIII., by which they were expelled. This number,
                    however, rests upon the single evidence of J osephus, and is moreover probably
                    made up of sums of dynasties, which would render its evidence doubtful. A better
                    means of measuring the period would be afforded by the monumental evideuce that
                    a Shepherd king ruled 400 years before Ramses II. could we place this foreign
                    sovereign. All that can be said as to the chronology is that Dynasty XV. and
                    XVI. were probably of Shepherds, and Dynasty XVII. was certainly Theban. Judging
                    from the numbering, it is probable that there was a break in rhe Theban
                    succession, and that the two Shepherd dynasties were successive, the Xoïtes
                    perhaps being but a provincial line.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Tablet of 400 Years states that this period elapsed from
                    some point in the reign of the Shepherd king Set-aa-pehti Nub to some point in
                    that of Ramses II., and again Apepee, whose name corresponds to the Apophis of
                    Manetho, almost immediately preceded Dynasty XVIII. Apophis is mentioned among
                    the only Shepherd kings Manetho names. In the passage preserved by Josephus
                    these are called the first Shepherd rulers, who very properly compose the first
                    Shepherd dynasty, the XVth, in the epitome of Africanus; though Eusebius
                    transfers them to Dynasty XVII., perhaps knowing they immediately preceded
                    Dynasty XVIII. In Africanus, Dynasty XVI. is of Shepherds and XVII. of Shepherds
                    and Thebans. If the identification of Apepee with the Apophis of Dynasty XV.
                    were certain we might have a rough measure of the time of the Shepherd rule, but
                    this is not proved.</p></note></p>
                <p>The story of the Hyksos is thus told by Manetho. Under a king called Timaios, or
                    Timaos (not recognized in the list or on the monuments), certain invaders from
                    the East conquered Egypt without a battle, destroying the temples and slaying or
                    enslaving the people. At length they made one of themselves, Salatis by name,
                    king, who ruled at Memphis, and made all Egypt tributary. For the better
                    protection of the eastern border he rebuilt and fortified the city Avaris, in
                    the Sethroite nome in Lower Egypt, where he kept a great force of soldiers. He
                    was succeeded by other kings mentioned by name, who, and their descendants, held
                    Egypt for 511 years. After this the kings of the Thebais and of the rest of
                    Egypt rose against the Shepherd rule, and a great and long war was waged, until
                    Misphragmuthosis drove the Shepherds out of all Egypt except Avaris, where his
                    son Tuthmosis besieged them, and failing to take the place agreed to a
                    capitulation, on the condition that they should be allowed to leave the country.
                    Accordingly they went through the desert to Judaea and founded Jerusalem. They
                    were called Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, and, according to some, they were
                    Arabs.</p>
                <p>This narrative, notwithstanding a general confirmation from the monuments, is
                    evidently not wholly correct. In particular it is inconsistent with all other
                    evidence in attributing the foundation of Jerusalem to the Shepherds, which is
                    evidently the result of an endeavour to connect their departure with the Exodus.
                    Manetho seems to have preserved two Egyptian theories of the Exodus, which both
                    explained that event as the retreat of eastern invaders. M. Mariette’s
                    researches in the ruins of Tanis have brought to light monuments of the
                    Shepherds, and led to the discovery of others elsewhere, while M. de Bougé and
                    other scholars have explained Egyptian documents connected with the war of
                    independence. From these different sources we learn that the foreigners were of
                    the Shemite or a kindred type, resembling the modern inhabitants of the
                    north-east of Lower Egypt, who still retains the peculiarities already noticed
                    by Greek writers. Though their conquest may have been marked by violence, we
                    find them in their own monuments using and cultivating the manners and
                    civilization of Egypt, and even giving a new and characteristic development to
                    its art in their costly monoliths of granite, which show from their material
                    that their rule extended to the southern boundary of Egypt. The war of
                    independence arose between Apepee, one of their later kings, who is described as
                    worshipping Seth only, and one of the three Theban kings called on the monuments
                    Ra-skenen Taa, at this time apparently a tributary prince. The war, contrary to
                    Manetho’s statement, does not seem to have been of long continuance, having been
                    brought to a successful end by Aahmes, first king of Dynasty XVIII., between
                    whom and Ra-skenen Taa no great length of time can have elapsed. Manetho’s text
                    is again erroneous in making the conqueror Tuthmosis (Thothmes IV.), son
                    (grandson) of Misphragmuthosis (Thothmes III.), sixth <pb break="no"

                    list; but this may be a confusion due to copyists, as there is other evidence
                    that he placed the conquest of the Shepherds under Amosis, or Aahmes. The
                    expulsion of the foreigners was not so complete as Manetho would have us
                    imagine. Several names in their territory remained Shemite, or the population
                    non-Egyptian, and under Dynasty XIX. the prejudice that appears in Dynasty
                    XVIII. seems almost removed.</p>
                <p>It must be here noticed that Dr Brugsch has copied a remarkable inscription, from
                    the tomb at Eile thyia of Baba, whom he assigns to the latter part of Dynasty
                    XVII., in which mention is made of a famine of successive years. “A famine
                    having broken out during many years, I gave corn to the town during each
                    famine.” There are but two known instances in history of a famine in Egypt
                    lasting several years, the seven years’ famine of Joseph and the seven years’
                    famine of the Fâtimee caliph El-Mustansir. Dr Brugsch has, therefore, argued
                    with high probability that Baba records the famine of Joseph, and that the old
                    tradition that Joseph governed Egypt under the Shepherd King Apophis is a true
                    one (c∕. <hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> p. 735, note 1). To this we shall recur
                    in speaking of the Exodus. (See Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 2 ed.

                    fixed. Manetho’s list is here in a very corrupt state. Certain numbers can be

                    others, we obtain a sum of not greatly over two hundred years for the line,
                    supposing it to end with the accession of Ramses I. It must, however, be
                    remembered that those numbers which are provisionally accepted are manifestly

                    supreme rule over the various princes of Egypt, without abolishing their rights,
                    and to have gained Ethiopian support by his marriage with Nefru-ari, daughter of
                    a king of Ethiopia. He then directed his whole power to the final liberation of
                    Egypt. The tomb at Eilethyia of Aahmes son of Abuna, an officer of the Egyptian
                    flotillas, in an inscription relating his services, throws light on the events
                    of th⅛ war. He passed his early youth in the fortress of Eilethyia, one of the
                    strong positions where the kings of Dynasty XVII. rallied their subjects. In the
                    reign of Aahmes he was made officer of the ship called the “Calf.” Later he went
                    to the flotilla of the north to fight. It was during the siege of the fortress
                    of Avaris. He served in the vessel “Ruling in Memphis,” a name no doubt given to
                    commemorate the addition of the ancient capital to the dominions of Aahmes. An
                    engagement took place on the water near Avaris. Subsequently Avaris was taken,
                    and the young officer carried off three captives, whom the king granted him as
                    slaves. This was in the. fifth year of Aahmes; in the next we read of the
                    conquest of Sharuhan, the Sharuhen of the book of Joshua, in the south-west of
                    Palestine. The memoir then adds that, after having slain the Shepherds of Asia,
                    the king undertook a successful expedition against an Ethiopian country. (See
                    Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 1 ed. 80, 81.)</p>
                <p>This narrative, while generally confirming Manetho’s story, corrects it in some
                    particulars. It states that Avaris was taken, not that it capitulated, and
                    indicates a pursuit of the enemy within the territory of Palestine, where they
                    were again conquered in a city which they attempted to hold. The Ethiopian
                    expedition was a reassertion of the Egyptian domiuion to the south. Two tablets
                    in the Turk quarries record how, in the twenty-second year of his reign, Aahmes
                    restored the temples which had fallen into decay, the blocks being removed by
                    bulls under the charge of Phoenicians? (Fenkhu) (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.,</hi> 2 ed. 173, 174). It may be recollected that the Phoenicians appear
                    as skilled smiths and masons in the time of Solomon, and that as early as the
                    Exodus they were already great metalworkers.</p>
                <p>From the time of Aahmes till the close of Dynasty XX. we may reckon the rise,
                    fulness, and decay of the Egyptian Empire. It is a period of abundant monuments,
                    sculptured and painted, and of many papyri, rich in records of the history,
                    manners, and religion of Egypt. The state of the country may be glanced at in
                    this place, where the Shepherd period closes, so as not to break the continuity
                    of the subsequent history.</p>
                <p>The sudden growth of prosperity at home and power abroad which marks the early
                    reigns of Dynasty XV1II. is truly surprising. The Egypt of Dynasty XVII. is
                    broken up and only slowly reuniting; that of Dynasty XVIII. is at once solidly
                    bound together, and soon to engage in designs of world-dominion never hinted at
                    in earlier times. These conditions were the result of a great national war, in
                    which the country discovered her hidden force, and was not content to use it
                    only so far as was needful to make a strong Egypt like that of Dynasty XII.
                    Having conquered her foreign rulers at home, she desired to add their native
                    lands to her own dominions. The first effects of these designs were the
                    enrichment of Egypt. In the early reigns of this house the wealth of the
                    subjects as of the king rapidly grew. From the simple monuments of Dynasty XVII.
                    and the first kings of Dynasty XVI IT. there is a sudden advance to richness and
                    splendour. Egypt was, however, becoming a military state. The king is constantly
                    more powerful, and his public works more magnificent; the subjects,
                    notwithstanding the luxury of individuals, have not that solid princely strength
                    that we admire in those of the Pyramid kings and Dynasty XII. The appearance of
                    the horse under this dynasty is most significant. The beasts of burden, the ox
                    and ass, now yield in importance to the war-horse, and the landed proprietor
                    journeys in his car whose ancestor went afoot staff in hand. Thus the military
                    man succeeds the farmer. The priest is no longer a great man who has assumed
                    sacerdotal functions, but one of a class immensely extended, reaching from the
                    highest dignitaries, one of whom, strengthened by hereditary power, could at
                    last seize the throne, down to the menial class who lived upon the superstitions
                    of the people. To carry on the government there grew side by side with soldiers
                    and priests a vast official body, clever, ambitious, and unscrupulous, which
                    rapidly on the true bureaucratic principle in- volved the administration in an
                    entanglement which must have mainly led to the decline of the Empire. Justice,
                    which was difficult at home, must have been almost impossible abroad. We now
                    cease to hear of hereditary nomarchs studying the welfare of provinces to which
                    they were attached by ancestral connection. All posts went by the royal favour.
                    The common people fared ill in this age. Their function was to supply soldiers
                    for the army and navy, and at first to take their share in the construction of
                    public works; their only hope was to rise in the official class. Handicrafts and
                    all labour were beneath a gentleman; hence no one could rise to his grade but
                    through success at the schools, which were open to every one, and where a boy of
                    talent had his chance of a career <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Brugsch., <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 1 ed. 16, 17).</p>
                <p>Of the administration of provinces and conquered states we know little. Lower
                    Ethiopia had always been ruled as a part of Egypt; this system was extended
                    southward. At first the eastern states only paid tribute. Ultimately garrisons
                    were placed in Palestine and Phoenicia (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 1
                    ed. 135). Compared with the Assyrians the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0760-0737"/> Egyptians were civilized conquerors, and the
                    sculptures of their battles do not represent any scenes of extreme cruelty. They
                    do not, however, seem to have known the art of effectually holding their
                    acquisitions, which had to be reconquered over and over again, until the
                    inevitable tide of conquest on the other side set in, and the Empire fell.</p>
                <p>On examining the earliest monuments of Dynasty XVIII. we are startled by their
                    astonishing resemblance to those of Dynasty XI., a resemblance which would, had
                    we no historical evidence on the other side, justify the leap of the Tablet of
                    Abydos from Dynasty XII. to XVIII. This may be partly explained as a renaissance
                    of art due to a royal descent traced rather to Dynasty XI. than Dynasty XII.
                    Similarly under Dynasty XXVI. there was a renaissance of the art of the age of
                    the early Memphite Dynasties. We must also not lose sight of the local character
                    of Egyptian art and its intense conservatism, which may have preserved an
                    ancient type through many centuries. The early art of Dynasty XVIII. has this
                    character of a survival; that of Dynasty XXVI. is clearly a modern
                    imitation.</p>
                <p>The art of this age is in some respects the finest Egypt produced; it is,
                    perhaps, best about the time of Thothmes III. and Amenophis IL, the middle of
                    Dynasty XVIII. It is inferior in naturalism to the art of Dynasty IV., and in
                    delicacy to that of Dynasty XII., but it has a certain splendour before wanting.
                    After it had attained its highest point it slowly declined, partly from a decay
                    in the vigour of the national character, perhaps more from the vast size of the
                    later monuments, which must have led to a neglect of finish in the details,
                    though this neglect can only be seen by one who is thoroughly acquainted with
                    the Egyptian styles. At all times there is an invincible patience in the mastery
                    of material and the execution of detail. The temples, not the kings’ tombs, are
                    now the largest and most costly edifices; though a compromise with the old idea
                    is effected by making grand temples as sepulchral chapels in religious
                    connection with the royal tombs, commemorating in their sculptures the events of
                    the reigns. The tombs of subjects do not maintain the proportion the earlier
                    ones hold to the royal sepulchres. Their paintings have less of daily life, and
                    religion takes a greater and growing place on the walls. We have, however, a
                    multitude of interesting scenes, which show us a life more luxurious in the many
                    than that of earlier times, but not as splendid in the few. There is more of
                    feasting, of music, and the dance, less of country life and the welfare of the
                    retainers. The royal tombs are now grottoes deeply cut in the rock, and the
                    pictures of their walls are religious, the historical part being left to the
                    funereal temples.</p>
                <p>Amenhotep or Amenophis I., son of Aahmes and his Ethiopian queen, carried on the
                    Ethiopian wars. It is of his son, the next king, Thothmes T., that the great
                    eastern campaigns are first recorded. He advanced as far as the Euphrates, and
                    must therefore have subdued, or at least marched through, the greatest part of
                    Phoenicia and Syria. The prosperity of Egypt at this time is shown by the
                    splendid works he executed in the great temple of Amen-ra at Thebes, the
                    earliest of their kind that we can trace, and apparently the beginning of the
                    series which was only to cease with the fall of the Empire. The employment of
                    captives in public works was the main means by which they could be carried out.
                    Probably after a time all that Egypt could do was to furnish men for the army,
                    and in even this she failed when the dynasty came to an end. Before his death
                    Thothmes I. had associated with him on the throne his daughter Hatshepu, or
                    Hatasu (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 201), who succeeded him with
                    her elder brother and husband Thothmes II. Her power is an evidence of the
                    importance the</p>
                <p>Egyptians attached to the female line. At the same time their dislike to be
                    governed by a queen is evident in the attempt she subsequently made to assume
                    the character of a king, being represented in male attire, a circumstance to
                    which the monuments present no parallel.</p>
                <p>After the seemingly uneventful reign of Thothmes II., Hatshepu was associated,
                    apparently as regent, with her younger brother Thothmes III., and usurped the
                    sole power. It is in this time that she appears as a king. She continued the
                    works of the temple of Amen-ra, where the great obelisk and its fallen fellow
                    bear her name. Her most interesting achievement was an expedition to Punt,
                    either the Somâlee country or Arabia Felix. She collected a fleet on the Red
                    Sea, and herself commanded it. The people accepted her rule, and she brought
                    back great tribute, including small spice-trees, which she planted at Thebes.
                    The glimpse we thus gain into the state of the civilization of the spice-growing
                    countries at this remote age is most valuable, and explains the facility with
                    which the southern dominions of Egypt were held. The nations in this direction
                    were not masses of barbarous tribes, but their civilization did not take the
                    direction of the pursuits of war.</p>
                <p>Hatshepu had reigned about twenty-one years when Thothmes III. succeeded her. He
                    carefully effaced her name on the monuments, substituting that of his brother
                    and his own, and reckoned his reign from her accession. Whether he thus included
                    his brother’s reign or not we do not know. With the sole reign of Thothmes III.
                    a series of great expeditions begins, from the records of which we have great
                    insight into the condition of Syria and Palestine about the 15 th century
                    B.c.</p>
                <p>It will be well here to glance for a moment at the Egyptian geography of this
                    territory. There is great difficulty in explaining it, probably due to the
                    different names apparently given to the same countries and peoples at one and
                    the same time or at different times. We may, however, gain somewhat in clearness
                    by observing that more than one important geographical name can only be an
                    Egyptian appellative. Thus the Shasu, who were wander-, ing Arabs of the desert,
                    who moved up as now into Palestine for pasturage or on predatory excursions, are
                    nothing but “robbers." Most other names may be probably identified with Semitic
                    equivalents. Syria is called Khal: this word is connected with Syria by the late
                    equivalent Asher <hi rend="italic">(ef.</hi> Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Bist.
                    Aηc.,</hi> 181, note 1), which shows that the Egyptians then identified Syria
                    and Assyria. The great nation of Syria in the time of Thothmes III. was the
                    Ruten. These may be the Shemites of the stock of Lud, and may be also the
                    Lydians in a primitive seat. Under Ramses II. the Kheta, a northern division of
                    the Hittites, held the political position of the Ruten, as though the Ruten had
                    migrated. As the Ruten probably represent the Aramaeans, so the Hittites
                    represent the Canaanites. The Phoenicians appear to be the Kefa; in the time of
                    Thothmes III. they held an insular position in the Mediterranean, probably
                    Cyprus; under Ptolemy III., they give their name to Phoenicia. They are clearly
                    the Biblical Caphtorim. The Philistines do not appear until the time of Ramses
                    III. None of the primitive nations whom the Bible mentions as supplanted in the
                    period before Joshua have been traced on the monuments, nor is there any clear
                    notice before the time of Sheshonk I. (Shishak) of the Terahites. The period of
                    Thothmes III. is one of Aramaean supremacy, that of Ramses II. of Canaanite;
                    together they well correspond to the age before the Israelite conquest, while
                    the condition of the time of Ramses III. suits the latest age of the Judges. The
                    names of towns present less difficulty. Many are traceable in Biblical
                    geography, and here but one indication occurs which may point to Israelite
                    occupation.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian conquests on the east being tributary, there were constant revolts
                    on the accession of new sovereigns. It was thus that Thothmes III., on becoming
                    sole ruler, had immediately to reduce the Ruten and their neighbours. This
                    caused the series of eastern campaigns, which began in the twenty-second year,
                    very early in his sole reign, and certainly extended to the forty-second, during
                    which -whole time there was seldom a year of repose. The history of these wars
                    is told in the Annals of Thothmes III., which contrast favourably with those of
                    the Assyrian kings.</p>

                <p>If they were marked by barbarity, there is no boast of ought but conquest and the
                    levying of tribute. The tribute no less than a contemporary painting shows the
                    great material civilization of the Asiatic states. Throughout, the Ruten are the
                    most formidable enemies; the Kheta only appear. The first great achievement was
                    the defeat before Megiddo of a confederacy led by the prince of Ketesh, or
                    Kadesh on the Orontes. In the battle only 83 of the enemy were killed, and 340
                    taken prisoners; but the magnitude of the success is proved by the capture of
                    2232 horses, 924 chariots, and the speedy surrender of Megiddo. This town, as in
                    Josiah’s time, was the key of the route to the Euphrates, and on its capture the
                    king of the Ruten and the king of Assur are mentioned as becoming tributaries.
                    In the course of the wars Kadesh was captured twice, and the king of Egypt
                    marched as far as Nineveh, and the name of Babel is mentioned. The reign of
                    Thothmes was also marked by expeditions in Ethiopia, and then we first meet with
                    the supposed Egyptian name of the Danai, with whom he came in contact during
                    some expedition in the Mediterranean. Great buildings commemorate this active
                    reign, and we have a glimpse of the personal character of the king in the
                    eccentric architecture of one of his additions to the temple of Amen-ra at
                    Thebes. After a reign of 54 years 11 months, reckoning from the accession of
                    Hatshepu, Thothmes III. was succeeded by his son Amenophis II.</p>
                <p>The accession of the new king was marked by a war in Assyria, in which he
                    captured Nineveh. An incident of his eastern campaigns is remarkable for its
                    Oriental barbarism. He brought back to Egypt the bodies of seven kings whom he
                    had slain with his own hands. The heads of six were placed on the walls of
                    Thebes; the seventh was sent to remote Napata in Ethiopia to be hung on the
                    walls to strike terror into the negroes. After a prosperous but probably short
                    reign, Amenophis II. was succeeded by his son Thothmes IV., of whom we only know
                    that he maintained his father’s empire during a reign that probably did not
                    exceed the nine years assigned to him by Manetho.</p>
                <p>Amenophis III. succeeded his father, and, during a long and it seems mainly
                    pacific reign, occupied himself in great architectural works. Two temples at
                    Thebes owe their origin to him, that on the western bank, which was the funereal
                    temple of his tomb in the western valley beyond, and of which little now remains
                    but the two great statues in the plain, the Vocal Memnon and its fellow, and
                    also the temple of El-Uksur on the eastern bank. In his time the dimensions of
                    the structures of the earlier kings are surpassed, and the proportions of the
                    greatest monuments of the Empire are almost attained. Probably he was the first
                    of the family after Aahmes who took a foreigner to wife. On the great scarabaei
                    which commemorate his marriage with Queen Taï, we are informed that his rule
                    extended from Mesopotamia to Southern Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>Amenophis IV., the son of this foreign marriage, is the most perplexing character
                    in ancient Egyptian history. Under his mother’s influence he introduced a new
                    religion, the worship of Aten, the solar disk, and after a time wholly
                    suppressed the national religion, even changing his name to Khu-n-aten.
                    Abandoning Thebes as the capital, he founded a new city in Middle Egypt, where
                    he constructed a chief temple to Aten, and near which his officials excavated
                    their tombs in the mountain. The type under which the king and his family and
                    subjects are represented is unlike any other in Egyptian art. They are all of
                    emaciated and distended figure, and surpassing ugliness. The king is treated
                    with a servile respect nowhere else seen on the monuments. His troops are mixed
                    with foreign mercenaries. But we do not hear of foreign expeditions; every one
                    is occupied in the duties of the new religion, without polytheism or idols.
                    Flowers are the chief offerings and adorn the temple throughout; hymns chanted
                    to the sound of harps are the form of worship. Was this a foreign religion, or
                    an Egyptian restoration of primitive belief? If it were Egyptian why was the sun
                    called Aten, not Ra? The king was the son of a foreigner, and his type and that
                    which marks his court, probably because some were of his mother’s race, and art
                    assumed the fashionable type for the rest, is not recognizable in any of the
                    characteristic representations of foreign races. It is neither Ethiopian nor
                    Shemite nor Libyan. The names of his mother and of her parents, the name of the
                    sun-god, which is Egyptian, and the character of the worship, do not as far as
                    we know point to any of these races. Certainly they are not Semitic. For race
                    and religion we must probably look beyond the horizon of the Egyptian conquests.
                    The type is not without an Indian aspect, and the religion has in its simplicity
                    and the character of its worship a striking likeness to Vedism.</p>
                <p>Khu-n-aten had seven daughters and no son. His successor Aï was his
                    foster-brother and the husband of his eldest daughter. Under him the national
                    religion was tolerated. Two other sons-in-law succeeded. Their line then or soon
                    after came to an end, on the accession of Harem-heb, or Horus, who claimed to be
                    the legitimate successor of Amenophis III., either by descent or on account of
                    the innovations of Khu-n-aten, who with the kindred kings does not appear in the
                    monumental lists, in which Har-em-heb is seen as the immediate successor of
                    Amenophis III. The same order is followed in Manetho’s list, in which the house
                    of Khu-n-aten follows Horus. What time this line lasted we do not know. Probably
                    it did not exceed a generation. Horus occupied himself in destroying the
                    monuments of Khu-n-aten and his successors, and no doubt in fully restoring the
                    national religion.</p>
                <p>Another family gained the throne after the reign of Horus, that of the
                    Ramessides, forming Dynasties XIX. and XX.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The chronology of Dynasty XIX. presents one great
                    difficulty. We cannot determine the length of the reign of Setee I. Manetho
                    assigns him more than 50 years, which is most improbable, as Ramses reigned 6 7
                    years, and his father and mother were married before his father’s succession.
                    Ramses dates from his accession as sole king, and therefore we cannot include a
                    period of co-regency in the Manethonian numbers for Sethos. The size and beauty
                    of Setee’s tomb would imply a reign of not under 30 years. The length of the
                    Dynasty cannot have been less than 130 years, and was perhaps as much as 150. It
                    comprised three generations and the rest of the probably long life of the king
                    (Setee II.) whose birth marked the third, which would give 100 + 40 ?) about 140
                    years for the total duration.</p></note> Ramses I., who seems to have been of
                    Lower Egyptian extraction, and not impossibly connected by ancestry with the
                    Shepherd kings, seized the royal power, maintained his authority abroad by
                    campaigns in the south and the east, and concluded a treaty of peace with the
                    king of the Hittites. After a very short reign he left the crown to his son
                    Setee I., or Sethos, who strengthened his rights by marrying Taï, a
                    granddaughter of Amenophis III. Ramses II., the son of this marriage, thus
                    became legitimate king, and Setee made him his colleague at a very early age, no
                    doubt to conciliate the Egyptians, a position at first ignored, evidently owing
                    to the difficulty of defining it, but which ended in the virtual abdication of
                    Setee (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Λnc.,</hi> 215-217). The troubles that
                    preceded the reign of Ramses I. must have weakened the foreign dominion of
                    Egypt. Wars in the east occupied the earliest years of Setee. The Kheta had now
                    succeeded to the Ruten in the supremacy of Northern Syria. Although Setee
                    conquered the Kheta and captured Kadesh, now their chief town, the war ended by
                    the conclusion of a second treaty between the Egyptian and Hittite kings. It is
                    not necessary to suppose, with M. Maspero <hi rend="italic">{Hist. Anc.,</hi>
                    215), that the Egyptian Empire was already waning, because it was thus barred
                    off from Further Asia and obliged to meet the Hittite king on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0762-0739"/> equal terms. The conditions were no doubt changed
                    from those of the time of Thothmes III., but the list of the confederacy which
                    the next king of the Kheta led against Ramses II., compared with that which
                    Thothmes defeated at Megiddo, shows that the Kheta could bring into the field
                    much more formidable allies than did the Ruten. Moreover there was a change in
                    the foreign policy of Egypt. Phoenicia and Palestine were ruled by means of a
                    chain of fortresses held by Egyptian garrisons. (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist.,</hi> 1 ed. 135; Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 215.) If the
                    Empire was narrowed in its limits, it was more solidly ruled; and this is quite
                    consistent with the conclusion of a treaty with the Kheta. As a builder Setee I.
                    is only equalled by Ramses II. He constructed the great hall of columns of
                    El-Karnak, on the outside of the north wall of which he commemorated his
                    victories in a series of most interesting sculptures. His splendid tomb is in
                    the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings.</p>
                <p>Ramses II. is without doubt the greatest figure in the long line of the Pharaohs,
                    and at the same time he is the one of whose character we have the best idea. His
                    early training was in war and in government, for it cannot be a pure figure of
                    speech by which the tablet found near Dakkeh in Nubia says that when he was but
                    ten years old no monuments were executed without his orders (Brugsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 1 ed. 137). This position was due to his superior
                    right to the throne. Before the death of Setee I. the maritime nations of the
                    Mediterranean made a descent on Egypt. The Shardana, or Sardones, and the
                    Tuirsha, or Tyrseni, allied with the Libyans in this enterprise. Rainses
                    defeated them so effectually that they do not seem to have again attacked Egypt
                    till the reign of his son Menptah, about seventy years or more later. The
                    captives of the Shardana instead of being employed in public works were enrolled
                    in the king’s guard. After an expedition against Ethiopia, Ramses, on the death
                    of Setee, returned to Egypt. Early in his sole reign the peace between the
                    Egyptians and the Hittites was broken. The king of the Hittites formed a great
                    confederacy. The nations of Asia Minor, the Mysians, the Lycians, the Dardans,
                    the people of Ilium, are found in the list of the poem of Pentaur, the Egyptian
                    Ramesseid, which appropriately records the oldest war in which Troy had a part.
                    To bring together the army of the confederates time must have been needed.
                    Probably the war was determined on by the Hittites on the accession of the new
                    king. The great campaign was that of the fifth year of Ramses. The decisive
                    battle was preceded by a repulse, when the Egyptian army, deceived by the Arabs
                    (Shasu), were suddenly, while on the march, attacked and routed by the enemy,
                    who numbered no less than 2500 warchariots. It was only by the personal bravery
                    of Ramses that the Egyptians escaped destruction. This incident is the main
                    subject of the poem of Pentaur. But on the next day the great battle was fought;
                    the confederates were beaten and retreated into Kadesh. The Hittite king now
                    sued for peace, which was granted. It was speedily broken. In his eighth year
                    Ramses took Shalam, probably Salem or Jerusalem, Maram (Merom), and Tapur
                    (Dabir? near Mount Tabor), Bethanath, and Kanιon. In his eleventh year he
                    captured Ascalon. The war does not seem to have been ended until the Hittite
                    king Khetasar proposed conditions of peace which he brought to Ramses written on
                    a silver tablet. The treaty concluded on these bases in the twenty-first year of
                    Ramses is sculptured at El-Karnak. It is a most interesting document, being an
                    alliance offensive and defensive, with articles of extradition, remarkable for
                    their humanity, and others for the protection of commerce (Maspero, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 222, 223). Both kings swore to observe the
                    compact, which was a renewal of the previous treaties. It is remarkable that in
                    this document the Hittite prince, instead of being called the “vile chief of the
                    Kheta,” is now the “great king,” the style given to Ramses also. Γhe eldest
                    daughter of the Hittite king was taken in marriage as queen by Ramses, in whose
                    twenty-third year Khetasar visited his son-in-law in Egypt. This alliance does
                    not seem to have been broken for full a century, and then by conquerors who
                    overcame the resistance of the Kheta and carried them with them. The remainder
                    of the reign of Ramses appears to have been undisturbed by great wars, and given
                    up to those vast buildings which are found throughout Egypt and Nubia, and which
                    give him the first place among the architect Pharaohs. About the thirtieth year
                    of his reign, his fourth son, the eldest surviving, -was made regent, and on the
                    death of this prince in the fiftyfifth year, Menptah the thirteenth son, now
                    heir, took this post, holding it for the rest of his father’s reign, which ended
                    in the sixty-seventh year. Ramses must then have been at least near a hundred
                    years old, perhaps more.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>M. Maspero thinks Ramses II. was at least 50 in the 21st year of his reign
                    <hi rend="italic">{Hist. Aηc.,</hi> 250). This would make him at least 93 at the
                    time of his death, and 30 at his accession. The latter age is barely
                    reconcilable with the fact of three of his sons of the restricted class, which
                    is evidently composed of the children of successive queens, being engaged in the
                    campaign of the 5th year. Putting his marriage at 16, we must allow at least 4
                    years for the birth of these three sons, and cannot suppose the youngest to have
                    gone to war in his chariot under the age of 1 4. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> so
                    (16 + 4 + 14 = ) 34 is the lowest age for the fifth year, and 29 for the
                    accession, or 49 for the 21st year. But it is obvious that probability is
                    against these extreme limits, and the fact that Ramses outlived twelve of his
                    sons of the shorter list is in favour of a greater age.</p></note> He married
                    three queens, and apparently had by them 23 sons and at least 13 daughters. The
                    whole number of his children was 170, of whom 111 were sons and 59 daughters.
                    All are styled princes or princesses, but probably only the children of queens
                    had the right of succession.</p>
                <p>Menptah succeeded Ramses II. There are but few monuments of his reign. The
                    principal event they relate is a great incursion into the Delta of the maritime
                    nations of the Mediterranean allied with the Libyans. By this time the Pelasgic
                    tribes had wrested the dominion of the sea from the Phoenicians. »Some causes,
                    perhaps famines, had already disposed them to move from Asia Minor and the Greek
                    islands, seeking new establishments in Egypt. The attempt that Ramses II.
                    defeated in the lifetime of Setee</p>
                <p>I. was now renewed, apparently on a more formidable scale. The king of the Rebu
                    (Libyans), with the warriors of several tribes joined the Shardana (Sardones),
                    the Shakalasha (Sikels), the Leku (Lycians), the Tuirsha (Tyrseni), and the
                    Akaiusha (Achaeans). They had already entered Egypt and spread themselves over
                    the west of the Delta, where they intended to settle, when the Egyptian forces
                    attacked them and put them to rout after a battle of six hours’ duration. It is
                    remarkable that in this confederacy the Shakalasha and Akaiusha are added to the
                    former list, and the Leku, who were in the Hittite confederacy against Ramses
                    II., now appear on the west. Everything indicates the growing strength of the
                    maritime nations and that power of united action which marked the period of the
                    Trojan War. For the time the invasion was checked, but the Empire was evidently
                    failing. The Hittites, indeed, were true to the treaty, and during famine were
                    supplied with corn from Egypt, and the external provinces seem to have continued
                    quiet. But side by side with the kingly power that of the high priests of
                    Amen-ra had grown to formidable dimensions, owing probably to the interest
                    Ramses</p>
                <p>II. and Menptah showed for Lower Egypt, which put the weight of Thebes on the
                    side of the highest local functionary. Menptah was not immediately followed by
                    his son Setee II. There intervened two reigns, those of Amen-meses and Siptali,
                    the first of the Ramses family by descent, the second, apparently, by marriage.

                    Setee II. succeeded them and restored the legitimate line. His reign dosed in
                    anarchy. There was no longer one king: the chiefs of the nomes ruled and engaged
                    in civil war. A worse period followed. A Syrian, Arisu by name, became chief of
                    the nomarchs, society was dissolved, and the templeservices neglected. We are as
                    yet unable to say how this revolution began. It seems to have had nothing to do
                    with foreign wars, but to have been brought about by internal weakness. The time
                    it lasted must have been long, according to the Papyrus of Ramses III., from
                    which alone we know of it. There “many years” are assigned to the period of the
                    nomarchs and “years” to the rule of the Syrian.</p>
                <p>As the Exodus is now generally held to have occurred in the later years of
                    Dynasty XIX., its place in Egyptian history may best be here noticed. The view
                    referred to was first carefully worked out by Prof. Lepsius. It rests upon
                    chronological and historical grounds. Manetho, apparently adopting a tradition,
                    placed the Exodus in the reign of Menptah. The number of generations assigned in
                    the Bible to the interval from the Exodus to Solomon would bring the former
                    event to about the same time. This approximative date is in accordance with that
                    of the Rabbinical chronology, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 1314-13. The
                    coincidence is, however, valueless, for the interval from the Exodus to the
                    building of Solomon’s Temple, in the Rabbinical chronology, is that of the
                    Hebrew text, 480 years. The date of the Exodus should therefore be about <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 1480. The difference between 1480 and 1314-13 is
                    caused by an error in the date of the building of the Second Temple, which is
                    put <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 354, only 46 years before the date of
                    Alexander’s death, which is dated <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 308, or 15
                    years too late. There is thus a mistake of more than a century in so cardinal a
                    date as the building of the Second Temple. If an event of this importance,
                    occurring only 800 years before the drawing up of the chronology, is thus
                    incorrectly dated, and a period of Jewish history obliterated, surely the date
                    of the Exodus cannot rest upon any accurate information. The historical grounds
                    are far stronger than the chronological. Manetho, relating, if we may trust

                    here confirmed by the evidence which the narrative shows of historical
                    inaccuracy, has given an account of the Exodus from an Egyptian point of view.
                    This story is the fullest version of one current in various forme in antiquity.
                    As Manetho tells it, the chief points are these. King Amenophis, identified by
                    him with Menptah, who occurs in his lists as Amenophis and Ammenephthis,
                    determined, under the advice of a priest of the same name as himself, Amenophis
                    the son of Papis, to cleanse Egypt of all lepers and other unclean persons,
                    whom, accordingly, he set to work in the quarries. On their petition he gave
                    them the city Avaris, left in ruins by the Shepherds. Having occupied the city,
                    they chose one of themselves, a priest of Heliopolis, by name Osarsiph, as their
                    ruler, who changed his name to Moyses. He made laws particularly directed
                    against the Egyptian religion, and sent messengers to Jerusalem to the
                    Shepherds, who had been expelled by the Egyptians, asking their aid and
                    promising to give them their old territory Avaris, and to assist them to subdue
                    Egypt. Accordingly the Shepherds invaded Egypt, when Amenophis came against
                    them, but for superstitious reasons did not fight them, and withdrew to the
                    friendly king of Ethiopia, in whose country he remained thirteen years, his ally
                    protecting the southern Egyptian border. Meanwhile the people of Jerusalem and
                    the unclean Egyptians ravaged Egypt, and destroyed everything connected with the
                    national religion. Afterwards Amenophis and his son Sethos, also called
                    Ramesses, returned and expelled the Shepherds and the unclean people. Chaeremon
                    gives a similar account with the same name for the king. Lysimachus and Tacitus
                    vary in calling the king Bocchoris.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian evidence for the date of the Exodus would place it about this time.
                    The geographical inquiries of Lepsius have been carried on by Brugsch, who, in a
                    paper read before the Oriental Congress, has identified the principal
                    geographical names of the narrative of the oppression and of the Exodus
                    (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">H</hi><hi rend="italic">Exode).</hi> In particular,
                    Rameses is shown to have been another name of Tanis. The occurrence of this name
                    in Genesis and Exodus is most important as bearing on the date of the Exodus,
                    for it is almost certain that it was given by Ramses IL, who rebuilt the great
                    temple of the town. Another cardinal piece of evidence is the mention of the
                    ’Aperiu, or ’Apuriu, as engaged in public works under Ramses II. and later
                    kings, but not after Dynasty XX. In this name that of the Hebrews has been
                    recognized. If the identification were certain we should have much reason for
                    dating the oppression under Ramses IL, which would accord with the Exodus under
                    Menptah.</p>
                <p>The difficulties of this theory are not slight. On the chronological side
                    Manetho’s date is only dependent on a tradition, and we cannot fix the
                    chronology of the dynasty, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 1300 for Menptah being
                    about the middle point in a doubtful two centuries. The evidence of the Hebrew
                    genealogies therefore is not conclusive for a date identical with that of
                    Menptah, which we cannot yet say is irreconcilable with the chronology founded
                    on the interval of 480 years from the Exodus to the building of Solomon’s
                    Temple. If, however, the genealogies are to be taken as a guide for the
                    chronology up to the Exodus, Egyptologists prefer for the period of the sojourn
                    the longer intervals stated in the Hebrew text to the very short ones that would
                    result from the genealogical method. Still greater difficulties arise when we
                    give a critical examination to Manetho’s story. It reads like a perverted
                    narrative of the calamities which closed Dynasty XIX., for we cannot suppose two
                    conquests by Asiatics and two expulsions, one by Menptah and Setee IL, the other
                    by Set-nekht, who subdued the Syrian, nor resort to the violent hypothesis that
                    the Papyrus of Ramses III. attributes to Set-nekht that which Setee II.
                    achieved. The name of Amenophis is suspicious, the two names of his son Sethos,
                    “who is Ramesses,” still more so; the recall of the Shepherds from Jerusalem,
                    and the easy conquest of Egypt without a battle, all read like a legend founded
                    on a fusion of the two periods of Eastern occupation. There is, moreover,
                    another suspicious circumstance in the occurrence of the name of Bocchoris in
                    two versions of the story. This would either point to Bocchoris of Dynasty
                    XXIV., in whose time it is quite possiblo that there was a large number of
                    Israelite fugitives in Egypt, or to some other king of the same or a similar
                    name; we do not, however, know of any earlier Bocchoris. It may be reasonably
                    asked whether this story has anything to do with the Exodus. Those who hold that
                    it has yet, in common with all Egyptologists, argue, when they examine the
                    Biblical data, on the ground of the minute accuracy of many of these data. If,
                    then, the two narratives, that of Manetho and that of the Papyrus of Ramses
                    III., relate to the Exodus, it may reasonably be inferred that the Manethonian
                    is a faulty and distorted one. It is, however, quite possible that Manetho may
                    have known when the Exodus happened, and yet may have confused it with an event
                    of the same period. The argument from the Biblical data that Ramses II. ruled
                    during the oppression of the Israelites is very strong, though it may be
                    conjectured that a redactor has substituted the later name Rameses for the
                    earlier Zoan.</p>

                <p>The name of the Αρeriu, if certainly that of the Hebrews, would be decisive, but
                    it is not a proper Egyptian equivalent, and so exact are the transcriptions of
                    Semitic geographical names into Egyptian, that upon them mainly depends the
                    theory of the sounds of the Egyptian alphabet developed byM. de Rougé and
                    adopted by Dr Brugsch. Here, again, the evidence is inconclusive.</p>
                <p>The arguments which would place the Exodus in any other period of Egyptian
                    history are but slight. There is indeed the remarkable occurrence of a name
                    similar to that of Jacob, or identical with it, in a record^ the conquests of
                    Thothmes III.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In tins

                    suggests, but it would be more natural to take it to indicate that the Exodus
                    was anterior to the time of Thothmes, and there are other names in the list
                    which may possibly point to the same conclusion.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The chronology of Dynasties XX. and XXI. is
                    extremely obscure. We know that Ramses III. reigned 32years, and Ramses XI. or
                    XII. upwards of 32 years. The six successors of Ramses III. probably had very
                    short reigns, as all but the second and sixth were certainly sons of that king,
                    and the sixth probably. The other kings are represented by few monuments.
                    Her-har, however, may have had a longer reign, the sculptures of the temple of
                    Klιons at Thebes giving this impression. There does not seem, however, to be any
                    ground for a duration of more than a century until the Tanites of Dynasty XXI.
                    rose into power. The latest Theban kings probably held a local and constantly
                    diminishing authority for part of the time of the Tanites, of whom the records
                    are extremely scanty and the chronology consequently obscure. Two centuries is a
                    probable measure of the whole interval.</p></note> Yet the preponderance of
                    evidence is at present greatly in favour of the occurrence of the Exodus towards
                    the close of Dynasty XIX. It is not, however, necessary to accept the date of
                    Prof. Lepsius, in our present state of uncertainty as to the chronology of
                    Dynasty XIX. It is also not a necessary consequence of accepting this historical
                    synchronism, that we should take Manetho’s narrative of the Exodus as more than
                    his identification with it of an event of the same period. These may seem but
                    unsatisfactory results of the great erudition which has been bestowed on this
                    question. We refrain from speaking more positively when a discovery may at any
                    moment render speculation needless.</p>
                <p>If the Exodus took place towards the close of Dynasty XIX., when did the period
                    of oppression and the government of Joseph fall? The reckoning by generations
                    would place Joseph in the later part of Dynasty XVIII., and the oppression under
                    Ramses II. downwards. It is, however, very generally acknowledged that this
                    method of computation is not consistent with the growth of the Israelites from a
                    family to a nation during the sojourn in Egypt. Scholars are therefore disposed
                    to choose a reckoning by years. Here the Biblical data give either 430 years
                    exactly for the sojourn and 400 for the oppression, or else 215 years for the
                    sojourn. The longer periods are those generally preferred. If we reckon by them,
                    the government of Joseph would have fallen under the last Shepherd king, and the
                    oppression would have probably begun under Aahmes, to be greatly increased in
                    intensity under Ramses II.</p>
                <p>Set-nekht, a chief probably of the line of Ramses IL, overthrew the Syrian
                    intruder and again restored the Egyptian monarchy. His short reign, which begins
                    Dynasty XX., <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> was probably entirely occupied in
                    reorganizing the administration of Egypt. Ramses III., whom his father had
                    already made his colleague (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 262),
                    succeeded to a united Egypt but a distracted Empire. Evidently in the time of
                    anarchy every province and tributary state had fallen away. The new king was
                    equal to the effort of repelling invasion at home and reconquering lost
                    territory abroad. In his fifth year he defeated the Libyan tribes who had
                    invaded the west of Lower Egypt.</p>
                <p>In his eighth, he met another attack from the opposite quarter. The Taanau (Danai
                    Î) and the Takkaru (Teucrians), who now first appear, forming with the Tuirsha
                    (Tyrseni), Wa-shasha (Oscansl), Shakalasha (Sikels), Leka (Lycians), and Pelesta
                    (Philistines), a great confederation, which attacked the east of Egypt by sea
                    and land. Their army conquered and carried with i·t the Kheta and neighbouring
                    tribes. Their fleet, manned by the Takkaru and Shardana, reached Egypt at the
                    same time. The Egyptian army and fleet encountered and defeated them. This
                    campaign, and particularly the sea-fight, form the subjects of interesting
                    reliefs in the great sepulchral temple built by Ramses III. in western Thebes.
                    In his eleventh year a second invasion of the west of Egypt, by the Libyans,
                    aided by the Tuirsha and the Leka, was equally unsuccessful. The eastern
                    provinces and tributary states were recovered, and an expedition was sent to the
                    Somâlee country on the eastern coast of Africa or Arabia Felix. This last great
                    conqueror finally preserved Egypt from the maritime nations. The course of their
                    migrations seems to have been changed. All that remained of their invasions were
                    the Philistine settlement in Palestine and one of the Mashuasha, a Libyan tribe,
                    in the Delta, from whose race the Egyptians drew mercenaries (Maspero, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Λnc.,</hi> 266). The importance of these forces is evident
                    in the Biblical notices of Egypt of the time of the Hebrew kings.</p>
                <p>The historical value of the Egyptian notices of the primitive populations of the
                    Mediterranean is being more and more perceived. It is at first perplexing that
                    we find the nations afterwards settled in well-known seats either far to the
                    east or in constant movement. Yet the key thus afforded to the earliest Greek
                    colonization is most valuable, and it is significant of the historical character
                    of the documents that new names appear, as we should expect, in such a manner äs
                    to explain the confusion of the Greek terms, which speak of Achaeans and Danai,
                    Dardans and Teucri, at the same time indifferently, whereas the Egyptian
                    documents show that they are not interchangeable. Ramses III., besides
                    constructing the magnificent temple at Medeenet Haboo, enriched the temples of
                    Egypt with splendid gifts, during a prosperous reign of thirty-two years. The
                    later kings of the dynasty do not appear to have achieved anything remarkable.
                    They maintained the Empire, but their authority at home waned, while that of the
                    high-priests of Amen grew until, towards the close of the dynasty, Her-har, one
                    of these high-priests, gained the royal power. Probably the close of the dynasty
                    was occupied by a struggle between the last Ramesside kings and the
                    high-priests, as well as by the additional distraction caused by the rise of
                    another line, Dynasty XXI., of Tanite kings. Probably the Tanites ultimately
                    gained the sole authority. The high-priests of Amen-ra, about this time,
                    certainly not later than the rise of Dynasty XXII., retreated to Ethiopia, where
                    they founded a kingdom, of which the capital was Napata. The Pharaoh whose
                    daughter Solomon married was, if Manetho’s numbers are correct, Psusennes IL,
                    Har-Psiunkha, last king of Dynasty XXI. He seems to have endeavoured to restore
                    the military power of Egypt, for he made an expedition into Canaan and captured
                    the town of Gezer, which he gave to his daughter, Solomon’s queen.</p>
                <p>During the later period of the Empire, partly through marriages of the Pharaohs,
                    partly in consequence of the large employment of mercenaries, chiefly Libyans,
                    great settlements of foreigners, Asiatic as well as African, were established in
                    Egypt. So far from the Shemites being then disliked, a multitude of Semitic
                    words were introduced into Egyptian, and it even became the fashion to give a
                    Semitic form to native words (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 337,
                    338). A Shemite family, settled at Bubastis, or in the Bubastite <pb break="no"

                    by alliances with the Tanite family in establishing a new royal line, Dynasty
                    XXII., which is remarkable for its foreign names. The royal names Sheshonk,
                    Osorkon, Takelot are all either Assyrian or Babylonian. Still more striking is
                    the name Nemrut, or Nimrod, borne by non-kingly members of the family. Probably
                    it came from the further East.</p>
                <p>Sheshonk I., the Shishak of the Bible, may have gained the royal power peaceably.
                    His son Osorkon married the daughter of the last king of the Tanite Dynasty, to
                    whom Sheshonk succeeded. He seems early to have entertained the design of
                    restoring the Egyptian rule in the East, for he received Jeroboam when he fled
                    from Solomon. The revolt of the Ten Tribes enabled him to carry out this
                    project, and late in his reign he marched against Rehoboam, and returned with
                    the treasures of the Temple and the palace. A remarkable sculpture at the temple
                    of El-Karnak gives a list of 130 names of towns and peoples conquered by Shishak
                    in this expedition. Long as is the list, it is not like the rolls of the
                    conquerors of the Empire. The items are far less important, and the Hagarenes
                    recur several times, as if to record the subjugation of a series of small
                    Bedawee tribes. Cities of Judah and Israel appear in the list, but the towns in
                    the kingdom of Jeroboam seem to be Levite and Canaanite, and it is probable that
                    the Israelite king was not averse to their overthrow. With this occurrence we
                    gain the first good chronological footing in Egyptian history. The Hebrew
                    chronology is indeed not as yet fixed. The Assyrian monuments seem to indicate a
                    reduction of at least twenty-three years in the ordinary dates. The invasion of
                    Shishak is ordinarily dated <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 971, but may thus
                    have to be lowered to about u.c. 948; and as it probably took place in about the
                    twentieth year of the Egyptian king’s reign, his accession may be dated
                    approximately <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 967.</p>
                <p>The government of Egypt under the kings of Dynasty XXII. underwent an important
                    change. They made the high-priesthood of Amen-ra an office of a prince of the
                    family, usually the eldest son, and gave high governments to other princes. Thus
                    the power of the Pharaoh ultimately became merely nominal, and Egypt resolved
                    itself into an aggregate of principalities. A further cause of decay was the
                    importance of the Libyan mercenaries which each of the princes commanded. Under
                    a new dynasty, XXIII., said to be of Tanites, but probably kindred to the
                    Bubastitβ3, Egypt was, for a time at least, reunited under a single rule, but
                    towards its close the process of disintegration had already again set in, and
                    the country was divided among nearly twenty princes, at least four of whom took
                    the royal insiguia (Maspero, ∕f⅛i. <hi rend="italic">Anc.,</hi> 378 <hi
                    rend="italic">seqqj).</hi></p>
                <p>Among these small princes but one was capable of attempting to reunite Egypt
                    under his rule. This was Tafnekht, Tnephachthos, prince of Sais, who reduced
                    great part of the country, and would probably have achieved complete success,
                    had not the yet unconquered princes called in the priest-king of Napata, Piankhi
                    Meriamen. While Egypt bad declined, Ethiopia had constantly risen, and at this
                    time part of the Thebais owed it allegiance. Piankhi, the descendant of the
                    priest-kings of Thebes, was not unwilling to recover his ancient dominions. Tn
                    one brilliant campaign he defeated Tafnekht and his allies, captured their
                    strongholds, and obtained the sovereignty of Egypt, leaving the small princes to
                    rule as his vassals. The ancient Empire was thus in part restored, but as it was
                    ruled from Ethiopia, and the little princes constantly strove for independence,
                    it had no real durability. Piankhi was succeeded by Kashta, who was probably an
                    Ethiopian, owing his throne to his intermarriage with a princess of the Theban
                    line.</p>
                <p>Bokenranf, or Bocchoris, son and successor of Tafnekht, no doubt seizing this
                    occasion, was able to carry out the project of his father and make himself king
                    of Egypt. After a short reign marked by energy and prudence he perished in a
                    fresh Ethiopian invasion. . Shabak, or Sabakon, conquered Egypt, and having
                    taken Bokenranf in his capital, Sals, put him to a cruel death. It was no longer
                    an Egyptian prince who ruled atNapata; all the circumstances we know of Shabak
                    and his dynasty indicate an Ethiopian line, governing Egypt as a conquered
                    country, not as their ancient territory. Still Shabak’s connection with the
                    priestly line was not forgotten. His sister,Queen Ameniritis, governed Thebes,
                    and the power of the local rulers was limited, not destroyed. Hoshea, king of
                    Israel, sent presents to Shabak,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>"With this transaction Shabak’s record at El-Karnak of the

                    subsequently drawn into a confederacy of Syrian and other princes against Sargon
                    king of Assyria, but, as in all these wars, the Ethiopian king was a tardy ally.
                    His capital lay too far south, and in crossing the eastern border of Egypt he
                    left the ill-affected princes of the Delta in the line of his communications. He
                    therefore came into the field too late, and it was but little east of Egypt that
                    he met the Assyrians and experienced a disastrous defeat at Raphia. He lost
                    great part of Egypt, in which the small princes again established themselves,
                    now as vassals of Assyria, Shabak only retaining Ethiopia and part of Upper
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>Shabatok, or Sebichus, was the son and successor of Shabak. He made himself
                    supreme king in Egypt, but appears to have lost Ethiopia to Tahraka. Towards the
                    close of his reign the Egyptian dynasts joined in an alliance against
                    Sennacherib, who had recently succeeded Sargon. The confederates were defeated,
                    or made their submission one by one. The Egyptian princes lost a battle in
                    southern Palestine, in the territory of their ally Hezekiah, who was the last in
                    the East to submit. But the Egyptians again advanced, encouraged by Tahraka,
                    king of Ethiopia, who marched to their support. No battle was fought. The
                    Assyrians moved against the Egyptians, but in one night the invading army
                    perished,and Sennacherib fled to Nineveh. The tradition of the Egyptians agrees
                    with Biblical history in relating the destruction of the Assyrians as
                    miraculous; and it should be noted that for the rest of his reign Sennacherib
                    never ventured again to invade Palestine. During this interval of
                    respiteTahrakaenteredEgypt,slewShabatok, and made himself master of the whole
                    country <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 692).</p>
                <p>After twenty years of what seems to have been a peaceful reign, the Assyrian w ar
                    began afresh, Esarhaddon, son and successor of Sennacherib, resolving on the
                    subjugation of Egypt. Tahraka was vanquished and fled to Napata, and Memphis and
                    Thebes were taken. The country was divided between twenty princes, with Neku I.
                    of Sal's as their chief. The fortresses were garrisoned with Assyrian troops <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.672).</hi> Tn a few years, however,Tahraka returned,
                    defeated the Assyrians, and captured Memphis. In commemoration of the earlier
                    subjugation or of this one, the Ethiopian king puts the name of Egypt among
                    those of conquered nations not only at Napata but also at Thebes (Maspero, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Anc.,</hi> 427; Brυgsch, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 1
                    ed., 244, 245). Soon after Esarhaddon abdicated in favour of his son
                    Asshur-bani-pal, who speedily invaded and reconquered Egypt, driving out Tahraka
                    and restoring the tributary princes. As soon, however, as he had left, a
                    conspiracy broke out, and these chiefs sent emissaries to Tahraka. They w erc
                    overcome by the Assyrians, and Neku and two others sent in chains to Nineveh,
                    before Tahraka could come to their aid. But he again reconquered Thebes and
                    Memphis. Asshur-bani-pal now made a politic use of the Egyptian party, treated
                    Neku with honour, and sent him back to Egypt as ruler of Sals, giving a second
                    principality to his son Psametik. Neku returned to find that Tahraka <pb

                    666). Urdamen, Tahraka’s son-in-law and successor, held Upper Egypt, and at once
                    attacked the Assyrians, captured Memphis from them, and took Neku, whom he put
                    to death, while Psametik fled into Syria. Asshur-bani-pal now invaded Egypt,
                    defeated Urdamen, and sacked Thebes, carrying the whole population captive. The
                    twenty principalities were again set up, but Psametik was not the chief.</p>
                <p>After a time the Egyptian princes became independent of Assyria, but they had
                    once more to submit to au Ethiopian invader, Nouat-Meiamen, who reconquered the
                    country without much difficulty, but does not seem to have Ion» held it. The
                    Saite prince Psametik, whose ambition excited the jealousy of the other dynasts,
                    at last achieved the object for which his predecessors had pertinaciously
                    fought. By the aid of Carian and Ionian mercenaries lie put down his rivals, and
                    by a marriage with the niece of Shabak rendered his line legitimate. This
                    alliance with a princess only a generation younger than the first Ethiopian king
                    brings into striking relief the vicissitudes which Egypt underwent during the
                    Assyrian wars. Calamities were crowded into those years which usually occupy
                    centuries. Yet under the new king, who was the real founder of Dynasty XXVI.,
                    Egypt rapidly recovered, and during the rule of his successors it was for the
                    first time since the Empire strong and united, enjoying a true national
                    existence. Public works of all kinds were carried on with energy. Art, which had
                    fallen under the Bubastites and their followers, now suddenly revived, and with
                    its recovery the ideas of the primitive dynasties came into fashion. The style
                    of the age may be best compared with that of Dynasties IV. and V. It is,
                    however, wanting in vigour, using elongated forms and abundant details. Still it
                    has an elegance and a mastery of material which show that Egypt had not lost the
                    true feeling of its art, in spite of the disastrous wars which had threatened
                    the overthrow of all the institutions of the country.</p>
                <p>Psametik I., or Psammetichus, employed his long reign in strengthening Egypt and
                    in restoring the temples and making additional monuments. He recovered from
                    Ethiopia a part of Lower Nubia, and made a successful expedition into Philistia.
                    His designs of conquest were, however, frustrated by a wholesale desertion of
                    Egyptian troops, caused by jealousy of the Ionian and Carian mercenaries to whom
                    Psametik owed his throne. The mutineers, whose number IL·rodotus puts at 240,000
                    men, were too strong to be resisted, and deaf to the king’s intreaties marched
                    to Ethiopia and received lands from the king of that country. All that the
                    Egyptian sovereign could do was to form a new army and build a fleet. He thus
                    missed the opportunity afforded by the decline of Nineveh of winning back the
                    influence Egypt had long lost in the East. An interesting memorial of his reign
                    is the Greek inscription on one of the colossi of Aboosimbel, in Nubia,
                    recording the visit of mercenary and Egyptian troops.</p>
                <p>Neku <hi rend="smallcaps">II.,b.c.</hi> 611, son and successor of Psametik,
                    inherited his father’s energy but not his prudence. He attempted to complete an
                    enterprise of the Empire and connect the Red Sea with the Nile, and so with the
                    Mediterranean, by a canal. Under his orders Phoenician seamen circumnavigated
                    Africa. Less fortunate was his attempt to recover the eastern rule of Egypt. He
                    marched against Megiddo, still the key to the route to the Euphrates. Here he
                    was met by the forces of Josiah, king of Judah, with whom he unwillingly fought.
                    Josiah was slain, and the king of Egypt advanced to Carchemish on the Euphrates.
                    Thus the Egyptian Empire was for a moment restored. There was no great eastern
                    rival to contest its supremacy. Assyria had fallen, Babylon was not yet firmly
                    established. After about three years Nabopolassar, the king of Babylon, sent his
                    son Nebuchadnezzar against the Egyptians. At Carchemish the armies met. Neku was
                    defeated, and the Egyptian rule in the East finally destroyed. Soon after the
                    king of Egypt died, leaving his throne to his son Psametik IL, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 595, whose short reign was only marked by an
                    expedition against the king of Ethiopia. The next king, Psametik’s son, Uahabra,
                    or A pries, the Pharaoh Hophra of Scripture, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 590,
                    inherited the energy and ambition of the Saite house. His accession was the
                    signal for a general confederation of Palestine and Phoenicia against the king
                    of Babylon. The war was speedily ended by the capture of Jerusalem, which
                    Uahabra in vain endeavoured to prevent. He was, however, successful at sea. His
                    Greek ships beat the Phoenician fleet of Nebuchadnezzar, and for a time he held
                    the Phoenician coast, and aided Tyre in a resistance of thirteen years against
                    the Babylonian besiegers. A great disaster lost Uahabra his throne. He engaged
                    in a war with the Greeks of Cyrene. His Egyptian troops were defeated. The
                    native soldiers believed that he had planned their destruction that he might put
                    mercenaries in their place. They revolted and chose Aahmes, or Amasis, king.
                    Amasis defeated the mercenary troops of Uahabra and dethroned him, B.c, 571. It
                    is to this time that the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar is assigned by
                    Josephus. The silence of Herodotus and the other Greek historians, and the
                    prosperity of Egypt under Amasis, have induced modern scholars to suppose that
                    Josephus based his statement on the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. If,
                    however, we read between the lines of the story of Herodotus, we need some other
                    cause than the disaffection of the Egyptian troops to account for the sudden
                    success of Amasis, and especially for his easy defeat of the mercenaries with a
                    discouraged native force. Again, the conquests of Egypt by the Assyrians, though
                    predicted by Isaiah and noticed as past by Nahum, are unrecorded by Herodotus
                    and the Greeks. The prosperity of the country in the reign of Amasis might as
                    easily follow a Babylonian conquest as that under Psametik I. followed the
                    terrible Assyrian wars. The scantiness of the native records of Nebuchadnezzar’s
                    reign leaves us without Babylonian evidence.</p>
                <p>Amasis took to wife a grand-daughter of Psametik I. and his heiress-queen
                    Shapentap, thus legitimatizing his pretensions. He greatly embellished the
                    temples of Egypt. It may be that, as in the time of Psametik I., they needed
                    restoration. His foreign policy was marked by energy and caution. He transferred
                    the Ionian and Carian mercenaries to Memphis itself as a force of guards. He
                    granted the Greeks the free use of Naucratis as a Hellenic settlement and
                    trading port. He conquered Cyprus, and kept up the influence of Egypt in
                    Phoenicia. He had friendly relations with the Greek states, and instead of
                    conducting an expedition against the Babylonians during their Empire or against
                    the rapidly rising power of the Persians, he joined in an alliance of which
                    Croesus, king of Lydia, was the head, and agreed to furnish him with an Egyptian
                    contingent in his war with Cyrus. After the fall of Croesus other wars kept
                    Cyrus from any designs on Egypt, and it was not until the accession of his son
                    Cambyses that the Persians could attempt its reduction. Meanwhile Amasis died,
                    leaving the crown to his son Psametik III., the Psammenitus of Herodotus, who,
                    after a single well-fought battle near Pelusium, and the capture of Pelusium and
                    Memphis, lost his kingdom, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 525.</p>
                <p>Cambyses, as we learn from the narrative of the Egyptian priest Uta-har-sun of

                    vented his rage upon the monuments and objects of worship in Egypt. The Saite
                    priest, in general terms, describes this as a time of calamity such as had never
                    before befallen his country. Cambyses left Egypt, which was so completely
                    crushed that the subsequent usurpation of the Magian was marked by no revolt.
                    One of the first cares of Darius I. was to charge Uta-har-sun with the
                    restoration of the disordered country. In a visit to Egypt at the moment when a
                    revolt had broken out, he pacified the people by supporting their religion, in
                    the most marked contrast to Cambyses. For the rest of his reign he endeavoured
                    to promote the commercial welfare of Egypt, in particular opening the canal from
                    the Nile to the Red Sea. In the Great Oasis he built a temple to Ammon. It was
                    not until the very close of his reign that the Egyptians rose against his rule,
                    and expelled the Persians, choosing as king Khabbash, whose name has been
                    discovered in the Sarapeum. The revolt lasted but three years, and Xerxes I.
                    suppressed it with severity. Achaemenes, the brother of Xerxes, was made satrap.
                    Egypt did not again rise until the troubles which marked the accession of
                    Artaxerxes I. The insurrection was led by Tnaros, prince of Marea, who
                    immediately concluded an alliance with the Athenians. Supported by 200 Athenian
                    triremes, he defeated and slew the satrap Achaemenes, and besieged in the
                    citadel of Memphis the remnant of the Persian army, which, though it included
                    Egyptian soldiers, held out until the attacking force was drawn off by a fresh
                    Persian army. The Egyptians and their allies were now driven to the island of
                    Prosopitis, and there besieged for eighteen months. At last Inaros was taken and
                    put to death; Amyrtaeus, an Egyptian who reigned with him, fled to the marshes,
                    where he long maintained himself. Artaxerxes, after this serious revolt of six
                    years, modified the administration of Egypt, recognizing Thannyras, son of
                    Inaros, and Pausiris, of Amyrtaeus, as vassal kings. The government was,
                    however, held by a Persian satrap; these were merely local princes.</p>
                <p>An Amyrtaeus, probably son of Pausiris (Maspero, <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Anc.,</hi> 562), revolted, and on the death of Darius IL, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 404, made Egypt virtually independent. He is the one king of Dynasty
                    XXVIII., Saite. His successor, Naifaaurut I., founded Dynasty XXIX. of
                    Mendesians, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 399. With him the monuments, silent
                    since the rising of Khabbash, again give us information, and under the next
                    dynasty show that the Saite art still lived in spite of the misfortunes the
                    country had undergone. The Mendesians Naifaaurut and Hakor are chiefly known for
                    the part they took in aiding the enemies of Persia. Hakor was followed by
                    Naifaaurut IL, and then the sovereignty passed to Dynasty XXX. of Mendesians,
                    the last native Egyptian line. The first of these kings, Nekht-har-heb, or
                    Nectanebes I., came to the throne when a Persian invasion was imminent, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 378. Hakor had already formed a powerful army,
                    largely composed of Greek mercenaries. This army Nekht-har-heb intrusted to the
                    Athenian Chabrias. The Persians, however, succeeded in causing his recall and in
                    gaining the services of his fellow-countryman Iphicrates. The invading army
                    consisted of 200,000 barbarians under Pharnabazus and 20,000 Greeks under
                    Iphicrates. After the Egyptians had experienced a reverse, Iphicrates counselled
                    an immediate advance on Memphis. His advice was not followed by Pharnabazus; the
                    Egyptian king collected his forces and won a pitched battle near Mendes.
                    Pharnabazus retreated, and Egypt was free.</p>
                <p>Nekht-har-heb was succeeded by Tachos or Teos, whose short reign was occupied by
                    a war with Persia, in which the king of Egypt secured the services of a body of
                    Greek mercenaries under the Spartan king Agesilaus and a fleet under the
                    Athenian general Chabrias. He entered Phoenicia with every prospect of success·
                    but having offended Agesilaus, he was dethroned in a military revolt which gave
                    the crown to Nekht-nebf, or Nectanebes IL, the last native king of Egypt. At
                    this moment a revolt broke out. The prince of Mendes almost succeeded in
                    overthrowing the new king. Agesilaus defeated the rival pretender, and left
                    Nekht-nebf established on the throne. But the opportunity of a decisive blow
                    against Persia was lost. The new king, Artaxerxes III. Ochus, determined to
                    reduce Egypt. A first expedition was defeated by the Greek mercenaries of
                    Nekht-nebf, but a second, commanded by Ocbus himself, subdued Egypt with no
                    further resistance than that of the Greek garrison of Pelusium. Nekht-nebf,
                    instead of endeavouring to relieve them, retreated to Memphis and fled thence to
                    Ethiopia, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 3401 Thus miserably fell the monarchy
                    of the Pharaohs after an unexampled duration of nearly 3000 years, or as some
                    think far longer. More than 2000 years have since passed, and though Egypt has
                    from time to time been independent, not one native prince has sat on the throne
                    of the Pharaohs. “There shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt” (Ezek.
                    XXX. 13) was prophesied in the days of Apries as the final state of the
                    land.</p>
                <p>The causes of the downfall of Egypt are sufficiently evident in the previous
                    history. The weakness of the later Thebans fostered divisions. The Bubastites
                    aided the natural tendency of the country to break up into small principalities.
                    The Ethiopians, while they brought a new force to resist the Assyrians,
                    increased the divisions of Egypt, which had to choose to which of two foreign
                    empires it would submit. The Saltes restored nationality, but they maintained it
                    at the cost of alienating the native troops, and thus could not effectually
                    resist Persia. Although their gallant struggles brought out the fighting
                    qualities of the Egyptians, these Pharaohs could never venture on a great λvar
                    without Greek mercenaries. Hence constant discontent and an inharmonious
                    military system. At length the native energy was worn out.</p>
                <p>The barbarian Ochu3 used his success mercilessly, rivalling the worst acts of
                    Cambyses. Under him and his successors Egypt made no movement, and when
                    Alexander entered the country as the conqueror of Persia he was welcomed as a
                    deliverer. The Persian governor had not forces enough to oppose him, and he
                    experienced nowhere even the show of resistance. He visited Memphis, founded
                    Alexandria, and went on pilgrimage to the oracle of Jupiter Ammon. He then
                    organized the government under two officers, who from their names appear to have
                    been a Greek and an Egyptian. He left the Egyptians satisfied with his reverence
                    for their religion, and for the rest of his reign the country remained a
                    peaceful province of his great empire. With Alexander, the Macedonian dominion
                    began. It lasted for 302 years, after the Empire the brightest period of
                    Egyptian history, during the whole of which no general native revolt broke out.
                    From this time the Egyptian local princes, who for five centuries, except only
                    during the rule of Psametik and his house, had caused all the divisions of
                    Egypt, disappear from the scene. This final settlement was probably due to the
                    policy of Alexander, under whose successors we see the real government of the
                    country, with its centre in the Greek city he had founded, and the control of
                    the army and navy, intrusted to Greeks; whereas the native religion was
                    protected, but wholly left to the Egyptian priests, except so far as the king
                    himself acted as one of the priesthood. Thus the foreigners had all the true
                    power, while the natives were satisfied with a semblance of it, and the local
                    importance this semblance gave to their functionaries. Routes of trade were
                    actively pushed, and works of public benefit carried out, and the Egyptians grew
                    more and more <pb break="no"

                    rarely seen, and the king only appeared in the character of a Pharaoh to show
                    respect to the religion of the country. The learned men of both races drew
                    nearer together, and Greek speculation had its effect on Egyptian thought. The
                    less cultivated settlers were attracted by the native superstitions, and at last
                    the Alexandrian was far more an Egyptian than even a Macedonian.</p>
                <p>On the division of Alexander’s dominions, Egypt fell to the share of Ptolemy, son
                    of Lagus and Arsinoë, a concubine of Philip’s, whose son he was supposed to have
                    been. Of all Alexander’s generals he was the most far-sighted. Instead of aiming
                    at the rule of the empire, he secured the least exposed province and employed
                    its resources rather for defence than offence. One of his first acts was to
                    divert the burial of Alexander from Macedon to Egypt. The body was taken to
                    Memphis, but under Ptolemy’s successor it was removed to Alexandria, so that the
                    conqueror rested in the city he had founded. His first conquest was the
                    Cyrenaica <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 322), a valuable province outside the
                    field of the contests of his rivals, yet greatly useful for naval enterprises
                    against them. Yet he did not declare himself independent; as a subject of the
                    phantom kings Philip Aridaeus and Alexander Aegus, he inscribed their names in
                    his restorations of Egyptian temples, and alone of all the generals struck money
                    in the name of Aegus so long as that last heir of Alexander lived. He was not
                    long left in undisturbed occupation of his government. The regent Perdiccas,
                    finding that Ptolemy was engaged in a league against his authority, marched into
                    Egypt, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 321; but the resistance of Ptolemy and a
                    mutiny in the invader’s army, which resulted in his death, delivered Egypt from
                    this danger. The succeeding years were occupied in attempts to add Coele-Syria
                    and Phoenicia to the Egyptian dominions, which can scarcely be considered rash
                    when we remember the importance of these provinces to the security of Egypt
                    against invasion, and for winning of the maritime supremacy of the eastern
                    Mediterranean. During this time Cyprus was made a dependency, and the Cyrenaica,
                    which had revolted, was finally reduced by Ptolemy’s step-son Magas. A great
                    calamity now arrested the growing power of Egypt, when Demetrius, son of
                    Antigonus, defeated Ptolemy in a sea-fight off Salamis of Cyprus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 306). Antigonus then assumed the royal diadem, and
                    Ptolemy followed his example. Antigonus and Demetrius immediately attacked
                    Egypt, but without success; and Ptolemy, rapidly recovering his strength, aided
                    the Rhodians when besieged by Demetrius <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 305-4).
                    It is related that when the siege was raised the Rhodians gave Ptolemy, as their
                    “preserver,” the title of <hi rend="italic">‰τ-ηp.</hi> This appears in his
                    hieroglyphic inscriptions as his distinctive title, and upon the coins of his
                    successors struck in his name in Phoenicia. After this Ptolemy again attempted
                    without success the conquest of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, but ultimately seized
                    and held Cyprus, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 295, which thus became a part of
                    the Egyptian monarchy for nearly its whole duration. His later years were passed
                    in consolidating his power. Seleucus was master of a Syrian empire, too firmly
                    ruled to be attacked with any chance of success, and stretching too far
                    eastwards to make its master aggressive on the Egyptian border. The government
                    of Egypt was assured by the care taken to maintain and increase the Greek
                    element in the country. Alexandria was made a seat of Hellenic culture, and if
                    it is not absolutely certain that Ptolemy founded the Library and the Museum, he
                    undoubtedly gathered the necessary intellectual materials. The great Greek
                    colony of Ptolemais, in the Thebais, was established. Thus the native and
                    foreign elements were kept apart, conflicts avoided, and strong Hellenic centres
                    secured. The Egyptians were flattered by the arrival of the image of Sarapis
                    from Sinope and the spread over Egypt, under the king’s influence, of a Hellenic
                    form of their religion. The king’s portrait on his coins shows us him in old
                    age, and is distinguished by resolution, keenness, and craft.</p>
                <p>Having ruled thirty-eight years, the old king abdicated in favour of his young
                    son Philadelphus, chosen to the prejudice of his elder brothers <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 285), and died two years later <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(b.c.</hi> 283).</p>
                <p>Ptolemy Philadelphus rιded for thirty-eight years of almost undisturbed peace.
                    His half-brother Magas, probably soon after the death of Ptolemy Soter, declared
                    himself king in Cyrenaica, and attempted to invade Egypt. Ptolemy remained on
                    the defensive, and at last a treaty was signed by which Ptolemy, heir of the
                    Egyptian crown, and Berenice, heiress of Cyrenaica, were betrothed, Magas
                    retaining the power if not the name of king. Philadelphus was also fortunate in
                    recovering Phoenicia and Coele-Syria. This probably took place not much before
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 266, for that is the earliest date in the series
                    of coins struck at Tyre during his reign. He secured the friendship of the
                    Phoenician and Palestinian coast-towns, by granting them a degree of autonomy,
                    for their coins, though dated in his reign, were struck at each town, and bear
                    not his name but that of his father. In Egypt lie paid great attention to the
                    extension of commerce. He reopened the canal of the Red Sea and established a
                    desert route from Coptos to Berenice on the coast which he had founded. He made
                    war in Ethiopia, but according to his custom he was content to be on friendly
                    terms with the Ethiopian king Ergamenes. His Ethiopian expedition led to his
                    establishing a station for the purpose of securing a supply of elephants for
                    war. An ambassador was sent to India. Thus the trade of Ethiopia, Arabia, and
                    India was secured for Egypt, and continued to enrich it for eighteen centuries.
                    Not Jess wisely Philadelphus made Alexandria, with the Museum and Library, the
                    heart of the learning of Greece. Many cities were founded by him, or like
                    Ptolémaïs in Galilee, refounded. In his long reign there was little expenditure
                    but such as was calculated to enrich his empire. At his death his dominions
                    equalled those of his father. He held Cyprus, much of the coast of Asia Minor,
                    the Cyclades, and part of Ethiopia and Arabia. The Cyrenaica was only to be
                    separated for the life of Magas. He twice married. His second wife was Arsiuoë
                    II., his full sister, whom he married in accordance with Egyptian rather than
                    Greek notions. She was a woman of great beauty and force of character, and much
                    loved by her husband. The character of Philadelphus is marked by the craft
                    rather than the force of his father’s; but he inherited to the full his love of
                    literature and his love of pleasure, both undisturbed by warlike ambition. He is
                    the last representative of the old Greek “tyrannos,” whom Pindar has made known
                    to us, rather than one of the restless “diadochoi.”</p>
                <p>Ptolemy Euergetes, son of Philadelphus and Arsinoë I., by his accession, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 247, reunited the Cyrenaica to the Egyptian empire. A
                    quarrel between Egypt and Syria immediately broke out. The Syrian king Antiochus
                    II. had married a daughter of Philadelphus. She was now put away, and, as well
                    as Antiochus, murdered by her rival, his first wife Laodice, who set up her son
                    Seleucus II. Ptolemy invaded Syria, which he speedily subdued, and then
                    following the traditions of Egyptian conquest, he passed the Euphrates and
                    reduced the whole of the eastern dominions of Seleucus. He returned to Egypt
                    with vast treasures, including the statues of the gods which Cambyses had
                    carried away, and which he restored to the temples. At sea he was equally
                    fortunate, and the maritime territories of Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean

                    Thracian coast to Ethiopia, from Cyrene to the border of India. The eastern
                    provinces speedily returned to the Syrian rule, and Ptolemy was content with a
                    moderate accession of territory on that side. He, however, retained his Greek
                    conquests and pushed far south in Abyssinia. Euergetes was not merely a warlike
                    king. He cared for literature, and more than his predecessors laboured to please
                    the Egyptians. He is the first Ptolemy whose Egyptian structures are worthy of
                    the wealth of the country. Art had lost its ancient delicacy, yet the sumptuous
                    architecture of this age merits admiration as showing a new though somewhat
                    false development of the ancient style. His reform of the native calendar, as
                    recorded in the Decree of Canopus, is another mark of his wise interest in
                    Egypt. He was fortunate in his marriage with Berenice IL, who as queen of Cyrene
                    is the first Egyptian queen who has the same regal style as her husband. Having
                    reigned twenty-five years he left his kingdom to his son.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy Philopator, who began to reign <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 222,
                    immediately on his accession put his mother Berenice and others of his nearest
                    kindred to death, and, leaving the management of the state to Sosibius,
                    abandoned himself to luxury. Antiochus III., king of Syria, seized the
                    opportunity to wrest from Egypt all the eastern provinces. Ptolemy at length
                    took the field himself in defence of Egypt, and defeated Antiochus at Raphia,
                    where his success was greatly due to the courage of Arsinoë III., his sister and
                    wife <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 217). By this victory Coele-Syria and
                    Phoenicia were recovered. Ptolemy returned to his former life, and Arsinoë was
                    put to death. He left his kingdom, greatly weakened by bad administration and
                    growing disaffection, to a child, Ptolemy Epiphanes. The other two Macedonian
                    kings, Philip V. and Antiochus III., now allied themselves to despoil Egypt of
                    the provinces. Everything but Cyprus and Cyrene was taken, and the Egyptian
                    ministers only saved the country by having called in the aid of Rome. The
                    Republic had long been friendly to the Ptolemies, and nothing suited her policy
                    better than a protectorate of Egypt. Accordingly M. Aemilius Lepidus was sont as
                    regent to Alexandria, and Antiochus was commanded to restore what he had
                    conquered. It was finally settled that Ptolemy should marry Cleopatra, daughter
                    of the Syrian king, and that she should take back Coele-Syria and Phoenicia.
                    From this time Rome ruled Egypt with reference to her own eastern policy. The
                    kingdom of the Ptolemies was not allowed to fall, but it was kept within the
                    most moderate limits. Consequently the weak kings were supported and the strong
                    kings thwarted in every way. Egypt could not rid herself of a bad ruler or enjoy
                    the full advantage of a good one. The rest of the minority of Ptolemy was marked
                    by a serious revolt in Lower Egypt, put down with great difficulty. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 196, when but thirteen or fourteen years old, the
                    young king was crowned at Memphis, when the decree of the Rosetta Stone was
                    issued. The place of coronation and the terms of the decree show a policy of
                    conciliation towards the Egyptians which the revolt probably rendered especially
                    necessary. The marriage of Ptolemy and Cleopatra I. took place <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 193-2, but the dowry was not handed over. Ptolemy
                    continued true to the Romans in their war with Antiochus, but was not allowed to
                    act as their ally, and gained nothing in the subsequent treaty. Another revolt
                    broke out in Lower Egypt, and was cruelly suppressed, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 185. Ptolemy perished by poison in <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    181, leaving two sons surnamed Philometor and Euergetes, who ruled Egypt in
                    succession. Epiphanes inherited the weakness and cruelty of his father, and with
                    him Egypt lost for a time her influence in the affairs of the world.</p>
                <p>Cleopatra I., who like Berenice II. was queen as heiress, now became regent for
                    Ptolemy Philometor, and ruled well until her death, about <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 174. The ministers then made war on Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes) for the
                    disputed provinces. The Egyptian forces were defeated, Egypt invaded, and
                    Ptolemy seized <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 170). His younger brother,
                    Euergetes IL, with an audacious courage that marks his whole career, declared
                    himself king at Alexandria, where Antiochus besieged him in vain, and Roman
                    ambassadors interfered for his protection. Antiochus retired, leaving Philometor
                    as king at Memphis. The two brothers now made terms, agreeing to a joint rule.
                    Antiochus again invaded Egypt, and inarched to Alexandria, but was forced to
                    retire by the resolution of a Roman ambassador, M. Popillius Laenas <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 168). From this time Egypt was more than ever in the
                    hands of the Romans, and in consequence of the manner in which Philometor had
                    yielded to Antiochus while Euergetes had resisted his pretensions and depended
                    on their support, we find them constantly aiding Euergetes, whose abilities, if
                    equal to those of Philometor, were weighted by a perfidious and cruel
                    disposition. It was not long before Euergetes succeeded in driving Philometor
                    from Alexandria. The fugitive went to Rome <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 164,
                    and the senate agreed to reinstate him. Euergetes was spared by his brother, and
                    the Roman deputies obtained for him the kingdom of Cyrene, where he occupied
                    himself in ceaseless plots to obtain Cyprus, assisted by the active support of
                    Demetrius I. of Syria and the unjust diplomatic aid of the Roman senate.
                    Philometor had the courage to oppose his brother, who invaded Cyprus with Roman
                    ambassadors ordered to settle him in the government of the island. Philometor
                    defeated and took him prisoner, but again spared his life, and left him the
                    kingdom of Cyrene <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 154). The Romans did not
                    interfere with this settlement.</p>
                <p>The part Demetrius I. had played in the war in Cyprus led Philometor to take the
                    side of the usurper Alexander I. (Balas), to whom he gave his daughter Cleopatra
                    to wife <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 150). When Demetrius II. endeavoured to
                    recover his father’s kingdom Ptolemy advanced to the support of Alexander, but
                    thinking him treacherous, he turned his arms to the aid of the legitimate king.
                    Rapidly subduing the country, Ptolemy entered Antioch and was hailed king of
                    Syria, to the crown of which he had a claim as descended maternally from the
                    Seleucid line; but he admitted the higher right of Demetrius, whom he aided in
                    resisting an invasion by Alexander. In a decisive victory Ptolemy was thrown by
                    his horse and mortally injured <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 146).</p>
                <p>It was in the reign of Philometor that Onias founded the temple at Onion in
                    Egypt, which tended to increase the importance of the Jewish colonies and to
                    separate the Alexandrian from the Palestinian school.</p>
                <p>With this king the power of Egypt finally fell. He was the last Ptolemy who had
                    the capacity to rule amidst the growing difficulties of the time. In his wars he
                    showed courage and generalship, in his dealings with Rome caution and decision,
                    in his rejection of the Seleucid diadem moderation and justice, in his treatment
                    of his brother and his subjects an extraordinary clemency and humanity.</p>

                    >b.c.</hi> 127, and for the rest of his reign adopted a more conciliatory
                    policy. He engaged in war against Demetrius IL, and supported the usurper
                    Alexander IL, against whom he subsequently turned, apparently with reason. The
                    reconciliation with the Seleucids led to the recall of Cleopatra IL, with whom
                    Ptolemy now reigned. He died <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 117, in the
                    fifty-fourth year from his first accession. This king, the worst of the
                    Ptolemies, as Philometor was the best, is significantly known by the nickname
                    Physcon, or Fat-paunch, but he was also called by his subjects the Ill-doer,
                    Kakergetes, instead of the Welldoer, Euergetes. Some of his latest coins
                    present, instead of the idealized head of Ptolemy, the founder of the line,
                    bloated and cruel features which can only be those of Physcon. His one good
                    quality was a hereditary love of letters.</p>
                <p>Cleopatra III., surnamed Cocce, widow of Euergetes and heiress of Philometor,
                    succeeded, and, in deference to the popular will of the Alexandrians, associated
                    with her Ptolemy Soter IL, surnamed Lathyrus, or Lathurus, her elder son,
                    instead of Ptolemy Alexander I., the younger, whom she preferred. They ruled
                    together with little concord, and at length Cleopatra expelled her colleague,
                    who had been the real sovereign, and recalled Alexander from Cyprus, where he
                    had already ruled independently for seven years <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi>
                    107). Cyrene was probably lost to Egypt about this time. Physcon had left this
                    kingdom to his base son Ptolemy Apion, w ho is generally supposed to have at
                    once succeeded. The coins, however, show that the latest Cyrenalc coinage of
                    Physcon was continued by Lathyrus. Cleopatra III. now ruled with a stronger
                    authority, but by degrees Alexander gained the upper hand, and ultimately
                    dissensions arose which ended by his causing her death <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(b.c.</hi> 89): this occasioned troubles which lost him his throne, and brought
                    about the recall of his brother <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 89). During the
                    interval Lathyrus had ruled i∩ Cyprus, and both brothers had engaged on opposite
                    sides in the wars of the Seleucid princes. As king of Egypt, Lathyrus had to
                    subdue a native revolt, the first we know to have happened in Upper Egypt in the
                    time of the Ptolemies. Thebes seems to have been its centre, and here the
                    insurgents stood a siege of nearly three years, when the city was taken and
                    reduced to the ruined state from which it has never since risen. Lathyrus died
                    in <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 81. He appears to have been weak and cruel,
                    with some qualities as a politician and general. He left one legitimate child, a
                    daughter, Berenice III., who succeeded him. Her step-son, Alexander IL, son of
                    Alexander I., came from Rome as Sulla’s candidate, and married her. The nuptials
                    were almost immediately followed by the murder of the queen by her husband’s
                    order, and his deserved death in a popular tumult which was thus excited <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 80). In default of legitimate issue, two base sons
                    of Lathyrus now shared the Egyptian dominions, the elder, Ptolemy Neus Dionysus,
                    surnamed Auletes, the Flute-player, taking Egypt, and bis younger brother
                    Ptolemy acquiring Cyprus. Auletes inherited the vices without the ability of
                    Physcon, and having spent great sums in obtaining the recognition of the senate,
                    who probably would not readily part with the claim based on the legacy which
                    either Alexander I. or II. had made of his kingdom to the Romans, he wearied the
                    patience of his subjects by heavy taxation, and was expelled by the Alexandrians
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 58. His wife Cleopatra V. and daughter Berenice
                    IV. now reigned together, but, on the death of the elder, the younger became
                    sole queen. Berenice was twice married, first to Seleucus, a pretended Seleucid,
                    whom she put to death, and then to Archelaus. With the support of Gabinius,
                    proconsul of Syria, Auletes at length recovered Egypt, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 55. He punished his daughter with death, and in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 51 his troubled reign came to an end. At this time his family
                    consisted of two sons and two daughters,—the famous Cleopatra and Arsinoë, all
                    of whom in turn exercised regal power, three in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy, the elder son of Auletes, and Cleopatra VI., his elder daughter,
                    succeeded in accordance with their father’s will, which the Roman senate
                    ratified. In <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 48 her brother expelled Cleopatra,
                    who fled into Syria. Advancing to conquer Egypt by force of arms, she was met by
                    her brother’s forces near Pelusium. Here it was that Pompey, after the ruin of
                    his cause, was assassinated by order of Ptolemy’s ministers as he sought the
                    king’s protection. Caesar, following Pompey, reached Alexandria, Here Cleopatra,
                    giving up her ideas of war, made her way to Caesar and secured his interest.
                    After a struggle with the Egyptian ministers, who almost succeeded in
                    overpowering Caesar’s small forces, and who ultimately had the support of young
                    Ptolemy, who escaped from the Romans, the Egyptians were defeated and the king
                    drowned <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 47). Cleopatra now became queen,
                    associated with a phantom king, the younger Ptolemy. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 45 she went to Rome with her brother and young Ptolemy Caesar, her
                    son by the dictator, wishing to be acknowledged Caesar’s wife, and that the boy
                    should be made his heir. Next year Caesar was murdered, but by his will his
                    nephew Octavius became his heir, Cleopatra’s son, his only surviving child,
                    being necessarily set aside. The queen determined to secure for her sen Egypt at
                    least, and made away with her unfortunate brother. She nextappears when, after
                    the battle of Philippi, the triumvir Antony made his progress through Asia
                    Minor. It was necessary that the queen of Egypt should conciliate the ruler of
                    the Eastern world. Cleopatra resolved to govern him. As Caesar seven years
                    before, Antony now was instantly captivated by the Egyptian queen. She was past
                    thirty, but if her beauty had waned her wit had grown. Her portrait on her coins
                    is that of a woman of intellect and charm, not of beauty. A broad head with wavy
                    hair, an aquiline nose, large deep-set eyes, and a full eloquent mouth, is
                    supported by a long slender throat. To these personal qualities she added a mind
                    singularly cultivated, ready discourse in several languages, and, what that so
                    often lacks, as ready wit. She took Antony to Alexandria and governed the East
                    for him. While her power waxed his waned. Asia Minor was overrun by Q. Labienus
                    at the head of a Parthian army, and Palestine and Phoenicia by another led by
                    Pacorus, the Parthian king’s son. In Italy Antony’s adherents were routed. He
                    now resolved to attack Italy itself, and a great war was only averted by the
                    armies, which forced the generals to conclude a peace <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(b.c.</hi> 40). Octavia, his rival’s sister, was given in marriage to Antony,
                    and for three years Cleopatra lost her power. In <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    36 Antony deserted Octavia and returned to Alexandria and the Egyptian queen.
                    With the exception of an unsuccessful Parthian campaign and an inglorious
                    Armenian one, Antony effected nothing. He was amused by the luxurious life of
                    Alexandria; and, while Cleopatra maintained her Egyptian rights and ruled with
                    Ptolemy Caesar, she shared Antony’s government of the East, appearing as queen
                    with him as triumvir upon the coins of Antioch. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> 32 Octavian declared war against Cleopatra, and Antony took his
                    revenge by divorcing Octavia. Then followed the conflict in the Adriatic for the
                    world’s empire, in which Antony’s old military skill failed him, and Cleopatra,
                    leaving the battle, perhaps through a woman’s fear, drew him away also <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 31). Arrived at Alexandria, Cleopatra showed more
                    energy than Antony, and, when Octavian reached <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0771-0748"/> Egypt, more policy. Antony, on the false news of
                    the queen’s death, stabbed himself; and Cleopatra, finding Octavian resolved to
                    make her walk in his triumph, perished by her own hands in some unknown way.
                    Thus Egypt became a Roman province, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 30. The young
                    Ptolemy Caesar, in spite of his double claim, perished by the command of
                    Octavian, but the beautiful Cleopatra, Antony’s daughter by the queen, was
                    generously taken by his divorced wife Octavia, brought up with her own children,
                    and married to a king, Juba II. of Mauretania. With their son Ptolemy, whom
                    Caligula put to death <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 40, this great line came to
                    an end. Its genius ended with Cleopatra. The dislike of the Romans for her has
                    tended to give the moderns too low an estimate of her abilities. When we see
                    what Egypt was under Auletes and under her we are astonished to perceive how
                    much she accomplished by her management of Caesar and of Antony. After all the
                    other independent states had been absorbed by Rome, Egypt was raised from a mere
                    protected province to be once more a kingdom, and at last Alexandria became
                    again a seat of empire. But the task Cleopatra set herself was beyond
                    accomplishment; the more she turned Antony into an imperial ruler the less could
                    he control the Roman armies by which he governed. Thus the fabric she had raised
                    was rotten at the base, and with her fall it disappeared.</p>
                <p>The history of Egypt under the Homans being that of a province, and the most
                    interesting events matters of ecclesiastical history, may here be told very
                    briefly. Worn out by the cruelty and avarice of a succession of bad rulers, the
                    country must have welcomed the Romans almost as it had welcomed Alexander, and
                    so soon as it was known that the native religion would be protected, all
                    discontent must have vanished. The temples were still the care of the nιlers.
                    Art had indeed fallen very low, yet it continued to produce buildings with a
                    certain rich grandeur, that did not begin to give place to Graeco-Roman
                    structures till the time of Hadrian and the Antonines.</p>
                <p>Aelius Gallus, prefect of Egypt under Augustus, was ambitious to enlarge the
                    province by foreign conquest. He failed in an expedition into Arabia Felix, but
                    repelled an Ethiopian invasion, and in return penetrated as far as Napata, the
                    capital of Queen Candace, which he captured. In later reigns the chief events
                    were troubles connected with the Jewish population. In the time of Vespasian,
                    the temple Onias had founded was closed, and a great J ewish revolt in the reign
                    of Trajan, which was not easily suppressed, cost the Jews the privileges which,
                    in common with the Greek population, they had enjoyed above the native
                    inhabitants. Hadrian twice visited Egypt <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi>
                    130,134). He renewed the old privileges and granted new ones. The foundation of
                    Antinoë shows how low the nation had then fallen. Under Antoninus Pius, a
                    Sothiac Cycle began <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 139). In the next reign,
                    Avidius Cassius, prefect of Egypt, having suppressed a serious revolt, usurped
                    the purple, and was acknowledged by the armies of Syria and Egypt. On the
                    approach of Marcus Aurelius, the adherents of Cassius slew him, and the clemency
                    of the emperor restored peace. After the downfall of the house of the Antonines,
                    Pescennius Niger, who commanded the forces in Egypt, was proclaimed emperor on
                    the death of Pertinax <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 193). Severus overthrew
                    his rival <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 194), and, the revolt having been a
                    military one, did not punish the province, but gave great privileges to the
                    Alexandrians. In his reign the Christians of Egypt suffered the first of their
                    many persecutions. λVhen Christianity was planted in the country we do not know,
                    but it must very early have gained adherents among the learned Jews of
                    Alexandria, whose school of thought was in some respects ready to welcome it.
                    From them it rapidly passed to the Greeks. Ultimately, the new religion spread
                    to the Egyptians; their own creed was worn out, and they found in Christianity a
                    doctrine of the future life, for which their old belief had made them not
                    unready; while the social teaching of Christianity came with special fitness to
                    a subject race. The history of the Coptic Version has yet to be written. It
                    presents some features of great antiquity, and, unlike all others, has the truly
                    popular character of being written in the three dialects of the language. Side
                    by side there grew up an Alexandrian Church, philosophic, disputative,
                    ambitious, the very centre of Christian learning, and an Egyptian Church,
                    ascetic, contemplative, mystical. The two at length influenced one another;
                    still we can generally trace the philosophic teachers to a Greek origin, the
                    mystics to an Egyptian.</p>
                <p>Caracalla, in revenge for an affront, massacred the population of Alexandria.
                    Under Decius the Christians again sufΓered from persecution. When the Empire
                    broke up in the weak reign of Gallienus, Aemilianus was made emperor by the
                    troops at Alexandria; but, after a short and vigorous reign, was conquered by
                    the forces of Gallienus. Zenobia, queen of Palmyra, after an unsuccessful
                    invasion, on a second attempt conquered Egypt, which she added to her empire,
                    but lost it when Aurelian made war upon her <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi>
                    272). The province was, however, unsettled, and the conquest of Palmyra was
                    followed in the same year by the suppression of a revolt in Egypt <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 273). Probus, who“had governed Egypt for Aurelian
                    and Tacitus, was subsequently chosen by the troops to succeed Tacitus, and is
                    the first governor of this province who obtained the whole of the Empire. The
                    country, however, was still disturbed, ändernder the reign of Diocletian, in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 292, a formidable revolt had broken out, led by
                    Achilleus, who as emperor took the name Domitius Domitianus. Diocletian, finding
                    his troops unable to determine the struggle, came to Egypt and reduced the
                    strongholds of the country. After he had left, Domitianus again raised his
                    standard and captured Alexandria, but Diocletian returning to Egypt took the
                    city and put his rival to death <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 297). This
                    revolt has very distinctly the character of a native rising, for it was not
                    localized in Alexandria, but spread over the country.</p>
                <p>The reign of Diocletian is the turning-point in the history of the Egyptian
                    Church. The edict of <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 303 against the Christians,
                    and those which succeeded it, were rigorously carried out in Egypt, where
                    Paganism was still strong, and face to face with a strong and united church.
                    Galerius, who succeeded Diocletian in the government of the East, implacably
                    pursued his policy, and this great persecution did not end until the persecutor,
                    perishing, it is said, of the dire malady of Herod and Philip II. of Spain, sent
                    out an edict of toleration <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 311). The Copts date
                    from the accession of Diocletian <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.u.</hi> 284), which
                    they call the Era of Diocletian or of the Martyrs.</p>
                <p>By the Edict of Milan <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 313), Constantine, with the
                    agreement of his colleague Licinius, acknowledged Christianity as having at
                    least equal rights with other religions, and when he gained sole power he wrote
                    to all his subjects advising them, like him, to become Christians <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 324). The Egyptian Church, hitherto free from
                    schism, was now divided by a fierce controversy, in which we see two Greek
                    parties, rather than a Greek and an Egyptian, in conflict. The Council of Nicaea
                    was called together (A.υ. 325) to determine between the orthodox and the party
                    of the Alexandrian presbyter Arius. At that council the native Egyptian bishops
                    were chiefly remarkable for their manly protest against enforcing celibacy on
                    the clergy. The most conspicuous controversialist on the orthodox side was the
                    young Alexandrian deacon, Athanasius, who returned home to be made archbishop of
                    Alexandria <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 326). For the long period during
                    which he presided over the Church of Egypt, his history is that of the struggle
                    of the two parties. Four times expelled by the Arians, and once by the emperor
                    Julian, he employed each banishment for work in the cause to which he was
                    devoted, and on each restoration he used his success with a moderation in marked
                    contrast to the persecuting policy of his enemies. His name and person were at
                    last known to the whole empire, which unconsciously recognized in him an
                    ecclesiastical ruler of Christendom, rather than the chief prelate of a
                    province. He was more a man of action than of thought, more an administrator
                    than a student, but his intrepid patience, his moderation, and his indomitable
                    energy, all directed to the welfare of the church and to no personal ends, gave
                    him an influence never afterwards obtained without the support of avast
                    ecclesiastical machinery. His is the latest character which was formed upon the
                    model of St Paul’s, and the most remarkable of his age. He died <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 373, at the momentwhenan Arian persecution began. The
                    reign of Theodosius I. witnessed the overthrow of Arianism, which was followed
                    by the suppression of Paganism, against which a final ediet was promulgated A.D.
                    390. In Egypt, the year before, the temple of Sarapis at Alexandria had been
                    destroyed, and to the same period we must assign the beginning of a partial
                    destruction of those Egyptian temples which had escaped the Persian conquerors.
                    Generally the Coptic Christians were content to build their churches within the
                    ancient temples, plastering over or effacing the sculptures which were nearest
                    to the ground and in the way of the worshippers. They do not seem to have been
                    very zealous in the work of destruction. The native religion was already dead
                    and they had no fear of it. The prosperity of the church was the sign of its
                    decay, and before long we find persecution and injustice disgracing the scat of
                    Athanasius. Cyril the patriarch of Alexandria expelled the Jews from the capital
                    with the aid of the mob, and by the murder of the beautiful philosopher Hypatia
                    marked the lowest depth to which ignorant fanaticism could descend. A schism now
                    produced lengthened βivil war, and alienated Egypt from the empire. The
                    Monophysites, after a struggle of two centuries and a half, became utterly
                    hostile to the Greek rule. It was in these circumstances that a country which,
                    remote from the great conflicts that destroyed the Western Empire and threatened
                    the existence of the Eastern, had enjoyed uninterrupted freedom from an invader
                    since its conquest by Zenobia, and had known no rebellion since that of
                    Achilleus, fell without a <pb break="no"

                    throughout his dominions. Yet that he secretly favoured him is proved by his
                    vain attempt to escape to Egypt from the tyranny of his warlike brother. Ahmad
                    founded the dynasty of the Benee-Tooloon, which lasted for a period of 37 years.
                    He built the royal city of El-Katâë', between El- ’ Askar and Mount Mukattam,
                    enriched it with splendid buildings, and constituted it the seat of his
                    government. Its site is now covered with ruins, only his great mosque remaining
                    a proud example of his wealth and magnificence, still the largest mosque of
                    Cairo, and, as presenting the earliest specimens of the pointed arch, noteworthy
                    in the history of architecture. The reign of this vigorous and wise prince was
                    remarkable for prosperity at home and conquests abroad. He took Barkah, and in
                    Syria in 264 captured Damascus, Hims (Emessa), Hamah, and Aleppo; after which he
                    proceeded to Antioch, and the governor refusing to surrender, he took that city
                    by storm. He then advanced towards Tarsus, but his supplies failing he was
                    compelled to retire. About five years later, Lu-lu, his deputy and governor of
                    Aleppo and other towns in Syria and in Mesopotamia, revolted and entered into a
                    league with El-Muwaffik. It was apparently after an expedition against this
                    rebel that Ahmad died, in the year 270 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 884).
                    During the latter years of his reign, he had abandoned that simplicity of life
                    which had distinguished his youth, and had given himself up to boundless luxury.
                    At his death, there was found in his treasury ten millions of deenars, and his
                    establishment was discovered to consist of 7000 mounted memiooks, 300 picked
                    horses for his own use, a body-guard of 24,000 slaves, besides 6000 asses and
                    mules, 10,000 camels, and 100 wherries. By what oppression the revenue necessary
                    to maintain such a household was raised some idea may be formed, when it is
                    stated that at the time of his death 18,000 persons were confined in
                    Ibn-Tooloon’s prisons.</p>
                <p>Khumâraweyh, on the death of his father, was appointed his successor by the army,
                    he being then twenty years old, and he inherited a kingdom extending from the
                    Euphrates to Nubia. He fought a battle with the forces of the caliph, commanded
                    by a son of El-Muwafhk (afterwards the caliph El-Moatadid), between Damascus and
                    Ramleh; in which his army gained the victory, although he himself, never having
                    seen a battle before, fled the scene of action in a panic, drawing a large part
                    of his troops after him. But he soon reversed the independent policy of his
                    father, and making peace with the caliph in 273 he not only put the latter’s
                    name with that of his brother El-Muwaffik in the public prayers, but entirely
                    omitted his own; though it must be allowed he did not pursue the same servile
                    course in his coinage. On the accession of El-Moatadid in 279, Khumâraweyh
                    continued his conciliatory policy and offered his daughter Katr-en-Nedà
                    (Dewdrops) in marriage to the caliph’s son. In 282 he made an incursion into the
                    Greek territory, and died at Damascus. It is said that he was fearful of
                    assassination; to avoid which he had trained a lion to guard him while he slept
                    on his bed of quicksilver. His fears were justified; for he was put to death by
                    his women, or according to some by his eunuchs.</p>
                <p>His eldest son, Geysh Abu-1-’Asâkir, not yet fourteen years old, succeeded him.
                    This prince was killed in less than eight months: his youth, which rendered him
                    unfit to govern, occasioned his fall; for he had discarded from his society
                    those who were in favour with his father, and associated with none but worthless
                    men. He was succeeded in 283 by his brother Haroon, the principal events of
                    whose rule were a great tempest and earthquake in Egypt in 286, and a treaty
                    which he concluded with the caliph, by which the provinces of Awâsim and
                    Kinnesreen were ceded to him and the annual tribute from Egypt was fixed at
                    450,000 deenars. He reigned upwards of eight years, but gave himself up to
                    pleasure, and, as some say, was put to death in 292 by his uncles Sbeyban and
                    Àdee, sons of the founder of the dynasty, the former of whom succeeded to the
                    government. In the meantime, at the instigation of the generals of Hâroon,
                    Mohammad Ibn-Suleymân, a scribe of Lu-lu, advanced against Egypt with a numerous
                    and heavily equipped army. Sheybân went forth to meet him with all the forces he
                    could muster, but numbers of his troops deserted to the invader, and he was soon
                    compelled to surrender. Mohammad Ibn-Suleymân burned El-Katâë’, and sacked
                    El-Fustât, reducing the women to slavery, committing many atrocities, and
                    exiling the family of Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon, with all their adherents <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.h.</hi> 292, A. D. 905).</p>
                <p>Having thus completed his conquest, and restored the province of Egypt to the
                    house of ’Abbâs, Ibn-Suleymân yielded the government to ’ Eesa En-N6sharee,
                    appointed by El-Muktefee. He died in 297, and was followed by Tekeen El-Gezeree,
                    under whose rule Egypt was invaded by the forces of Obeyd-Allah El-Mahdee, first
                    prince of the dynasty of the Fâtimees, which had succeeded the Benee-l-Aghlab in
                    the dominion of Northern Africa. His general Hubâsheh, having taken Barkah,
                    advanced (in 302), with an army of 100,000 men, to Alexandria, which he found
                    deserted, and thence marched to the Feiyoom, where Tekeen, reinforced with
                    troops from El-Irâk, gave battle, and defeated the enemy in a sanguinary
                    conflict. In the following year, he was succeeded by Abu-l-Hasan Zekee
                    Kr·Roomee, in whose time El-Mahdee again attempted the conquest of Egypt with an
                    army under the command of his son, Abu-1- Kâsim; Alexandria fell into his hands
                    in 307; its inhabitants fled, and Zekee entrenched himself in El-Geezeh, on the
                    western bank of the Nile, and shortly afterwards died. In this emergency Tekeen
                    was reinstated in his office; and a fleet of twenty-five sail was sent from
                    Tarsus by the caliph, which meeting with the flotilla of the enemy off Resheed
                    almost annihilated it. Tekeen, meanwhile, had defeated the Africans, but without
                    decisive effect. At length, being twice reinforced from Baghdad, he drove
                    Abu-Kâsim back to Barkah. After rendering this important service Tekeen was
                    again recalled. Three other governors were then successively appointed; but the
                    troops revolting, and much sedition and rapine ensuing, Tekeen was once more
                    despatched to Egypt, where he remained until his death in the year 321 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 933).</p>
                <p>He was followed by Aboo-bekr Mohammad El-Ikhsheed lbn-Ta-ghag, afterwards the
                    founder of the dynasty of the Ikhsheedees, who was almost immediately superseded
                    by another governor; and for one year more Egypt continued to be a province of
                    the caliphs of Baghdâd. In the year 323, El-lkhsheed again succeeded to the
                    government. About this time little remained to the caliph of his once broad
                    empire beyond the province of Baghdâd, and even there his power was but nominal.
                    Khurasân, Fars, Kannan, Rei, Ispahân, Mosul, and the provinces of Mesopotamia,
                    were either in a state of revolt, or nearly or wholly lost to him. Spain was
                    governed by the Dynasty of Umeiyeh, and Africa by that of El-Mahdee; and we have
                    seen the distracted state of Egypt since the fall of the Benee-Tooloon.
                    El-Ikhsheed availed himself of these circumstances to make himself the
                    independent sovereign of Egypt and Syria, continuing, however, to acknowledge
                    the spiritual supremacy of the caliph. Shortly after, he defeated the forces of
                    El-Mahdee, who had again made an inroad into the country: and in 327 he was
                    decorated by Er-Râdee with the title of El-Ikhsheed, a name borne by the rulers
                    of the province of Ferghâneh in Transoxania, from whom he was descended. In the
                    following year Ibn-Râïk subdued a great part of Syria, and having taken Damascus
                    advanced to the frontier of Egypt, where after a very severe engagement he was
                    utterly routed and pursued by the troops of El-Ikhsheed as far as Damascus.
                    There, however, the fortune of war turned against El-lkhsheed, and for a time he
                    was deprived of the province of Syria, though he subsequently regained
                    possession of it. During his reign, the caliphs of Baghdâd were daily losing
                    power, and in the year 333, El-Muktefee wrote to him lamenting his miserable
                    state; whereupon El-Ikhsheed immediately repaired to him at Rakkah with valuable
                    presents and offered him assistance and an asylum in Egypt, of which the caliph
                    was too timid to avail himself. About this time, also, he conducted a war with
                    various success against Seyf-ed-Dowleh the Hamdânee, who had attacked Syria. He
                    died at Damascus in 334 (A.D. 946), in the 66th year of his age, and was buried,
                    as were his sons, in the mosque of Omar at Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Of El-lkhsheed’s two sons and successors, Abu-1-Kâsim Oongoor (who died in 349),
                    and Abu-l-Hasan ’Alee, little is known, their vizir Kâfoor, a black eunuch,
                    being the actual ruler. In the reign of the former, in the year 343, a great
                    fire occurred in El-Fustât, which destroyed 1700 houses and much merchandise.
                    Kâfoor succeeded to the throne in 355, and was acknowledged throughout Egypt,
                    Syria, and the Higâz. He ruled with great ability, and was a patron of
                    literature; his name is celebrated by the poet El-Mutanebbee, who was his
                    boon-companion, and whom, as well as other learned men, he rewarded with
                    magnificent presents. On his death in 357, internal dissensions respecting the
                    succession of Abu-1-Fuwâris, a son of ’Alee, presented a favourable opportunity
                    to the Fâtimee caliph to renew the often-repeated invasions of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, with few exceptions, the most notable of which are the reigns of
                    Ibn-Tooloon, Khumâraweyh, El-Ikhsheed, and Kâfoor, the Muslim rulers of Egypt
                    had not much benefited the country, or rescued it from the anarchy and troubles
                    in which it had become involved under the Lower Empire. But the incidents of the
                    time are so little known that they have been deemed worthy of more mention in
                    this article than perhaps their importance would otherwise warrant. From the
                    period at which we have now arrived, however, the annals of Egypt contain much
                    important matter, and are so closely interwoven with the events of the Crusades
                    as to lender them deeply interesting to the student of European history. The
                    rise of the schismatic caliphs of Africa is a remarkable episode in the early
                    days of El-Islâm, and most of the princes of that dynasty were not unworthy of
                    their successors, the renowned Saladin and his family, and the Memlook
                    sultans.</p>
                <p>In the year 358 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 969) El-Mo'izz li-deeni-llâh, the
                    fouτth Fâtimee caliph, equipped a large and well-aimed force, with a formidable
                    body of cavalry, the whole under the command of Abu- 1-Hoseyn Gohar el-Kâïd, a
                    native of Greece, and a slave of Lis father El-Mansoor. This general, on his
                    aιτival near Alexandria, received a deputation from the inhabitants of
                    El-Fustât, charged to negotiate a treaty. Their overtures were favourably
                    entertained, and the conquest of the country seemed probable without
                    bloodshed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n774/mode/1up"

                <p>But, while the conditions were being ratified, the Ikhsheedees prevailed on the
                    people to revoke their offer, and the ambassadors on their return were
                    themselves compelled to seek safety in flight. Gohar lost no time in pushing
                    forward. Before El-Geezeh a partial combat took place; several days were passed
                    in skirmishes, and at length he forced the passage of the Nile a few miles south
                    of that town, at the head of his troops. Here the Ikhsheedees offered a brave
                    resistance; the greater part were left dead on the field, and the remainder,
                    taking what valuables they could carry off, fled from El-Fustât. The former
                    mediators were now brought to intercede for the inhabitants and the women of the
                    fallen dynasty, and to the honour of the African general it is related that they
                    were pardoned and the city was peaceably occupied. The submission of the rest of
                    Egypt was secured by this victory; and all the Higâz, including the holy cities,
                    and the Yemen, speedily acknowledged the authority of the Fâtimee El-Mo’izz. In
                    the year 359 Syria was also added to his dominions, but shortly after was
                    overrun by the Karmatees (Carmathians), the troops of El-Mo’izz met with several
                    reverses, Damascus was taken, and those lawless freebooters, joined by the
                    Ikhsheedees, advanced to ’Eyn-Shems. In the meanwhile, Gohar had fortified
                    EI-Kahireh,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The modern
                    Cairo was originally called El-Mansooreeyeh; El-Mo’izz, however, changed its
                    name to that of El-Kihireh, by reason of an omen at its foundation. For details
                    respecting this and the other capitals of Egypt under the Muslims, see the
                    sketch in the <hi rend="italic">Englishwoman in Egypt,</hi> vol. i. 124, <hi
                    rend="italic">seqq.</hi> in which the author has availed herself of the valuable

                    immediately north of El-Fustât), and taken every precaution to repel the
                    invaders; a bloody battie was fought on Friday, the 1st of Rabeea el-0wwal, in
                    the year 361, before the city walls, without any decisive result. On the
                    following Sunday, however, Gohar obtained a great victory over the enemy, who
                    experienced a reverse more complete than any before suffered, and the camp and
                    baggage fell into the hands of the conqueror.</p>
                <p>At the earnest solicitations of his lieutenant, who had ruled Egypt both ably and
                    justly, with almost absolute authority, ElMo’izz at length determined to remove
                    his court to his new kingdom. In Ramadan 362, he entered El-Kalιireh, bringing
                    with him the bodies of his three predecessors and vast treasure. ElMo’izz
                    reigned about two years in Egypt, dying in the year 365. He is described as a
                    warlike and ambitious prince, but, notwithstanding, he was especially
                    distinguished for justice and was fond of learning. He showed great favour to
                    the Christians, especially to Severus, bishop of El-Ashmooneyιι, and the
                    patriarch Ephrem; and under his orders, and with his assistance, the church of
                    the Mu’allakah, in Old Misr, was rebuilt. He executed many useful works, (among
                    others rendering navigable the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which is still called
                    the canal of El-Mo’izz), and occupied himself in embellishing El-Kâhireh. Gohar,
                    when he founded that city built the great mosque named El-Azhar, the university
                    of Egypt, which to this day is crowded with students from all parts of the
                    Muslim world. The principal event of his reign in Egypt was the second irruption
                    of Hasan the Karmatee. The enemy, as on the former occasion, reached ’Eyn-Shems;
                    but now he gained more advantage over the African troops. Although he was twice
                    defeated in different parts of Egypt, and constantly harassed in his advance,
                    the capital was closely besieged by him, and its defenders were driven across
                    the fosse. Thus straitened, El-Mo’izz had recourse to stratagem, and succeeded
                    in bribing Hasan Ibn-El-Garrâh (who, with a body of the tribe of Tei, fought
                    with the Karmatees) to desert them in the heat of the next battle. The result of
                    this plan was successful, and again Hasan was defeated and compelled to flee.
                    This event, which occurred in the year 363, relieved Egypt of another invader,
                    an ally of Hasan, byname Abd-Allah Ibn-’Obeyd-Allah (formerly governor of Syria
                    under Kafoor), and obtained for the arms of El-Mo’izz various successes in
                    Syria.</p>
                <p>El-’Azeez Aboo-Mansoor Nizâr, on coming to the throne of his father, immediately
                    despatched an expedition against the Turkish chief El-Eftekeen, who had taken
                    Damascus a short time previously. Gohar again commanded the army, and pressed
                    the siege of that city so vigorously that the enemy called to their aid the
                    Karmatees. Before this united army he retired by little and little to Ascalon,
                    where he prepared to stand a siege; but being reduced to great straits, he
                    purchased his liberty with a large sum of money. On his return from this
                    disastrous campaign, El-’Azeez took the command in person, and meeting the enemy
                    at Ramleh, was victorious after a bloody battle; while El-Eftekeen, being
                    betrayed into his hands, was with Arab magnanimity received with honour and
                    confidence, and ended his days in Egypt in affluence. El-’Azeez followed his
                    father’s example of liberality. It is even said that he appointed a Jew his
                    vizir in Syria, and a Christian to the same post in Egypt. These acts, however,
                    nearly cost him his life, and a popular tumult obliged him to disgrace both
                    these officers. After a reign of twenty-one years of great internal prosperity
                    he died <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.h.</hi> 386) in a bath at Bilbeys, while
                    preparing an expedition against the Greeks who were ravaging his possessions in
                    Syria.</p>
                <p>El-’Azeez was distinguished for moderation and mildness, but his son and
                    successor rendered himself notorious for very opposite qualities. El-Hakim
                    bi-amri-llâh Aboo-’Alee Mansoor began his reign, according to Muslim historians,
                    with much wisdom, but afterwards acquired a character for impiety, cruelty, and
                    unreasoning extravagance, by which he has been rendered odious to posterity. He
                    is described as possessing at once “courage and boldness and cowardice and
                    timorousness, a love for learning and vindictiveness towards the learned, an
                    inclination to righteousness and a disposition to slay the righteous;” and this
                    character is fully borne out by his many extravagances. Of his cruelty numerous
                    anecdotes are told us, especially in the discharge of his functions as Mohtesib,
                    or “regulator of the markets and of the weights and measures,” an office which
                    he assumed, and in wlrich he became the terror of the inhabitants. But his
                    cruelty was surpassed by his impiety. He arrogated to himself divinity, and
                    commanded his subjects to rise at the mention of his name in the congregational
                    prayers, an edict which was obeyed even in the holy cities, Mecca and Medinah.
                    He is most famous in connection with the Druses, a sect which he founded and
                    which still holds him in veneration and believes in his future return to the
                    earth. He had made himself obnoxious to all classes of his subjects, when, in
                    the year 397, he nearly lost his throne by foreign invasion. Hishâm, surnamed
                    Aboo-Rekweh, a descendant of the house of Umeiyeh in Spain, took the province of
                    Barkah with a considerable force and subdued Upper Egypt. The caliph, aware of
                    his danger, immediately collected his troops from every quarter of the kingdom,
                    and marched against the invader, whom, after severe fighting, he defeated and
                    put to flight. Hishâm himself was taken prisoner, paraded in Cairo with every
                    aggravation of cruelty, and put to death. El-Hakim having thus by vigorous
                    measures averted this danger, Egypt continued to groan under his tyranny until
                    the year 411, when he fell by domestic treachery. His sister Seyyidet-el-Mulook
                    had, in common with the rest of his subjects, incurred his displeasure; and
                    being fearful for her life, she secretly and by night concerted measures with
                    the emeer Seyf-ed-Dowleh, chief of the guard, who very readily agreed to her
                    plans. Ten slaves, bribed by 500 deenârs each, having received their
                    instructions, went forth on the appointed day to the desert tract southward of
                    Cairo, where El-Hakim, unattended, was in the habit of riding, and waylaid him
                    near the village of Hulwân, where they put him to death.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by his son, Edh-Dhahir (commonly pronounced Ez-Zâhir) bi-llâh
                    Abu-l-Hasan ’Alee, who ruled with justice and moderation for nearly sixteen
                    years. In 414 Aleppo was taken by Salih Ibn-Mardas; and although he was defeated
                    and slain by an Egyptian force sent against him, a son, Shibl-ed-Dowleh, yet
                    retained possession of that city. At this time also Hasan, of the tribe of Tei,
                    before mentioned, had made himself master of Ramleh; and indeed from this
                    caliph’s reign we may date the decline of the Fatimee power, especially in
                    Syria.</p>
                <p>In the year 427, El-Mustansir bi-llah Aboo-Temeem Ma’add came to the throne at
                    the age of seven years. His reign occupied a long period, rendered remarkable by
                    the unparalleled troubles which befell Egypt. It commenced prosperously with the
                    defeat and death of Shibl-ed-Dowleh. Aleppo was taken, and the submission of the
                    rest of Syria followed; and the general who had conducted the expedition against
                    that province assumed its government. On his death, Mo’izz-ed-Dowleli, a brother
                    of Shibl-ed-Dowleh, retook Aleppo in 433; but the various fortunes of this
                    prince and his nephew Mahmood, from this time and during the calamities of
                    Egypt, are too complicated and subordinate to claim a place here. In the western
                    provinces, the rebel El-Mo’izz (the third successor of Yoosuf Ibn-Zeyree, who
                    was appointed governor on the conquest of Egypt), was punished by an irruption
                    of wild Arab tribes in the pay of El-Mustansir.</p>
                <p>In the year 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.i&gt;.</hi> 1058), the Fatimee caliph was
                    publicly prayed for in Baghdad,—a remarkable event, of which the immediate cause
                    was briefly as follows. El-Besâseeree, a powerful Turkish chief exercising
                    unbounded authority in that city, had fallen into disgrace, and received
                    supplies of men and money from the caliph of Egypt; and while the Seljookee
                    sultan Tughril-Beg espoused the cause of the ’Abbâsee caliph, his brother
                    lbraheem Eyna,l revolted, joined El-Besâseeree, and defeated Tughril-Beg.
                    El-Besâseeree entered Baghdad, in which the combat continued to rage; and the
                    unfortunate city was devastated by massacre and pillage. El-Mustansir was
                    solemnly declared Prince of the Faithful, and the insignia of the legitimate
                    caliph was sent to El-Kâhireh. The success of El-Besâseeree, however, was but
                    transient; Tughril-Beg had, in the meantime, defeated and killed his brother
                    Ibraheem; he then entered Baghdad in Dhu-l-Kaadah 451, and despatched a force
                    against El-Besâseeree, who fell in a battle near El-Koofeh.</p>
                <p>A persecution of the Christians of Alexandria occurred about this time; and in
                    454 commenced a desolating struggle between the blacks and the Turks, both of
                    whom had become numerous in Egypt. The former were succoured by the mother of
                    El-Mustansir, <pb break="no"

                    latter was taken by Nâsir-ed-Dowleh Ibn-Hamdân, a general of El-Mustansir, more
                    than once governor of Damascus, and at this period governor of Lower Egypt. To
                    this man’s unscrupulous ambition was due much of the trouble which ensued. After
                    many battles the Turks succeeded in destroying the power of their adversaries,
                    and their leader assumed almost absolute authority, while they not only extorted
                    from the caliph immense sums of money and treasure, but even rifled the tombs of
                    his predecessors for the valuables which they contained. At the same time the
                    bulk of the valuable library of the Fâtimees was dispersed by these brigands.
                    But the very power of Nasir-ed-Dowleh threatened his overthrow. His sense of
                    security in his position rendered him regardless of the support of the Turks;
                    and when at length his schemes for the deposition of El-Mustansir brought
                    matters to a crisis, a large portion of the army declared against him. Defeated
                    and driven from the metropolis, he succeeded in possessing himself of Lower
                    Egypt, and a terrible civil war raged between the contending parties. But an
                    even heavier calamity afflicted Egypt. For seven successive years the inundation
                    of the Nile failed, and with it almost the entire subsistence of the country,
                    while the rebels intercepted supplies of grain from the north. El-Makreezee
                    informs us that El-’Askar and EI-Katâë’ were depopulated, and that half the
                    inhabitants of El-Fustat perished, while in El-Kahireh itself the people were
                    reduced to the direst straits. Bread was sold for 14 dirhems the 1 lb loaf; and
                    all provision being exhausted, the worst horrors of famine followed. The
                    wretched people resorted to cannibalism, and organized bands kidnapped the
                    unwary passenger in the desolate streets by means of ropes furnished with hooks
                    and let down from the latticed windows. In the year 462 the famine reached its
                    height. It was followed by a pestilence; and in the midst of these horrors,
                    Nâsir-ed-Dowleh advanced on El-Kâhireh at the head of an enormous army; he was
                    induced to withdraw by the promise of large concessions, only to repeat the
                    attack, and finally to make himself master of the city, after having inflicted a
                    signal defeat on the caliph, who became only the nominal raler of Egypt, a
                    condition which lasted until the assassination of this powerful rebel in the
                    year 465.</p>
                <p>While these events were occurring in Egypt, Syria was in a continual state of
                    anarchy and war. A distinguished general, the emeer El-Guyoosh Bedr-ed-Deen
                    El-Gemâlee, held the government of Damascus during these times; and now
                    El-Mustansir wrote, recalling him to assume the office of vizir of Egypt. On the
                    condition of being allowed to bring with him a veteran force, he, happily for
                    the country, obeyed the summons, and to his talents was owing the restoration of
                    order and even prosperity which followed. By a massacre of emeers at a grand
                    banquet shortly after his arrival, and by numerous executions, he subdued all
                    opposition in the capital; and in a series of brilliant victories he annihilated
                    the savage hordes who infested the country throughout its whole extent, having
                    either been called to the aid of the contending parties, or voluntarily taken
                    advantage of the universal confusion to commit their lawless ravages.</p>
                <p>In concluding this necessarily extended notice of the reign of El-Mustansir, the
                    invasion of Aksees with an army of Turkumans, Kurds, and Arabs, in the year 469,
                    mιi3t be mentioned. Spreading devastation around them, they encamped near
                    El-Kâhireh; and in the first engagement defeated the forces of El-Gemalee; but
                    fortune favouring him in a second battle, the enemy was totally routed with
                    immense carnage.</p>
                <p>El-Mustansir reigned 60 years, and died in the year 487. He was a weak prince,
                    solely given up to pleasure. El-Gemâlee had governed with almost absolute
                    authority and great ability for a period of 20 years, dying only a few days
                    before the caliph. While admiring El-Gemalee’s talents, we cannot but condemn
                    his severity. He built the mosque which gives its name to the mountain
                    immediately S.E. of the citadel of El-Kâhireh (Gebel-El-Guyooshee), and the
                    second wall of the city, with its three principal gates, Bâb-Zuweyleh,
                    Bâb-en-Nasr, and Bâb-el-Futooh. These gates, which are very fine specimens of
                    architecture, are said to be the work of three Greek brothers.</p>
                <p>El-Mustaalee bi-llah Abu-1-Kâsim Ahmad succeeded his father; but a son of
                    El-Gemâlee, El-Afdal, had the principal management of the affairs of the
                    kingdom. This caliph’s reign is memorable for the First Crusade. El-Afdal had
                    taken Jerusalem from the Turks in the year 491 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.t&gt;.</hi> 1098); and a few months later it yielded to the Crusaders, after
                    a siege of 40 days. El-Afdal arrived shortly after its fall with a reinforcement
                    of 20,000 men, but he was defeated in the battle of Ascalon. Later, an Egyptian
                    army, commanded by Saad-ed-Dowleh, was worsted by Baldwin, count of Edessa, and
                    the general was killed in the action. From this period, with the exception of
                    some efforts made in the next reign, to the time of Salah-ed-deen (“Saladin”),
                    Egypt was too much occupied with intestine troubles to equip expeditions against
                    the various parties who now straggled for the possession of Syria. El-Mustaalee
                    died in the year 495. He is stated to have been a S∏nnee, a strange anomaly in a
                    dynasty of Shiya’ces.</p>
                <p>His son El-A'mir bi-ahkâmi-llâh Aboo-’Alee Mansoor came to the throne at the age
                    of five years, and until his arrival at manhood the government was conducted by
                    El-Afdal. The first act of the caliph, however, on taking it into his own hands,
                    was to put his minister to death, and appoint in his stead a man whose
                    wickedness obliged him to imprison him and afterwards condemn him to death. The
                    rale of El-A'mir was chiefly remarkable for his impiety and tyranny, and for the
                    successes of the Crusaders, who, having reduced many of the principal
                    coast-towns in Syria, meditated the conquest of Egypt, and crossed the frontier,
                    but were deterred from the prosecution of their enterprise by the illness of
                    Baldwin, whose death took place at El-Areesh, on his way back to Jerusalem.
                    El-A'mir was put to death in 524, at the town of El-Geezeh, it is said by
                    partisans of El-Afdal, whose son then usurped the entire government, setting up,
                    as caliph, El-Hâfidh li-deeni-llâh Abd-El-Megeed, a grandson of El-Mustansir
                    (El-Ämir having left no male issue), but without the usual ceremonies of
                    installation. This vizir, Aboo-’Alee Ahmad, even forbade the mention of
                    El-Hâfidh in the public prayers, and inserted his own name in his stead. He
                    perished in a popular tumult, roused by his extortions and arbitrary' rule, and
                    El-Hâfidh was duly declared caliph and received the oaths of allegiance. After
                    the death of Ahmad, he successively appointed three other vizirs; but these
                    proving equally refractory, he at length dispensed with that office altogether.
                    He reigned nearly 20 years. The licentiousness of his son and successor,
                    Edh-Dhâfir bi-aadâï-llâh Aboo-Mansoor Isma’eel, occasioned his death in four
                    years and seven months at the hand of his vizir El-’Abbâs.</p>
                <p>El-Faïz bi-llah Abu-1-Kâsim ’ Eesa Ibn-’Aleewas, on his accession in 549, only
                    five years of age, and the history' of his times presents merely the contentions
                    of rival vizirs, of whom the chief were El-Melik Es-Salih Tataë Ibn-Ruzzeyk, and
                    his competitor El-’Abbas, before named. The latter, finding his power failing,
                    gathered together the wealth he had amassed and fled to Syria, where he fell
                    into the hands of the Crusaders, who stripped him of all that he had and
                    detained him a prisoner. Eventually he was given up to Tataë and crucified over
                    the gates of the palace.</p>
                <p>El-Faïz died in the year 555, and El-’Adid li-deeni-llâh Aboo-Mohamrnad
                    Abd-Allah, a grandson of El-Hafidh, and the last of the Fâtimee caliphs, was
                    raised to what was then but the shadow of a throne, the entire power being in
                    the hands of Tataë, who by his oppression and cruelty well-nigh rendered
                    El-’Adid, by nature benevolent and wise, as tyrannical as himself. He was
                    assassinated after a year by the secret orders of the caliph, and the latter to
                    conceal his agency in this act installed his son El-’Àdil in his place. At this
                    time the well-known Shawir was governor of the Sa’eed (or Upper Egypt), a post
                    next in importance to that of prime minister. During the last three reigns the
                    vizirs had been rapidly increasing in power; and the annals of the period are
                    entirely occupied with the rise and fall of potent grandees, all eager for a
                    post which conferred on its possessor the supreme authority. At length, in the
                    reign of this unfortunate prince, they consummated the rain of,the dynasty and
                    overwhelmed themselves in its fall. In 558 El-’Adil dispossessed Shawir of his
                    government, and the latter had immediate recourse to arms, marched against his
                    enemy, and succeeded in putting him to death. He then constituted himself vizir,
                    but in his turn was compelled to flee from a more powerful rival, Ed-Dirgham.
                    Noor-ed-Deen (Noureddin), the sultan of Damascus, received the fugitive with
                    favour; and in the course of the next year (559) despatched an army to Egypt,
                    under the command of Asad-ed-Deen Sheerkooh, to reinstate him. In the meantime
                    Ed-Dirgham had been busy putting to death the great men of the empire; and
                    having thus weakened his power, he offered but a feeble resistance, was
                    overthrown in a battle near the tomb of the Seyyideh Nefeeseh, on the S. of
                    El-Kahireh, and Shawir was restored. No sooner, however, was this effected, than
                    he forgot the engagements into which he had entered with Noureddin, and threw
                    off his allegiance to him. Sheerkooh retired to the Sharkeeyeh, and occupied the
                    town of Bilbeys, and thence threatened Shawir. In this position of affairs the
                    latter had recourse to the Crusaders, who willingly responded to his call, and
                    Amaury, king of Jerusiflem, arrived with a considerable force. With these
                    allies, Shawir besieged his former protector in Bilbeys, until, hearing of
                    Noureddin’s successes over the Franks in Syria, they negotiated a peace, and
                    permitted Sheerkooh to withdraw from Egypt. About two years later, Noureddin,
                    determined on punishing the treachery of Shawir, again sent Sheerkooh into Egypt
                    with a great army, and accompanied by his nephew, the famous Saladin. Shawir
                    again sought to strengthen himself by an alliance with Amaury, from whom he
                    received the first intelligence of the meditated invasion. Apprised of this
                    knowledge of his movements, Sheerkooh changed his course from Bilbeys, entered
                    the valley of the Nile at some distance above Cairo, and crossing the river
                    marched northwards to El-Geezeh. Here he endeavoured to raise ths people against
                    Shawir and his Frank confederates; and had in some measure su∞eeded when the
                    superior forces of the enemy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n776/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0776-0753"/> compelled him to retreat southwards as far as
                    El-Babeyn, near Ashinooneyn, where he risked an engagement, and gained a
                    complete victory. . This success opened to the invaders the greater part of
                    Egypt, and Alexandria itself fell into their hands. Saladin was placed in that
                    city with a numerous garrison, and his uncle departed to subdue the rest of
                    Egypt. The Crusaders, however, at once closely invested Alexandria, and so
                    pressed the siege for three months, as to oblige Sheerkooh to come to its
                    relief. An honourable compromise was effected, by which the Syrians agreed to
                    resign their conquests and evacuate Egypt. But fresh troubles were in store for
                    this unfortunate country. Amaury, irritated at the result of a campaign in which
                    he had only lost, determined on an expedition against his recent ally; and,
                    entering Egypt, took Bilbeys, putting its inhabitants to the sword, and laid
                    siege to El-Kahireh, his course being marked by the most dreadful barbarities.
                    On his approach, the ancient city of El-Fustât was set on fire by order of the
                    vizir, to prevent it falling into the enemy’s hands, and it continued bunιing
                    somewhat more than fifty days. El-’Adid now earnestly sought the aid of
                    Noureddin; and that monarch, actuated by religious zeal against the Franks, who
                    had already felt his power in Syria, and by the desire of conquest, once more
                    despatched Sheerkooh. In the meantime negotiations had been opened with Amaury
                    to raise the siege of El-Kâhireh, on payment of an enormous sum of money; while,
                    however, the conditions were yet unfulfilled, the approach of the Syrian army
                    induced him to retreat in all haste. Sheerkooh and Saladin entered the capital
                    in great state, were received with honour by the caliph and with obsequiousness
                    by the perfidious Shâwir, who was contriving a plot which was fortunately
                    discovered and for wlιich he <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> paid with his head.
                    Sheerkooh was then appointed vizer by El-’Adid, but dying very shortly, he was
                    succeeded in that dignity by Saladin 564 (A.υ. 1169).</p>
                <p>For the short period which elapsed before Saladin’s assumption of the title of
                    sultan a few words will suffice. One of his first acts was to put to death the
                    chief of the eunuchs, and a revolt of the blacks resulted; a combat took place
                    in El-Kâhireh in the street called Beyn-el-Kasreyn; and the malcontents being
                    worsted, the disturbances were quelled. Bahâ-ed-Deen Karâkoosh, a white eunuch,
                    who afterwards played a prominent part in the reign of Saladin, was appointed to
                    the vacant post. This gave the vizir great in∩uence in the palace, of which he
                    judiciously availed himself. In 565 we hear of Amaury with Greek allies
                    unsuccessfully besieging Damietta; and in the following year, Saladin conducted
                    an expedition against the Franks to Ascalon and Ramleh. In, 567, by order of
                    Noureddin, he suppressed the name of El-’Adid in the congregational prayers, and
                    substituted that of the ’ Abbasee caliph, a masterly stroke of policy to secure
                    the adhesion of the orthodox Muslims. The last of the Fâtimees was lying
                    dangerously ill, and his relations concealed from him his degradation. He died
                    without the knowledge of it, and with him perished an illustrious but
                    unfortunate dynasty.</p>
                <p>Saladin was thus relieved of the most serious obstacle on his way to the throne;
                    yet he dared not throw off his allegiance to the sultan of Damascus, but
                    prudently waited for a favourable opportunity. Noureddin’s suspicion was already
                    aroused, and he died (in 569) while secretly preparing to proceed in person to
                    Egypt. Saladin almost immediately proclaimed himself sultan of Egypt, and
                    inaugurated his reign with a series of brilliant successes. With the conquest of
                    El-Mo’izz, Egypt again took an important place among the nations; and by the
                    wars of Saladin it became the nucleus of a great empire. But military glory was
                    not the sole aim of this prince and his successors. The patronage they continued
                    to extend to letters and the arts had the most beneficial effect upon the
                    civilization of the couutry.</p>
                <p>Saladin, whose full appellation was El-Melik En-Nâsir Salâh-ed-deen Yoosuf
                    Ibn-Eiyoob, ' acquired his greatest renown by his campaigns against the
                    Crusaders in Syria. As these belong, however, more properly to the history of
                    those wars than to that of Egypt, they will be more briefly noticed in this
                    place than would otherwise be necessary. The youth of El-Melik Es-Sâlih
                    Isma’eel, the son and successor of Noureddin, and the consequent confusion which
                    prevailed in his dominions, gave Saladin a fair pretext to occupy Damascus, as
                    the guardian of the young prince, and enabled him to wrest from him his kingdom.
                    He thus considerably enlarged his territory, made himself master of a great
                    portion of Syria, and continued to consolidate his power in those parts until
                    the year 572 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1178), when Philip, count of
                    Flanders, laid siege to Antioch, and Saladin entered Palestine. Having encamped
                    before Ascalon, the Egyptian troops ravaged the neighbouring country, and set
                    fire to Joppa, until at length Baldwin the Leper, king of Jerusalem, issued from
                    Ascalon and gave them battle. The result was disastrous to Saladin: his army was
                    totally routed, and he himself fled alone on a dromedary. After this, however,
                    he gained some partial advantages over the Christians, till a terrible famine
                    induced him two years later to conclude a truce with the king of Jerusalem and
                    to retire to Egypt.</p>
                <p>In the year 576 he again entered Syria and made war on Kilij-Arslân, the
                    Seljookee sultan of Anatolia, and on Leon, king of Armenia, the Cilicio-Armenian
                    kingdom, both of whom he forced to make terms of peace. Not long after his
                    return, Saladin departed from Egypt <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.h.</hi> 578) to
                    prosecute a war with the Crusaders in which neither side desired peace. Their
                    hostility was aggravated by the following circumstances. A vessel bearing 1500
                    pilgrims had been wrecked near Damietta, and its passengers captured; and to the
                    remonstrances of the king of Jerusalem the sultan replied by complaining of the
                    constant inroads made by Renaud de Châtillon. At this time the latter turbulent
                    chief undertook an expedition against Eyleh, and for this purpose constructed
                    boats at Karak and conveyed them on camels to the sea; but this flotilla was
                    repulsed, and ths siege raised by a fleet sent thither by El-’Ädil (“Saphedin
                    ”), the brother of Saladin, and then his viceroy; and a second attempt was still
                    more unfortunate, the Christian captives on that occasion were sacrificed in the
                    valley of Mina. Having threatened Karak, Saladin encamped at Tiberias, and
                    ravaged the territory of the Franks; he then besieged Beyroot, but in vain; and
                    thence turned his arms against Mesopotamia and subdued the country, but the city
                    of Mosul successfully resisted him. In the meanwhile, the Crusaders contented
                    themselves with miserable forays across the enemy’s borders, and made no serious
                    preparations for the return of their redoubtable antagonist. The latter, having
                    been almost everywhere successful in Mesopotamia, took Tell-Kh&lt;did and
                    ’Eyn-Tâb in Syria and obtained possession of Aleppo; he again besieged Karak,
                    ravaged the territory of Samaria, and later received the fealty of the lord of
                    Mosul, but not the keys of the city.</p>
                <p>In the year 582 (1186 of our era) war again broke out between Saladin and the
                    Crusaders. The sultan had respected a truce into which he had entered with
                    Baldwin the Leper, and Renaud, before named, was the first to break it. The
                    capture by the latter of a rich caravan enraged Saladin, who despatched orders
                    to all his lieutenants and vassals, summoning them to assist in the “Holy War.”
                    He marched <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1187) from Damascus to Karak, and
                    there laid close siege to Renaud; at the same time a large body of cavalry under
                    the command of his son, El-Afdal, advanced on Nazareth; and here a body of 130
                    Knights Hospitallers and Templars, seconded by a few hundred foot soldiers, and
                    encouraged by the heroic Jacques de Maillé, marshal of the Temple, by their
                    devotion immortalized their memory. Only the Grand Master of the Temple and two
                    of his knights escaped from the unequal struggle. Soon after, Saladin approached
                    in person at the head of an army of 80,000 men; and the Christians with their
                    whole force encountered him on the shore of the Lake of Tiberias. The result of
                    the battle which ensued was the heaviest blow which had yet fallen on the
                    Crusaders. Weakened by thirst, shaken by the flight of a part of their troops on
                    the second day of combat, and overwhelmed by numbers, the knights fought with
                    desperate courage, but at length were forced to the hills of Hitteem. A
                    multitude fell in this bloody fight, and among the prisoners were Guy <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n777/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0777-0754"/> do Lusignan (the king of Jerusalem and successor
                    of Baldwin), with his brother and Renaud de Châtillon. The number of prisonersis
                    almo3t incredible; and the massacre of many of them is an indelible stain on the
                    glory of the generally merciful Saladin. Tiberias, Ptolémaïs (Acre), NAbulus,
                    Jericho, Ramleh, Caesarea, Arsoor, Joppa, Beyroot, and many other places
                    successively fell into the hands of the conqueror. Tyre resisted his attacks;
                    but Ascalon surrendered on favourable terms, and the fall of Jerusalem crowned
                    these victories. The great clemency of Saladin on this occasion is chronicled by
                    Christian historians, though it is but slightly mentioned by the Muslims, who
                    took offence at the mercy shown to the enemies of their faith.</p>
                <p>After these events Tyre was again besieged, and when about to capitulate was
                    relieved by the arrival of Conrad, son of the marquis of Montferrat. The valiant
                    defence of the town wearied Saladin, who turned his arms against Tripoli; but
                    here he met with no better success. Bohemond, prince of Antioch, and at that
                    time possessor of Tripoli also, was, however, glad to obtain a truce of eight
                    months; and some strongholds (among others Karak) were taken. But now the
                    fortune of war turned against the sultan. The ever-memorable siege of Acre,
                    maintained with equal constancy by both Christians and Muslims, lasted upwards
                    of two years, and attracted the attention of the whole western world. At length
                    the immense reinforcements received by the besiegers, and the presence of
                    Richard Coeur de Lion of England and of Philip IL of France, enabled them to
                    overcome all resistance, and the standards of the Cross floated on the ramparts
                    of the city <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1191). A horrible act of barbarity
                    was here perpetrated: 2700 Muslim captives were massacred in cold blood, in
                    consequence of Saladin’s having failed to fulfil the terms of the capitulation;
                    and the palliative plea of the heat of an assault cannot be urged in extenuation
                    of this enormity. Richard has been accused of being its author; but Michaud
                    believes with reason that it was decided on in a council of the chiefs of the
                    Crusade. On another occasion, however, that king was certainly guilty of similar
                    cruelty.</p>
                <p>After a period of repose and debauchery, the army of the Crusaders, commanded by
                    Richard, directed its march towards Jerusalem. Saladin harassed his advance on
                    every point, rendered the cities and strongholds defenceless, and ravaged the
                    country. Richard, nevertheless, was ever victorious; his personal bravery struck
                    terror into the Muslims, and he gained a signal victory over the sultan in the
                    battle of Arsoor. But dissensions among the chiefs of his army and the uncertain
                    temper of the commander himself debarred the Crusaders from the attainment of
                    their great object, the deliverance of the Holy City; and when all the coast
                    from Joppa to Tyre was in the hands of the Christians, and the army of Saladin
                    was threatened with disorganization, a treaty was concluded, and Richard set
                    sail on his return to England. The glory acquired by Saladin, and the famous
                    campaigns of Coeur de Lion, have rendered the Third Crusade the most memorable
                    in history, and shed a lustre on the arms of both Muslims and Christians greater
                    than they ever attained in those wars, either before or afterwards.</p>
                <p>Saladin died about a year after the conclusion of this peace <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.π.</hi> 589 or J193 of our Era) at Damascus, at the age of fifty-seven
                    years. Ambition and religious zeal appear to have been his ruling passions; he
                    was courageous, magnanimous, and merciful, possessed of remarkable military
                    talents and great control over himself. His generosity to the vanquished and hrs
                    faithful observance of his passed word are lauded by the historians of the
                    Crusades; the former brought on him much obloquy among his own fierce soldiers,
                    and is a trait in his character which is worthy of note in the annals of a time
                    when this virtue was extremely rare. While engaged in the conduct of his
                    continual wars, he was not unmindful of the welfare of Egypt, and during his
                    reign many public works were executed. Of these we may mention especially the
                    citadel of Cairo, with the magnificent buildings which, until very recently, it
                    contained; the third wall of the city; and the repair of the great canal called
                    the Bahr Yoosuf, a very important and useful work. From the year 578 until the
                    period of his death he had not entered Egypt; but his brother El-Melik El-’Adil
                    Seyf-ed-deen (Saphedin) and other princes of his family successively governed
                    that country, and the eunuch Karâkoosh, who also defended Acre, held a large
                    share of authority.</p>
                <p>On the death of Saladin, his extensive dominions were divided chiefly among his
                    sons, and Egypt fell to the lot of one of them, El-Melik El-’Azeez Imâd-ed-Deen
                    ’ Othman. The grandees supported his claim to the throne, and he proved himself
                    worthy of their choice. In conjunction with El-’Adil, we find him warring
                    against the leaders of the Fourth Crusade. He reigned nearly six years, and was
                    succeeded (in 595) by his son El-Mansoor Mohammad, whose uncle El-Afdal was
                    compelled to relinquish the government of Damascus and assume the regency of
                    Egypt. Disagreement among the sons of Saladin had occurred soon after that
                    monarch’s death, and now hastened the rise of El-’Adil, who, by his military
                    talents and other remarkable qualities, had excited the fears of even his
                    brother. With the view of checking his growing ascendancy, El-Afdal formed an
                    alliance against him with Edh-' Dhahir, another son of Saladin and lord of
                    Aleppo, and besieged him in Damascus; but coming to strife, they raised the
                    siege in 597. This attempt proved fatal to the power of El-Afdal. He was pursued
                    to Egypt, in his turn besieged in El-Kâhireh, and forced to flee, and El-’Adil
                    was proclaimed sultan. Having dethroned El-Mansoor, he speedily recovered
                    Damascus from the hands of the confederate brothers, and Syria with Egypt
                    acknowledged his supremacy. El-’Àdil (as Saphedin) is especially known by his
                    opposition to the Fourth and Sixth Crusades, the former of which took place
                    before his accession to the throne. He repulsed the Christians near Nâbulus,
                    captured Joppa, and encountered the enemy between Tyre and Sidon. He was there
                    defeated with heavy loss, and Sidon, Laodicea, Gibleh, and Beyrout were taken.
                    But the Crusaders wasted their strength before the fortress of Thoron. El- ’Adil
                    raised the siege of that place, and although afterwards he met with a reverse
                    near Joppa, his adversaries bought a dear victory; and, having come to terms of
                    peace, they returned to Europe. In the year 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi>
                    1204) he departed to Syria with the object of securing Jerusalem against
                    threatened attacks, and concluded a trιιce which he offered to renew when about
                    to expire; and to prove his good faith, he strengthened that offer by promising
                    to cede ten castles to the Christians. These overtures were refused, and the
                    Muslim army drove the newly arrived king of Jerusalem, Jean de Brienne, back to
                    Europe. Those who remained then professed their willingness to accede to
                    conditions of peace, and we do not again hear of El-’Adil in Palestine until 614
                    (A.D. 1217), when he was once more called thither to oppose the Crusaders; but a
                    serious invasion of Egypt by these troublesome adventurers hastily recalled its
                    king, and he died of grief, it is said, on hearing of the advantages gained by
                    them.</p>
                <p>El-Kamil immediately (615) came to the throne, and took the most energetic
                    measures for the protection of his kingdom. In the meantime, the Franks had
                    besieged Damiettaboth by sea and land; and, notwithstanding every effort for the
                    relief of the place, its garrison was forced to capitulate. El-Kamil summoned to
                    his aid the princes of his family, and with every available man watched the
                    enemy’s movements. Flushed with success, Jean de Brienne commenced his march on
                    the capital; and with the characteristic carelessness of the Crusaders he took
                    no measures to secure supplies. His advance was stopped at the junction of the
                    canal of Ashmoon with the Nile, where he found El-Kamil in a very strong
                    position. Encamped on the opposite shore, the invaders depended for supplies on
                    Damietta and its immediate district; but the inundation of the Nile gradually
                    obstructed land-carriage, and El-Kamil, skilfully availing himself of this
                    natural ally, caused boats to be carried overland to the enemy’s rear, and, thus
                    cut off by land and water, they were compelled to attempt a retreat. At
                    Beyramoon, however, all further progress was found to be impossible, the
                    inundation had covered the level country, and the sultan’s boats blockaded the
                    Nile. The Franks surrendered, and evacuated Damietta, but not before Egypt had
                    suffered severely from the ravages they committed. The town of El-Mansoorah was
                    founded on the site of El-KamiΓs camp, and commemorates his energy and sagacity.
                    The Seventh Crusade was invited by the same sultan who had thus suffered by an
                    invasion of the Franks. In A.n. 1228, El-Kamil invoked the aid of Frederick II.

                    Jerusalem, with Bethlehem and the places between it and Joppa and Acre, Nazareth
                    and the territory of Thoron and Sidon, with its dependencies, was ceded to
                    Frederick on the 20th of Feb. 1229. Between these two monarchs existed the most
                    friendly relations, presenting a curious spectacle in the midst of the intrigues
                    and hatred of their subjects for each other, and endangering their popularity
                    and even their lives. After various expeditions against h ’ 's brother and his
                    successors, El-Kamil gained possession of Damascus, and died there in the year
                    635 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.p.</hi> 1238). lie was distinguished by military
                    talents and rare moderation, and was also a learned man, a patron of the arts,
                    and a good king.</p>
                <p>His son, El-Melik El-’Adil the Younger, was declared sultan of Egypt and Syria,
                    with the consent of the nobles, and he speedily banished those ministers whose
                    counsels he feared, and appointed creatures of his own. Oppressed by his
                    tyranny, and impoverished by his extravagance, the people called his brother
                    Es-Sâlih Negm-ed-Deen Eiyoob to the throne; and he deposed and imprisoned El-
                    ’Àdil in the year 637, and to replenish his exhausted treasury, ordered all who
                    had received presents from the late sultan to restore them to his successor. In
                    the next year serious disturbances nroke out in Syria; ’Imâd-ed-Deen, who had
                    taken Damascus in the reign of El-’Adil, formed an alliance with the Franks, and
                    purposed the conquest of Egypt; the hostile armies met at Acre, and the Muslim
                    soldiers of ’ Imad-ed-Deen deserting to the banner of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob, the
                    Franks were routed. Negotiations for peace were then attempted, but these
                    failing, the Franks were again induced to take the field by the cession of
                    Jerusalem and other places. The king of Egypt, on his part, called to his
                    assistance the Tatars of Kharesm, who took Jerusalem and overran Syria. In the
                    next campaign (642) they were joined by the army of Es-Sâlih, under the command
                    of his favourite slave Beybars, or Bibars, who was destined to play a
                    conspicuous part in Egyptian history. At Gaza the allied army met the Franks,
                    eager to avenge themselves on the Khares-mees for the horrible atrocities of
                    which they had been guilty in the preceding campaign, and willingly joined by
                    the Muslim princes of Damascus, Hirns, and Karak; on the first day the battle
                    raged with unabated fury from daybreak to sunset, and was continued on the
                    morrow until the prince of Hims, having lost 2000 men, gave way and fled towards
                    Damascus. The Christians maintained the unequal fight with great constancy, and
                    were only vanquished after the greater number had fallen. In these encounters
                    30,000 men (Christians and Muslims) were either killed or taken prisoners.
                    Various successes followed this victory, Jerusalem was taken by the Egyptians,
                    and Es-Sâlih laid siege to Damascus in person. The city having capitulated on
                    favourable conditions, his fierce allies, enraged at the loss of pillage,
                    quarrelled with him, and soon after joined his rebellious subjects. Damascus was
                    reduced to the direst straits, but again fortune favoured Es-Sâlih. He hastened
                    from Egypt, whither he had returned, and totally defeated the enemy. Other
                    advantages were gained by his commander Fakhr-ed-Deen over the Franks in
                    645.</p>
                <p>Although attacked by illness, the sultan was once more called to Syria to quell
                    fresh troubles; but at Damascus news reached him of the threatened invasion of
                    Egypt by the Crusaders under St Louis, and he travelled back in great suffering
                    from his malady. Darnietta, which he rightly judged would be the first point of
                    attack, was strengthened and well stored, and its defence was intrusted to
                    Fakhr-ed-Deen. On Friday, June 4, A.υ. 1249, the French anchored before the
                    place, and the. next day landed opposite the camp of the Egyptian general, who
                    offered but slight opposition, and in the course of the next night betrayed his
                    trust and retreated southwards. His army was precipitately followed by the
                    entire population of Darnietta, and this important town with its stores fell
                    into the hands of the invaders without a blow. Fakhr-ed-Deen nearly lost his
                    life for this act of cowardice, and fifty-four of his principal officers were
                    put to death. In the meantime the sultan’s illness gradually increased, but
                    nevertheless he caused himself to be removed to the town of El-Mansoorah, which
                    he fortified, and there he expired on Nov. 21, at the age of forty-four, and
                    after a reign of ten years. He it was who introduced the Bahree Memlooks, a body
                    of Turkish slaves, who composed his body-guard, and eventually usurped the
                    supreme power. Their name <hi rend="italic">Bahree</hi> (or “of the river ”)
                    originated in their being trained and quartered on the island of Er-Rodah, where
                    the sultan had built a palace.</p>
                <p>The French were advancing southwards, and, notwithstanding the precautions of
                    Sheger-ed-Durr (the widow of Es-Sâlih, who assumed the regency^), were apprised
                    of the death of the sultan. Many partial actions took place on the march, and on
                    Dec. 19, their army appeared before El-Mansoorah, the scene of the disaster of
                    Jean de Brienne. Skirmishing continued until Shrove Tuesday, when, a traitor
                    having shown the enemy a ford over the canal of Ashmoon, they surprised the camp
                    and town. Very severe fighting ensued, Fakhr-ed-Deen fell early in the struggle,
                    and the place was nearly lost, when the Bahree Memlooks led by Beybars furiously
                    charged the assailants, and completely turned the fortune of the day. The morrow
                    witnessed another battle, also disastrous to the Crusaders, .and a succession of
                    misfortunes followed. Tooran-Shdh, on hearing of the death of his father,
                    travelled in all haste from Mesopotamia to Egypt, and having reached the camp
                    assumed the command. He had recourse to the stratagem which had proved so
                    successful under the direction of El-Kâmil, and cut off the supplies of the
                    enemy. This, coupled with disease, soon reduced St Louis to great straits, and
                    he sent to propose a truce, but not coming to terms he resolved on retreating to
                    Darnietta. A memorable conflict took place by land and water, and St Louis with
                    lιis troops surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</p>
                <p>Toorân-Shâh now gave himself up to debauchery, offended his nobles by bestowing
                    his favours only on certain creatures whom he had brought with him from
                    Mesopotamia, and alarmed the queen by forcing her to render him an account of
                    his father’s wealth. Sheger-ed-Durr appealed to the Memlooks, a conspiracy was
                    formed, and the sultan was attacked in bis palace. He fled to a pleasuretower
                    built on the banks of the Nile, which was set on fire in the presence of his
                    army, the wretched king, from the summit, in vain promising to abdicate. He
                    perished miserably, an&lt;l his corpse lay unburied for many days on the bank.
                    On his accession he had strangled a brother, and his fate deserves no pity.</p>
                <p>Sheger-ed-Durr (vulgarly called Shegeret-ed-Durr), herself a slave, and the first
                    of the Dynasty of the Bahree, or Turkish Memlooks, succeeded to the throne; and
                    ’ Izz-ed Deen Eybek was appointed commander of the forces. After many delays, St
                    Louis agreed to pay 400,000 livres as a ransom for himself and his army, 200,000
                    to be paid in Egypt, and the remainder on the fulfilment of certain stipulations
                    at Acre: Darnietta was surrendered and Egypt evacuated. Thus ended the last
                    invasion of Egypt by the Crusaders. Sheger-ed-Durr, in order to strengthen
                    herself on the throne, shortly after married the emcer Eybek, and caused him to
                    be proclaimed sultan, with the title of El-Melik El-Mo’izz, in the year 648. The
                    followers of the late Es-Sâlih, however, obliged Eybek to associate with himself
                    in the sovereignty a young prince of the family of Eiyoob, El-Melik El-Ashraf
                    MudhafΓar-ed-Deen Moosà. En-Nasir, a son of El-’Azeez, invaded Egypt, and after
                    many combats was driven back to Syria, but the country continued in a very
                    unsettled state. The chief of the adherents of the fallen dynasty was arrested
                    by Eybek; and Beybars and other leading men having repaired to the citadel to
                    demand satisfaction, his bloody head was thrown to them from the ramparts, and
                    in terror they fled to Syria. El-Ashraf was then cast into prison, and there he
                    died. But Eybek soon roused the jealousy of his beautiful and ambitious wife;
                    and lie was assassinated by her orders (655, A.D. 1257). In her turn she was
                    beaten to death, not many days after, by the wooden clogs of the female slaves
                    of another wife of Eybek, and her corpse was exposed for three days in the moat
                    of the citadel.</p>
                <p>El-Melik El-Mansoor Noor-ed-Dcen ’Alee, son of Eybek, was now raised to the
                    throne, and Beybars being apprised of the death of his rival attempted to regain
                    his power in Egypt; but Kutz, the viceroy of Eybek and also of his son, attacked
                    and routed him; and he soon after (657) desposed El-Mansoor, and declared
                    himself sultan. El-Melik El-Mudhaffar Kutz began his reign by putting to death
                    El-Mansoor and Sharaf-ed-Deen, the able minister of the last Eiyoobee kings and
                    of the first of this dynasty. A reign thus cruelly commenced ended tragically.
                    Kutz was diverted from these severe measures by the advance of Hoolâgoo,
                    grandson of Genghis-Khân, who, with a formidable army, overran El-’Irâk and
                    Syria. By great efforts Kutz raised a considerable force and marched to meet
                    him. The intelligence of the death of the Moghul emperor had, however, in the
                    meantime recalled Hoolâgoo, who left Ketboogha to encounter the Egyptian sultan.
                    The battle declared in favour of the latter, and Syria was restored to his rule.
                    Returning in triumph to Egypt, he was assassinated on the frontier by Beybars in
                    the year 658, and this Memlook (who had but recently fought under his banner
                    against the Tatars) was forthwith chosen by the emeers to be his successor.</p>
                <p>The brilliant reign of El-Melik Edh-Dhâhir Beybars El-Bun-dukdâree is so
                    perplexed and full of incident as to render a concise account of it very
                    difficult. It began with the reduction of a revolt in Syria. The rebels were
                    supported by a Tatar army under Hoolâgoo, but Beybars was everywhere victorious,
                    ar.d Damascus surrendered at discretion. Having subdued all opposition in this
                    quarter, he endeavoured to improve the condition of Egypt, abolished the
                    exorbitant imposts under which the people groaned, and welcomed to the court
                    Ahmad, son of the caliph Edh-Dhâhir, who was declared Prince of the Faithful
                    with the title of El-Mustansir bi-llâh, and-furnished with a small force, by
                    which he hoped to establish himself in Baghdad. He was, however, repulsed by the
                    Tatars and put to death. The succeeding line of caliphs, possessed of spiritual,
                    but no temporal authority, remained at the court of the Memlook sultans until
                    the Turkish conquest. From this time, Beybars continued to extend and confirm
                    his rule. Ilis first expedition was to Syria agaiust the Christians, and the
                    Church of the Nativity at Nazareth was destroyed. Thence he went to the
                    fortified town of Karak, which had more than once resisted the attacks of
                    Saladin, but opened its gates to the Memlook conqueror.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0779-0756"/>
                <p>and its territory was added to his dominions. À grept scarcity afflicted Cairo in
                    662, and Beybars threw open the Government stores, and strove in every way to
                    alleviate the sufferings of his subjects.</p>
                <p>In 663 he again entered Syria, and took Caesarea and Ursoof; and in the next year
                    he commenced a series of campaigns against the Christians, notwithstanding the
                    earnest remonstrances of the kings of France, of Aragon, and of Armenia. To
                    raise the necessary funds for the expenses of the war, he took occasion from the
                    occurrence of many incendiary fires in Cairo, during his absence, to mulct their
                    co-religionists of the sum of 500,000 deenars, ostensibly to repair the damage
                    caused by these fires. He threatened Acre, and took Safad; and relieved from the
                    apprehensions caused by the advance of the Tatars by the death of Hoolâgoo and
                    the retreat of his army, Beybars despatched a force which effected the conquest
                    of Armenia, and penetrated to the borders of Anatolia, a transient success which
                    was speedily annulled by the advent of Abâkâ Khan, the son of Hoolâgoo. In the
                    next war, Beybars again attacked the Christians, burning their churches and
                    enslaving the people. He took Antioch, with horrible carnage, advanced to Hims
                    and Hamah, and thence returned to Cairo. After a campaign against the Tatars, he
                    ravaged the country around Acre (the constant object of his attacks), and the
                    “Assassins,” so long the terror of dynasties, submitted to his power. About this
                    time the Tatars renewed their inroads and besieged Beyrah; and in the year 671
                    Beybars took the field against them with two armies, one commanded by himself in
                    person, the other by Kalâ-oon El-Elfee. In the battle of Beyrah the sultan was
                    completely victorious, and the Tatars fled to the mountains of Kurdistan. In
                    consequence of this victory, Armenia again fell into his hands, and was given up
                    to pillage. Abâkâ Kinin afterwards was again repulsed at Beyrah. N ubia also
                    about this time acknowledged the authority of Beybars. He died at Damascus in
                    the year 676, after another expedition against Anatolia, attended with various
                    success, in which the Tatars were leagued against him. Great military talents,
                    coupled with the most indefatigable activity, Beybars certainly possessed, but
                    he used his conquests unmercifully; on many occasions he ravaged whole
                    provinces, and sacked many towns, putting great numbers of the inhabitants to
                    the sword. The melancholy annals of the Crusades bear ample testimony to this
                    fact; and while the example of other monarchs, and of the Franks themselves, may
                    be urged as some palliation, nevertheless his barbarity remains an indelible
                    blot on his character. In Egypt he endeavoured to reform abuses and suppress
                    vice; and numerous public works were executed by his orders. Damietta was razed
                    and rebuilt farther inland; and the mouth of the Nile was protected by a boom
                    against sudden invasion. He repaired the fortifications of Alexandria and the
                    Pharos, the mosque El-Azhar in Cairo, and the walls of the citadel, and built
                    the great mosque known by his name to the north of the city.</p>
                <p>The son and successor of Beybars, El-Melik Es-Sa’eed Barakeh Khan, was exiled
                    after a short reign of two years, and a younger brother El-’Ädil Selâmish,
                    raised to the throne, Kalâ-oon El-Elfee acting as regent. This Memlook had
                    married a daughter of Beybars, and was consequently nearly allied to the sultan.
                    He nevertheless conspired against him, and was soon proclaimed king by the title
                    of El-Melik El-Mansoor. Distinguished in former wars, he achieved many successes
                    during his reign of ten years. On his accession he despatched an army to reduce
                    disturbances in Syria, and took Damascus. Peace was thus established in that
                    province; and in the year 680 he in person defeated a very superior force of
                    Tatars and raised the siege of Rahabeh. Later in his reign (in the year 688) he
                    besieged Tripoli, which for nearly two centuries had been in the possession of
                    the Christians and was very rich and flourishing. The town was sacked and its
                    unfortunate inhabitants put to the sword. His memoιy is still preserved in Cairo
                    by his hospital and mad-house adjoining his fine mosque in the principal street
                    of the city. This charitable institution he is said to have founded as an
                    expiation for great severity towards the citizens in enforcing an obnoxious
                    edict. His son, El-Ashτaf Khaleel, rendered himself famous by the siege and
                    capture (in the year 690) of Acre, the last stronghold of the Crusaders in
                    Syria. Many thousands of its inhabitants were massacred; and 10,000 who
                    presented themselves before the sultan and demanded quarter were slaughtered in
                    cold blood. He also took Erzeroom in 691, and two years after was assassinated
                    in Egypt <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1294).</p>
                <p>El-Melik En-Nâsir Mohammad, another son of Kalâ-oon, succeeded him at the age of
                    nine years. The regent Ketbooghà, however, followed the example of Kalâ-oon, and
                    usurped the (sovereignty, with the title El-Melik El-’Adil. Pestilence and
                    famine were followed by war with the Tatars, who again ravaged Syria. Ketbooghà
                    despatched an army against them, but the valour of bis troops was unable to
                    withstand overpowering numbers, and lAgeert, Kalâ-oon’s governor in Syria, was
                    driven into Egypt with an immense crowd of fugitives. Ketbooghà was deposed on
                    the allegation that he had not commanded in person, and El-Melik El-Mansoor
                    Lâgeen was elevated in his stead. In little more than two years this king was
                    deposed in a conspiracy. I lis character was amiable, and he deserved a better
                    return for the equity and kindness he showed to his subjects.</p>
                <p>A short period of confusion then ensued, during which an emeer was proclaimed
                    king. En-Nasir Mohammad, however, was at length recalled from his exile at
                    Karak, and restored in the year 698. Having firmly established himself in Egypt,
                    he led an army against the Tatars, but met with a severe reverse in the plains
                    of Hims; a second expedition proved more fortunate, and En-Nasir, then only
                    nineteen years of age, gained a bloody and decisive victory over the enemy near
                    Damascus, in the year 702. The battle lasted three days; during the first two
                    the result was not decisive, although En-Nâsir held the field; on the third day
                    the Tatars were utterly routed and pursued for many hours. The sultan on his
                    entry into Cairo after this achievement was preceded by 1600 prisoners, each one
                    carrying the head of a comrade slain in the combat, and 1000 other heads were
                    borne on lances in the procession. En-Nasir reigned until the year 707, when he
                    went to Karak and voluntarily abdicated. He had long struggled against the
                    control of two powerful emeers, Beybars and Silâr; and in despair of throwing
                    off their ascendency, he then openly yielded the reins of government to those
                    who had long really held them. Since this prince’s accession the Christians and
                    Jews of Egypt suffered the most severe persecution (excepting that of El-Hâkim)
                    which had yet befallen them. In the year 700, they were ordered to wear blue and
                    yellow turbans respectively, and forbidden to ride on horses or mules, or to
                    receive any Government employment. The people took advantage of these measures
                    to destroy many churches and synagogues. The churches continued shut for about a
                    year; but some of those which had been destroyed wore afterwards rebuilt at the
                    request of Lascaris and other princes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    period was a great earthquake which half ruined Cairo, giving it the appearance
                    of a city demolished by a siege; Alexandria and other towns of Egypt, as well as
                    Syria, also suffered from it considerably.</p>
                <p>On the abdication of En-Nâsir, El-Melik El-Mudhaffar Rukn-ed-Deen Beybars II. was
                    saluted sultan; but ere long En-Nâsir recovered his courage, and having
                    collected an army marched to Damascus, where he was acknowledged, and thence to
                    Egypt, entering Cairo without opposition. El-Mudhaffar had fled at his approach,
                    and, never a favourite of the people, he was attacked on his exit from the
                    metropolis, by a crowd of the citizens, who loaded him with abuse, and pelted
                    him with stones. El-Nâsir now for the third time ascended the throne of Egypt,
                    and took the entire authority into his own hands. The remainder of his life was
                    a period of profound peace, during which he occupied himself in improving his
                    dominions, and in embellishing Cairo. But another persecution of the Christians
                    occurred in 721, and all the principal churches in Egypt were destroyed by
                    certain fanatical Moslems. The sultan threatened a general massacre of the
                    inhabitants of Cairo and El-Fustât; the Christians, however, took revenge
                    themselves by setting fire to very many mosques and houses in the metropolis;
                    much tumult ensued, and many Christians and Muslims were executed. The threats
                    of the mob induced En-Nâsir to permit the people to murder and plunder any
                    Christian whom they might meet in the streets; and the oppressive rules before
                    enacted were rigorously enforced, and made even more degrading.</p>
                <p>The sons of En-Nâsir followed him in succession, but the reigns of most of them
                    were short and troublous. El-Mansoor Seyf-ed-Deen Aboo-Bekr, El-Ashraf
                    ’Alâ-ed-Deen Koojυok, En-Nâsir Shihâb-ed.Deen Ahmad, Es-Sâlih ’Imâd-ed-Deen
                    Ismâ’eel, El-Kâmil Zeyn-ed-Deen Shâabân, and El-Mudhaffar Zeyii-ed-Deen Ilâggee
                    were only raised to the throne to be either exiled or put to death. After these,
                    the sultan Hasan deserves notice. He was deposed by his brother, Es-Sâlih
                    Salâh-ed-Deen, whose minister was Sheykhoon, a man well known to students of
                    Egyptian subjects; but he soon regained his authority, reigned seven years, and
                    at length fell by the swords of his memlooks in the splendid mosque which he
                    built in the open space beneath the citadel of Cairo. Four more Memlook kings
                    bring the history to the accession of a new dynasty. These were El-Mansoor
                    Nâsir-ed-Deen Hâggee (son of El-Mudhaffar), deposed in six months; El-Ashraf
                    Shâabân (son of Hasan), an unfortunate prince, whose reign passed away amid the
                    intrigues of the <hi rend="italic">fainéant</hi> caliphs and the struggles of
                    the now too powerful emeers,by whom he was ultimately strangled; his son,
                    El-Mansoor ’Alâ-ed-Deen, the victim of similar troubles, in whose time the
                    celebrated Barkook rose to the regency; and Es-Sâlih Hâggee, a brother of the
                    last king. Exiled by Barkook, who was proclaimed sultan, he unsuccessfully
                    endeavoured to recover his throne in the year 784; in 790 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.d.</hi> 1388) he was restored, but he was soon once more dethroned, this
                    time with the loss of his life.</p>
                <p>The sultan Edh-Dhähir Seyf-ed-Deen Aboo-Sa’eed Barkook was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0780-0757"/> now undisputed master of Egypt. He was the first
                    prince of the Dynasty of Burgee or Circassian Memlooks. As the preceding dynasty
                    was founded by the Turkish Memlooks of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob, so this dynasty was
                    composed of the Circassian slaves rvhom those kings from time to time bought
                    with the view of strengthening their power. They were originally placed in
                    garrison-towns, and hence their name <hi rend="italic">Burgee,</hi> signifying
                    “of a tower or castle.” It is worthy of remark that, while many of the sultans
                    of both these dynasties held an insecure tenure of power, many of the former met
                    with a violent death, but few of the latter. The reign of Barkook is memorable
                    for his war with Teemoor, or Teemoor-leng, commonly called by us Tamerlane, who
                    had extended his conquests towards his dominions, but found him not unprepared,
                    for he had foreseen the threatened danger. In the year 795, Karà-Yoosuf, lord of
                    El-Medeeyeh, and Ahmad Ibn-Uweys, sultan of Baghdad, lied to his court for
                    succour. The inhabitants of Edessa had been l&gt;ut to the sword, and Aleppo was
                    menaced with a similar catastrophe, when Barkook at the head of his army came to
                    its relief. Ahmad was reinstated in Baghdad, as a vassal of Barkook; and soon
                    after the’Otlimâulee Bâyezeed, commonly called by us Bajazet, concluded a treaty
                    with the sultan of Egypt. His designs against India diverted Teemoor from his
                    projects in Syria, but Barkook continued vigilant and by every means sought to
                    insure the safety of his kingdom. He died suddenly in 801, much beloved by his
                    subjects and regarded by less powerful chiefs as their strongest bulwark against
                    the Tatar monarch. He was called “Sheykh” for his wisdom and learning, and
                    combined with these qualities those of a skilful general and a good king. He was
                    active, wary, and provident, and possessed the military talents of Beybars
                    without his severity. He seems to have been fond of riches and display, and he
                    certainly left his treasury in a very nourishing condition, besides much wealth
                    in stores, slaves, horses, and the like.</p>
                <p>His son, El-Mclik En-Nâsir Abu-s-Sa’âdât Farag, fell a prey to intestine troubles
                    and the inroads of the invader. He had overcome a revolt of the governor of
                    Syria, when Teemoor again threatened that province. Karà-Yoosuf and Ahmad sought
                    refuge with the son of their former protector, and Farag’s refusing to betray
                    his guests gave occasion to the enemy to continue the war; a battle was fought,
                    Farag was defeated, Aleppo and l·Iims fell into the hands of the victor, and the
                    Egyptian forces returned and were concentrated in Egypt. Intimidated, however,
                    by the fall of his ally Bajazet, Farag sent an embassy to Teemoor with presents
                    and offers of amity, and at length concluded a peace at the sacrifice of
                    territory. Teemoor died in the year 807 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1405),
                    and Farag was preparing an expedition to recover his Syrian possessions, when he
                    was surprised in his palace by an insurrection, headed by his brother,
                    ’Abd-el-’Azecz, and compelled to take to flight. The people believing that he
                    had perished proclaimed El-Maιτsoor ’Abd-el-’Azeez his successor. In the space
                    of less than three months, however, he was deposed in favour of Farag, who
                    thenceforth reigned at Damascus, until the caliph El-Musta’een bi-llah, at the
                    instigation of the emeer Sheykh El-Mahmoodee, who had raised an army, boldly
                    declared himself sultan, by an appeal to religion gained numbers to his side,
                    instituted criminal proceedings against Farag on the plea of the exactions which
                    lie had been forced to levy for the conduct of the war against Teemoor, and
                    accomplished his death. Farag was beheaded in the month of Safar in the year
                    815, and his corpse was left unburied. Abu-l-Mahasin gives him the character of
                    an extravagant, cruel, and voluptuous king..</p>
                <p>El-Musta’een bi-llah, with the title of El-Melik El-’Ädil Abu-1- Fadl, began his
                    reign well; but he had appointed El-Mahmoodee his vizir as a reward for his
                    services, and this powerful and vigorous chief soon obliged him to abdicate and
                    eventually exiled him to Alexandria, where he passed the remainder of his
                    days.</p>
                <p>El-Melik El-Mu-eiyad Abu-n-Nasr Sheykh El-Mahmoodee "(originally a memlook of
                    Barkook’s) waged three successful wars in Syria, in the first of which he was
                    guilty of a breach of faith in putting to death the governor of Damascus and
                    part of the garrison of that city, after they had surrendered on promise of
                    safety. He reigned peacefully in Egypt, and his name is recorded as that of a
                    king who studied the happiness of his subjects and favoured the learned, who
                    counted him among their number. But he was avaricious; although one might judge
                    the contrary from his beautiful mosque and the minarets oyer the Bâb-Zuweyleh in
                    Cairo, held to be among the chief ornaments of the city.</p>
                <p>Three kings followed in rapid succession :—El-MudhafTar Ahmad, a son of
                    El-Mu-eiyad, under two years of age at his accession, Edh-Dhahir Tatar, and his
                    infant son, Es-Sâlih Mohammad, who was deposed by Barsâbay Ed-Dukmâkee. This
                    Memlook assumed the title of El-Melik El-Ashraf, and worthily continued the
                    prosperous reign of El-Mu-eiyad. In power and virtue he ranks second only to
                    Barkook among all the kings of this dynasty. He is known in European history by
                    his expedition in 827 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1424) against John III.,
                    king of Cyprus, who became his vassal, and by the part he took, about seven
                    years later, in the dissensions of the house of Savoy and the government of
                    Cyprus. He ruled for seventeen years with great clemency, and died in 841.
                    El-’Azcez Yoosuf, his son, was deposed by El-Mansoor Aboo-Sa’eed Jakmak
                    El-’Ala-ee, a good prince, and a patron of the learned. After a peaceful reign
                    he abdicated at the age of about eighty years in favour of his son, El-Mansoor
                    Abu-s-Sa’âdât Otlimân, who was overthrown by the intrigues of the caliph El-Kâïm
                    bi-amri-llâh, and was succeeded by an aged Memlook, El-Ashraf-Abu-n-Nasr Eynal,
                    followed by his son, El-Mu-eiyad Shihab-ed-Deen Abu-1- Fet-h Ahmad. Edh-Dhâhir
                    Seyf-ed-Deen-Khoslikadam, a Greek by birth, superseded him, reigning himself for
                    seven years, with equity and benignity, presenting a contrast to the cruelty and
                    oppression of his appointed successor, Ed-Dhahir Aboo-Sa’eed Bilbây El-Alâ-ee,
                    which caused the latter's fall and the elevation of the sultan Aboo-Sa’eed
                    Temerbeg Edh-Dhahiree, who, in his turn, was deposed to make room for El-Ashraf
                    Kâït Bey, a prince who deserves especial notice for his struggles with the
                    Turks, whereby the conquest of Egypt by the Porte was deferred for a few years.
                    After a period of quiet which followed his accession, he was alarmed by the
                    victory gained by Mehemet II. over his ally the king of Persia, and posted a
                    considerable force on the frontier of Syria. The successes of the conqueror of
                    Constantinople made him desire to abdicate; but the emeers prayed him to defend
                    his rights, and he consequently prepared for the war. The death of Mehemet, and
                    the dissensions between Bajazet II. and Jem (or Zizim) temporarily relieved him
                    of these apprehensions. The fall of Jem, however, and his arrival at the
                    Egyptian court, implicated the Memlook sultan in the quarrel; and on the final
                    overthrow of this prince Kâït Bey made sure of a war with the more fortunate
                    Bajazet, and himself began aggressive measures, intercepted the Turkish caravan
                    of pilgrims, and an ambassador from India who was on his way to Constantinople
                    with presents, and took Tarsus and Adaneh. A remonstrance from Bajazet was
                    answered by a successful attack on his Asiatic commander, ’Alâ-ed-Dowleh. In the
                    meantime Tarsus and Adaneh were recovered from him; but the emeer El-Ezbekee, to
                    whom was entrusted the conduct of all future wars, being despatched against
                    these towns, retook them, defeated an army sent to chastise him, and annexed
                    Karamania. Another force was speedily equipped, and took the field in 893;
                    conditions of peace were refused, and considerable success attended the Turkish
                    arms. El-Ezbekee was, therefore, again ordered to Syria; a Turkish squadron
                    conveying troops was dispersed, and at Tarsus he gave battle. The result was at
                    first unfavourable to the Memlooks, whose commander, however, rallied them under
                    cover of the night, and succeeded in surprising and totally defeating the Turks.
                    Long negotiations followed this victory; and at length Kâït Bey, who was always
                    most anxious for peace, ceded the disputed towns of Tarsus and Adaneh, and
                    secured repose during the rest of his days. He died in 901, having designated
                    El-Melik En-Nâsir Abu-s-Sa’âdât Mohammad as his successor. This weak and
                    barbarous king was put to death after four years, during which he was deposed,
                    and Kânsooh, surnamed Khamsameeyeh, and Edh-Dhâhir Abu-n-Nasr Kânsooh were
                    successively installed. The first reigned but eleven days, and the latter
                    abdicated after five months of great dilliculty and danger. On the death of
                    En-Nâsir, El-Ashraf Kânsooh Jânbalât was elevated to the throne, but six months
                    sufficed to accomplish bis fall, and he was Jortunate in preserving his life.
                    The next sultan, El-Melik El-’Adil Too-mân Bey, was acknowledged both in Egypt
                    and Syria. He, however, was overthrown and killed in a few months.</p>
                <p>The Memlooks now compelled Kânsooh EI-Ghoorec to assume the dangerous dignity,
                    with the title of El-Melik El-Ashraf. This prince very unwillingly yielded. His
                    previous life shows him to have been both virtuous and learned; and he proved
                    himself to be an able ruler. After an unsuccessful expedition against the
                    Portuguese in the East, he reigned in peace until the year 915, when Kurkood,
                    the father of Selim I., the Turkish sultan, obtained his protection and
                    assistance. Events similar to those which accompanied the end of Jem followed;
                    and Selim availed himself of a pretext to declare war against Egypt. The first
                    reverse which the Egyptians suffered occurred to an army commanded by
                    ΆΙά-ed-Dowleh, formerly defeated by Kâït Bey, but now in the pay of El-Ghooree.
                    The winter was passed by the latter in preparing energetically for the
                    inevitable struggle, and in the spring he advanced in person. Selim, on his
                    part, pretended to march towards Persia; but at the same time he sent to demand
                    of EI-Ghooree wherefore he opposed his passage and commanded in person on the
                    frontier. El-Ghooree replied that his was merely an army of observation, and
                    that he was desirous of mediating between Selim and Ismâ’eel Shâh. Selim,
                    however, rapidly advanced, refused to listen to an attempt at negotiation, and
                    was met by El-Ghooree on the plain of Marj-Dâbik, near Aleppo. A long and
                    sanguinary battle ensued, and victory declared for neither side, until Kheyr
                    Bey, commanding the right wing, .and El-Ghazâlee the left, of the Egyptian army,
                    basely deserted to the enemy with their troops. The centre then gave way and
                    fled in utter confusion, notwithstanding the efforts of the sultan to rally
                    them. He was trampled to death by his routed cavalry, while (according to some)

                <p>This event took place on the 26th of Regeb 922 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi>
                    1516). With his death Egypt lost her independence. The shattered remains of the
                    army collected in Cairo. Tooman Bey, a nephew of the deceased king, was elected
                    snltan, and at once determined on every resistance to the conqueror. His general
                    in Syria, El-Ganbardee, disputed the road with Selim step by step, and Tooman
                    Bey awaited his arrival near Cairo. Between El-Khankah and the metropolis, at
                    the village of Er-Reydaneeyeh, the opposing armies joined battle, on the 29th of
                    Zu-l-Heggeh (January 1, 1517). The fall of a favourite general, Sinan Pasha,
                    infuriated the Turks, and the brilliant bravery of the Memlooks availed them
                    not. Immense numbers of them were slain by their enemies in the pursuit, and the
                    survivors reunited in Cairo. El-Ganbardee, however, sacrificed his fame by
                    joining the victor. The Turkish army paused for rest; and time was thus given to
                    Tooman Bey to hire Arabs at a great cost to replenish his thinned ranks. Selim
                    now passed to the west of Cairo. A night surprise conducted by Tooman failed,
                    but he succeeded in putting to the sword a great many Turks. He fortified
                    himself in the city, and a house-to-house combat ensued, the Memlooks defending
                    every foot with the energy of despair; the citadel fell by assault, and the
                    unfortunate Tooman effected his escape towards Alexandria; but on the way he was
                    taken by Arabs, given up to El-Ganbardee and another, and brought in chains to
                    Selim, who at first received him with honour, but afterwards falsely accused him
                    of conspiring against him, and, with the cruelty and perfidy characteristic of
                    his race, hung him over the Bäb-Zuweyleh, the pjace of execution for common
                    malefactors. Thus miserably perished the last independent ruler of Egypt, who
                    possessed the best qualities of his line, and whose noble defence of his kingdom
                    would have secured to him the commiseration of any but a Turk.</p>
                <p>In reviewing the period during which Egypt was governed by independent Muslim
                    princes, it is necessary to consider the spirit of the times and the people over
                    whom they ruled. They succeeded to the government of countries worn out by
                    incessant warfare, overrun by savage hordes, and debased by the rule of the
                    Lower Empire. Egypt had long struggled against the slavery to which it was
                    condemned, and the history of the last three dynasties of Pharaohs evincee the
                    patriotism which yet animated her people. But the successive tyranny of the
                    Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans appears to have annihilated their
                    nationality; and when the Arabs invaded the country, these causes, combined with
                    religious strife, induced the people to afford to the conquerors every
                    assistance in their power. But the changeful rule of the lieutenants and the
                    troubles of the caliphs debarred Egypt (except at times under the Benee-Tooloon
                    and the Ikhsheedeeyeh) from profiting by the enlightenment of the race who held
                    the dominion over it, until the conquest by the Fàtimees. The caliphs of that
                    dynasty contributed in a great degree to restore to Egypt some portion of its
                    ancient prosperity, and with the house of Eiyoob it attained its greatest
                    military glory under the Muslims; but the edifices erected during the rule of
                    the two dynasties of Memlook kings, the libraries collected in Cairo at that
                    period, and the learned men who then flourished would point to it as the age in
                    which literature and the arts were cultivated with the most success, a sure
                    evidence of the internal prosperity of any country. This is the more surprising
                    when we consider the state of Syria, which had long before their accession
                    fallen a prey to intestine wars and the ravages of the Tatars, the Crusaders,
                    and other invaders, and also bear in mind the constitution of their government,
                    in which the more powerful chiefs were constantly aiming at the supreme
                    authority; and the practice of purchasing memlooks, and rearing them in the
                    households of the great to enable their masters to maintain their ascendency
                    augmented the number of these aspirants to the throne. These slaves were, unlike
                    the Bahrees (who were the Turkish Memlooks of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob), chiefly
                    Circassians, who afterwards composed the Second (or Burgee) Dynasty. Many of the
                    Memlook sultans rivalled in military achievements the great Saladin, and even
                    penetrated further than he in their foreign expeditions. In Cairo are etill seen
                    the finest specimens of Arab architecture, almost ail dating during the period
                    comprised under the domination of the two Memlook dynasties; the libraries of
                    the mosques, and the private collections of that city, though grievously injured
                    since the Turkish conquest, are or very recently were the best and most
                    considerable of those of Egypt or Syria;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It should, however, be mentioned that many of the most
                    precious of their contents are plunder brought from tiιe libraries of mosques in
                    Syria, as is proved by seals which they bear.</p></note> and, as before
                    remarked, the university El-Λzhar is still, owing to the fostering care of these
                    sultans, the principal seat of learning of the Eastern world. In this sketch of
                    the history of Egypt we have given no account of the state of commerce,
                    taxation, &amp;c., under the Muslims. Those only who have read the Arab
                    histories of this and other Eastern countries can appreciate the general fallacy
                    of the conclusions based on their authority.</p>
                <p>It would be tedious and unprofitable to follow the details of Turkish misrule and
                    tyranny which are from this time presented to the student of Egyptian history.
                    Although Selim had apparently destroyed the power of the Memlooks, he thought it
                    wise to conciliate them, and to appoint twenty-four beys over the military
                    provinces of that number into which he divided Egypt, subject to the supreme
                    control of a pasha, whose council was formed of seven Turkish chiefs (ôjàklees),
                    while one of the beys held the post of Sheykh el-Beled, or Governor of the
                    Metropolis, an officer who became an object of hatred to the other chiefs. This
                    system was begun by Selim, and completed by his successor. For nearly two
                    centuries the successive pashas were mostly obeyed; but the ambition of becoming
                    Sheykh el-Beled was the fruitful cause of intrigue and murder. The Memlooks who
                    then held power in Egypt were called the Ghuzz, that being the name of the tribe
                    to which they are said to have at first generally belonged; and they continually
                    bought slaves, of Circassian or Georgian race, to supply the place of children,
                    for they did not intermarry with natives of Egypt, and women of more northern
                    climates are generally either barren or bear sickly offspring in that country.
                    Thus they lacked the surest source of power; few possessed any family ties; but
                    at the same time the slaves in general were remarkably faithful to their
                    patrons. After two centuries, the beys gradually increased in power, until the
                    authority of the pasha was almost nominal, and the government became a military
                    oligarchy. This brings us to the rise of the celebrated Ali Bey. He was created
                    Sheykh el-Beled in A.H. 1177; but, having revenged himself on an old enemy who
                    had assassinated Ali’s master, to whom he owed his elevation to the rank of bey,
                    he shortly after fled to Syria, and took refuge with the governor of Jerusalem,
                    and thence went to Acre, where the Sheykh Dlιahir became his friend; and that
                    same year he returned to Cairo in his former capacity of Sheykh el-Beled. In
                    1179 his enemies again compelled him to flee, and he betook himself this time to
                    El-Yemen, once more to return to Egypt; after which he gained increased power.
                    His favourite memlook, Mohammad Aboo-Dhahab, proved ungrateful, and, while
                    enjoying the highest power, entered into a conspiracy against his life; but
                    after receiving the presents of the hostile beys, he denounced them to his
                    master, who would not listen to warnings of his meditated treachery.</p>
                <p>In the year 1182 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1768) the Porte demanded the
                    assistance of Ali Bey in the Russian war, an order which he was about to obey,
                    when he was apprised of the departure of a messenger with a firmàn demanding his
                    head, he having been falsely accused at Constantinople of intending to aid the
                    Russians and throw off his allegiance. He caused the bearer of this order to be
                    waylaid and put to death, and having possessed himself of the firmàn, he
                    convened<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0782-0759"/> the beys, showed them the document, and aided by
                    those of his own household persuaded the council to expel the pasha, and declare
                    Egypt independent. The Sheykh Dhâhir took part in this rebellion, and the pasha
                    of Damascus was beaten by him between Mount Lebanon and Tiberias. A period of
                    good but vigorous government and of tranquillity followed these events in Egypt,
                    notwithstanding the very heavy imposts levied for the replenishment of the
                    treasury; and Ali’s generals gained for him extended power abroad. Mohammad
                    Aboo-Dhahab was despatched to Arabia, and entered Mecca, where the Shereef was
                    deposed; and another bey traversed the eastern shores of the Red Sea. After the
                    expedition to Arabia, Mohammad Bey marched into Syria to assist the Sheykh
                    Dhâhir against the Porte, and the co-operation of the Russians was demanded. A
                    successful campaign terminated before the walls of Damascus, the siege of which
                    was abandoned when nearly brought to a close, and Mohammad Bey returned with
                    large forces to Egypt. This man, loaded with benefits by his patron, now openly
                    rebelled; and being joined by Ali’s enemies, at the head of whom was Ismail,
                    chief of the guard, he advanced on Cairo, and Aii escaped to his steady ally,
                    Sheykh Dhâhir, the prince of Acre. These events took place the year 1186.
                    Mohammad Bey was then declared Sheykh el-Beled. Ali Bey, in the meanwhile, in
                    conjunction with his ally, gained various advantages in Syria, and, on the
                    information that his return was desired in Egypt, he collected a small force,
                    assisted by Sheykh Dhâhir and a Russian squadron, and determined on attempting
                    to recover his power. He, however, fell into an ambuscade near Es-Sâliheeyeh,
                    and was wounded by one of his memlooks named Murâd (afterwards Murâd Bey),
                    carried to the citadel, and poisoned by Mohammad Bey. Thus terminated the career
                    of the famous Ali Bey, a man whose energy, talents, and ambition bear a strong
                    resemblance to those of the later Mehemet Ali.</p>
                <p>Mohammad Bey continued Sheykh el-Beled, tendered his allegiance to the Porte, and
                    was invested with the pashalik. He then entered Syria, and severely chastised
                    Sheykh Dhâhir, taking Gaza, Joppa, and Acre itself. Joppa was taken by assault,
                    and suffered a massacre of its inhabitants, and Acre was pillaged. At the latter
                    place the pasha suddenly died. His mosque in Cairo is the latest fine specimen
                    of Arab architecture, and is not unworthy of its better days.</p>
                <p>The chief competitors for power were now Ismail, Ibrahim, and Murâd, the first of
                    whom was speedily expelled, the contest continuing between the two latter beys.
                    Ibrahim at length succeeded in causing himself to be proclaimed Sheykh el-Beled,
                    and Murâd contented himself with the office of Emeer el-Hâgg, or chief of the
                    pilgrims; but this arrangement was not destined to be of long continuance; <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> violent quarrel resulted in a recourse to arms, and that
                    again in a peace of three years’ duration, during which the two beys held an
                    equal sway. In the year 1200 the Porte despatched Hassan Capitan (properly
                    Kapoodân) Pasha (or High Admiral), with a Turkish force, to reduce the turbulent
                    Memlooks to obedience, and to claim the annual tribute. Murâd Bey was defeated
                    at Er-Rahmâneeyeh, and the Turks advanced to Cairo, desolating the country, and
                    acting according to their almost invariable practice on such occasions. The
                    metropolis opened its gates to Hasan Pasha, who determined on pursuing the beys
                    to Upper Egypt, whither he despatched a large portion of his army, and a
                    sanguinary conflict took place. But a war with Russia recalled this commander to
                    Constantinople. Ismail was again created Sheykh el-Beled, and he held that post
                    until the terrible plague of the year 1205, in which he perished, and hence it
                    is commonly called the “Plague of Ismail.” His death caused the return of
                    Ibrahim and Murâd; and eight years after, intelligence of the arrival at
                    Alexandria <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a French army of 36,000 men, commanded by
                    General Bonaparte, united these chiefs in a common cause.</p>
                <p>On the 18th May 1798, this expedition, consisting of 13 sail of the line, 6
                    frigates, and 12 vessels of a smaller size, sailed from Toulon, and made the
                    coast of Egypt on the 1st July. The troops were landed near Alexandria, and the
                    city fell by assault on the 5th of that month. The French conquest and
                    occupation of Egypt belong to European history; a recapitulation of the
                    principal events of the period will therefore suffice in this place. The
                    Memlooks affected to despise their antagonist, and hastened to chastise him: at
                    Shibirrees they attacked the French and were repulsed; but, nothing discouraged,
                    they collected all their forces, exceeding 60,000 men, under the command of
                    Murâd, and entrenched themselves at Embâbeh, opposite Cairo. Here was fought the
                    battle which has been dignified with the name of that of the Pyramids. European
                    tactics completely bewildered the Memlooks: their famous cavalry was received on
                    the bayonets of the French squares; a galling fire of grape and musketry mowed
                    down their ranks; and of this great army only about 2500 horse escaped with
                    Murâd Bey, while 15,000 men of all arms fell on the field of battle. Having made
                    himself master of Cairo, Bonaparte despatched General Desaix to effect the
                    conquest of Upper Egypt, and the success of the Eastern expedition seemed
                    secured. But, ten days after the victory of Embâbeh, the battle of the Nile
                    annihilated the French fleet in Aboo-Keer (Aboukir) Bay, and most materially
                    influenced the future conduct of the war. On this point, Napoleon himself says,
                    “La perte de la bataille d’Aboukir eut une grande influence sur les affaires
                    d’Egypte et même sur celles du monde; la flotte Française sauvée, l’expédition
                    de Syrie n’éprouvait point d’obstacles, l’artillerie de siège se transportait
                    sûrement et facilement au-delà du désert, et Saint-Jean-d’Acre n’arrêtait point
                    l’armée Française. La flotte Française détruite, le divan s’enhardit à déclarer
                    la guerre à la France. L’armée perdit un grand appui, sa position en Égypte
                    changea totalement, et Napoléon dut renoncer à l’espoir d’asseoir à jamais la
                    puissance Française dans l’Occident par les résultats de l’expédition
                    d’Egypte.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Napoleon,

                    the purpose of frustrating the efforts of Sir Sydney Smith before Alexandria,
                    and of Jezzâr I’asha, who was advancing from Acre, still further obscured
                    Napoleon’s prospects in the East, and the victory soon after obtained by him
                    over the Ottoman army at Aboo Keer, the second defeat of Murâd Bey, and various
                    successes over the Turks, enabled the French general Kléber (Napoleon having
                    left for Europe after the first of these events) to set on foot negotiations for
                    an honourable evacuation of the country. But when the convention was already
                    signed, and the French were about to quit Cairo, Lord Keith signified to Kléber
                    that Great Britain would not consent to the terms of the treaty; and although
                    this refusal was afterwards rescinded, Kléber considered that the withdrawal
                    came too late: he totally defeated 70,000 men under the grand vizir at
                    Heliopolis, and returned to Cairo to quell an insurrection of the inhabitants.
                    This distinguished officer was about this time assassinated in the garden of his
                    palace by a fanatic, who was impaled in the great square (then a lake) called
                    the Ezbekeeyeh, in Cairo, and miserably lingered for the space of three days
                    before death put an end to his sufferings. Under Kléber’s administration, Egypt
                    began to resume its former prosperity; by his conciliatory and good government
                    much prejudice against the French was overcome; by ceding a part of Upper Egypt
                    to Murâd, he gained the good will of that chief, who gave him no cause to regret

                <p>On the death of Kléber, General Menou succeeded to the command, and although he
                    afterwards conducted the defence of the country with much valour, yet to his
                    injudicious administration, and his want of military talent, we must mainly
                    ascribe the determination of the British Government to attempt the expulsion of
                    the French from Egypt, and the rapid success of the campaign that ensued. On the
                    2d of March 1801 an army under Sir Ralph Abercromby arrived in Aboo-Keer Bay,
                    and made good a landing in the face of a well-disposed French force, which
                    offered every possible resistance. The memorable battle of Alexandria, in which
                    Abercromby fell, decided the fate of the war. A bold march, executed with
                    talent, effected the capitulation of Cairo; Alexandria surrendered on the 1st of
                    September, and the French sailed from the shores of Egypt in the course of that
                    month.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Very many of the

                <p>The history now requires that we should mention the early career of a man who
                    subsequently ruled the destinies of Egypt for a period of nearly forty years.
                    Mehemet Ali Pasha was born in <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> 1182 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1768-9) at Cavalia, a small sea-port town of
                    Albania. On the death of his father, in early life, he was brought up in the
                    house of the governor of the town, who, as a reward for military prowess, gave
                    him his daughter in marriage. By her he had, it is said, his three eldest sons,
                    Ibrahim,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibrahim is,
                    however, believed by many, or most, to have been the wife’s son by a former

                    bûluk-bâshee (or head of a body of infantry), he became a dealer in tobacco,
                    until, in his thirty-third year, he was despatched to Egypt with his patron’s
                    son, Ali Âghâ, and 300 men, the contingent furnished by his native place to the
                    Turkish expedition against the French; and soon after his arrival in that
                    country he succeeded, on the return of Ali Aghâ, to the command, with the
                    nominal rank of beenbâshee (or chief of a thousand men).</p>
                <p>Soon after the evacuation of Egypt by the French, that unfortunate country became
                    the scene of more severe troubles, in consequence of the unwarrantable attempts
                    of the Turks to destroy the power of the Ghuzz. In defiance of promises to the
                    English Government, orders were transmitted from Constantinople to Hoseyn Pasha,
                    the Turkish high admiral, to ensnare and put to death the principal beys.
                    Invited to an entertainment, they were, according to the Egyptian contemporary
                    historian El-Gabartee, attacked on board the flag-ship; Sir Robert Wilson and M.
                    Meħgin, however, state that they were fired on, in open boats, in the bay of
                    Aboo-Keer. They offered an heroic resistance, but were overpowered, and some
                    made prisoners, some killed, while some, including the afterwards celebrated
                    ’Osmân Bey El-Bardeesee, escaped in a boat, and sought refuge with the English,
                    who at that time occupied Alexandria. General Hutchinson, informed of this
                    treachery, immediately assumed threatening measures against the Turks, and in
                    consequence, the killed, wounded, and prisoners were given up to him. Such was
                    the commencement of the disastrous struggle between the Memlooks and the
                    Turks.</p>
                <p>Mohammad Khusruf was the first pasha after the expulsion of the French. The form
                    of government, however, was not the same as that before the French invasion, for
                    the Ghuzz were not reinstated. The pasha, and through him the sultan,
                    endeavoured on several occasions either to ensnare them or to beguile them into
                    submission; but these efforts failing, Mohammad Khusruf took the field, and a
                    Turkish detachment 14,000 strong, despatched against them to Demenhoor, whither
                    they had descended from Upper Egypt, was defeated by a small force under
                    El-Elfee; or, as Mengin says, by 800 men left by El-Elfee under the command of
                    El-Bardeesee. Their ammunition and guns fell into the hands of the Memlooks.</p>
                <p>In March 1803 the British evacuated Alexandria, and Mohammad Bey El-Elfee
                    accompanied them to England to consult respecting the means to be adopted for
                    restoring the former power of the Ghuzz. About six weeks after, the Arnaoot (or
                    Albanian) soldiers in the service of Khusruf tumultuously demanded their pay,
                    and surrounded the house of the defterdâr, who in vain appealed to the pasha to
                    satisfy their claims. The latter opened fire from the artillery of his palace on
                    the insurgent soldiery in the house of the defterdâr, across the Ezbekeeyeh. The
                    citizens of Cairo, accustomed to such occurrences, immediately closed their
                    shops, and the doors of the several quarters, and every man who possessed any
                    weapon armed himself. The tumult continued all the day, and the next morning a
                    body of troops sent out by the pasha failed to quell it. Tâhir, the commander of
                    the Albanians, then repaired to the citadel, gained admittance through an
                    embrasure, and, having obtained possession of it, began to cannon the pasha over
                    the roofs of the intervening houses, ariu. then descended with guns to the
                    Ezbekeeyeh, and laid close siege to the palace. On the following day, Mohammad
                    Khusruf made good his escape, with his women and servants and his regular
                    troops, and fled to Damietta by the river. This revolt marks the commencement of
                    the rise of Mehemet Ali to power in Egypt, and of the breach between the
                    Arnaoots and Turks which ultimately led to the expulsion of the latter.</p>
                <p>T⅛hir Pasha assumed the government, but in twenty-three days he met with his
                    death from exactly the same cause as that of the overthrow of his predecessor.
                    He refused the pay of certain of the Turkish troops, and was immediately
                    assassinated. A desperate conflict ensued between the Albanians and Turks; and
                    the palace was set on fire and plundered. The masters of Egypt were now split
                    into these two factions, animated with the fiercest animosity against each
                    other. Mehemet Ali became the head of the former, but his party was the weaker,
                    and he therefore entered into an alliance with Ibrahim Bey, and ’Osmân Bey
                    El-Bardeesee. A certain Ahmad Pasha, who was about to proceed to a province in
                    Arabia, of which he had been appointed governor, was raised to the important
                    post of pasha of Egypt, through the influence of the Turks and the favour of the
                    sheykhs; but Mehemet Ali, who with his Albanians held the citadel, refused to
                    assent to their choice; the Memlooks moved over from El-Geezeh, and Ahmad Pasha
                    betook himself to the mosque of Ez-Zâhir, which the French had converted into a
                    fortress. He was compelled to surrender by the Albanians; the two chiefs of the
                    Turks who killed Tâhir Pasha were taken with him and put to death, and he
                    himself was detained a prisoner. In consequence of the alliance between Mehemet
                    Ali and El-Bardeesee, the Albanians gave the citadel over to the Memlooks; and
                    soon after, these allies marched against Khusruf Pasha, who having been joined
                    by a considerable<pb break="no"

                    Damietta, was enabled to offer an obstinate resistance. After much loss on both
                    sides, he was taken prisoner and brought to Cairo; but he was treated with
                    respect. The victorious soldiery sacked the town of Damietta, and were guilty of
                    the barbarities usual with them on such occasions.</p>
                <p>A few days later, Ali Pasha El-Tarâbulusee landed at Alexandria with an imperial
                    fîrmân constituting him pasha of Egypt, and threatened the Beys, who now were
                    virtual masters of Upper Egypt, as well as of the capital and nearly the whole
                    of Lower Egypt. Mehemet Ali and El-Bardeesee therefore descended to Rosetta,
                    which had fallen into the hands of a brother of Ali Pasha, and having recovered
                    the town and captured its commander, El-Bardeesee purposed to proceed against
                    Alexandria; but the troops required arrears of pay which it was not in his power
                    to give, and the pasha had cut the dyke between the Lakes of Aboo-Keer and
                    Mareotis, thus rendering the approach to Alexandria more difficult. El-Bardeesee
                    and Mehemet Ali therefore returned to Cairo. The troubles of Egypt were now
                    increased by an insufficient inundation, and great scarcity prevailed,
                    aggravated by the exorbitant taxation to which the beys were compelled to resort
                    in order to raise money to pay the troops; while murder and rapine prevailed to
                    a frightful extent in the capital, the riotous soldiery being under little or no
                    control. In the meantime, Ali Pasha, who had been behaving in an outrageous
                    manner towards the Franks in Alexandria, received a khatt-i-shereef from the
                    sultan, which he sent by his secretary to Cairo. It announced that the beys
                    should live peaceably in Egypt, with an annual pension each of fifteen purses
                    and other privileges, but that the government should be in the hands of the
                    pasha. To this the beys assented, but with considerable misgivings; for they had
                    intercepted letters from Ali to the Albanians, endeavouring to alienate them
                    from their side to his own. Deceptive answers were returned to these, and Ali
                    was induced by them to advance towards Cairo at the head of 2500 men. The forces
                    of the beys, with the Albanians, encamped near him at Shalakân, and he fell back
                    on a place called Zufeyteh. They next seized his boats conveying soldiers,
                    servants, and his ammunition and baggage; and, following him, they demanded
                    wherefore he brought with him so numerous a body of men, in opposition to usage
                    and to their previous warning. Finding they would not allow his troops to
                    advance, forbidden himself to retreat with them to Alexandria, and being
                    surrounded by the enemy, he would have hazarded a battle, but his men refused to
                    fight. He therefore repaired to the camp of the beys, and his army was compelled
                    to retire to Syria. In the hands of the beys, Ali Pasha again attempted
                    treachery. A horseman was seen to leave his tent one night at full gallop; he
                    was the bearer of a letter to OsmΛn Bey Hasan, the governor of Kinè. This
                    offered a fair pretext to the Memlooks to rid themselves of a man whose
                    antecedents and present conduct proved him to be a perfidious tyrant. He was
                    sent under a guard of forty-five men towards the Syrian frontier; and about a
                    week after, news was received that in a skirmish with some of his own soldiers
                    he had fallen mortally wounded.</p>
                <p>The death of Ali Pasha produced only temporary tranquillity; in a few days the
                    return of Mohammad Bey El-Elfee (called the Great or Elder) from England was the
                    signal for fresh disturbances, which, by splitting the Ghuzz into two parties,
                    accelerated their final overthrow. An ancient jealousy existed between El-Elfee
                    and the other most powerful bey, El-Bardeesee. The latter was now supreme among
                    the Ghuzz, and this fact considerably heightened their old enmity. While the
                    guns of the citadel. those at Masr El-’Ateekah, and even those of the palace of
                    El-Bardeesee, were thrice fired in honour of El-Elfee, preparations were
                    immediately commenced to oppose him. His partisans were collected opposite
                    Cairo, and El-Elfee the Younger held El-Geezeh; but treachery was among them;
                    Hoseyn Bey El-Elfee was assassinated by emissaries of El-Bardeesee, and Mehemet
                    Ali, with his Albanians, gained possession of El-Geezeh, which was, as usual,
                    given over to the troops to pillage. In the meanwhile El-Elfee the Great
                    embarked at Rosetta, and not apprehending opposition, was on his way to Cairo,
                    when a little south of the town of Manoof he encountered a party of Albanians,
                    and with difficulty made his escape. He gained the eastern branch of the Nile,
                    but the river had become dangerous, and he fled to the desert. There he had
                    several hairbreadth escapes, and at last secreted himself among a tribe of Arabs
                    at Ras-el-Wâdee. A change in the fortune of El-Bardeesee, however, favoured his
                    plans for the future. That chief, in order to satisfy the demands of the
                    Albanians for their pay, gave orders to levy heavy contributions from the
                    citizens of Cairo; and this new oppression roused them to rebellion. The
                    Albanians, alarmed for their safety, assured the populace that they would not
                    allow the order to be executed; and Mehemet Ali himself caused a proclamation to
                    be made to that effect. Thus the Albanians became the favourites of the people,
                    and took advantage of their opportunity. Three days later they beset the house
                    of the aged Ibrahim Bey, and that of El-Bardeesee, both of whom effected their
                    escape with difficulty. The Memlooks in the citadel directed a fire of shot and
                    shell on the houses of the Albanians which were situated in the Ezbekeeyeh; but
                    on hearing of the flight of their chiefs, they evacuated the place; and Mehemet
                    Ali, on gaining possession of it, once more proclaimed Mahomet Khusruf pasha of
                    Egypt. For one day and a half he enjoyed the title; the friends of the late
                    Tahir Pasha then accomplished his second degradation,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Khusruf Pasha afterwards filled with credit
                    several of the highest offices at Constantinople. He died on the 1st of February
                    1855. He was a bigot of the old school, strongly opposed to the influences of
                    Western civilization, and consequently to the assistance of France and England
                    in the Crimean wsr.</p></note> and Cairo was again the scene of terrible
                    enormities, the Albanians revelling in the houses of the Memlook chiefs, whose
                    hareems met with no mercy at their hands. These events were the signal for the
                    reappearance of El-Elfee.</p>
                <p>The Albanians now invited Ahmad Pasha Khursheed to assume the reins of
                    government, and he without delay proceeded from Alexandria to Cairo. The forces
                    of the partisans of El-Bardeesee were ravaging the country a few miles south of
                    the capital and intercepting the supplies of corn by the river; a little later
                    they passed to the north of Cairo and successively took Bilbeys and Kalyoob,
                    plundering the villages, destroying the crops, and slaughtering the herds of the
                    inhabitants. Cairo was itself in a state of tumult, suffering severely from a
                    scarcity of grain, and the heavy exactions of the pasha to meet the demands of
                    his turbulent troops, at that time augmented by a Turkish detachment. The shops
                    were closed, and the unfortunate people assembled in great crowds, crying Yâ
                    Lateef! Υά Lateef! “0 Gracious [God] !” El-Elfee and’OsmAn Bey Hasan had
                    professed allegiance to the pasha; but they soon after declared against him, and
                    they were now approaching from the south; and having repulsed Mehemet Ali, they
                    took the two fortresses of Turà. These Mehemet Ali speedily retook by night with
                    4000 infantry and cavalry; but the enterprise was only partially successful. On
                    the following day the other Memlooks north of the metropolis actually penetrated
                    into the suburbs; but a few days later were defeated in a battle fought at
                    Shubrà, with heavy loss <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n785/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0785-0762"/> on both sides. This reverse in a measure united
                    the two great Memlook parties, though their chiefs remained at enmity.
                    El-Bardeesee passed to the south of Cairo, and the (jrhuzz gradually retreated
                    towards Lipper Egypt. Thither the pasha despatched three successive expeditious
                    (one of which was commanded by Mehemet Ali), and many battles were fought, but
                    without decisive result.</p>
                <p>At this period another calamity befell Egypt; about 3000 Delees arrived in Cairo
                    from Syria. These troops had been sent for by Khursheed in order to strengthen
                    himself against the Albanians; and the events of this portion of the history
                    afford sad proof of their ferocity and brutal enormities, in which they far
                    exceeded the ordinary Turkish soldiers and even the Albanians. Their arrival
                    immediately recalled Mehemet Ali and his party from the war, and instead of
                    aiding Khursheed was the proximate cause of his overthrow.</p>
                <p>Cairo was ripe for revolt; the pasha was hated for his tyranny and extortion, and
                    execrated for the deeds of his troops, especially those of the Delees: the
                    sheykhs enjoined the people to close their shops, and the soldiers clamoured for
                    pay. At this juncture a firmàn arrived from Constantinople conferring on Mehemet
                    Ali the pashalic of Jiddeh; but the occurrences of a few days raised him to that
                    of Egypt.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of Safar 1220 (May 1805) the sheykhs, with an immense concourse of
                    the inhabitants, assembled in the house of the kadee; and the ’Ulemà, amid the
                    prayers and cries of the people, wrote a full statement of the heavy wrongs
                    which they had endured under the administration of the pasha. The ’Ulemà, in
                    answer, were desired to go to the citadel; but they were apprised of treachery;
                    and on the following day, having held another council at the house of the kadee,
                    they proceeded to Mehemet Ali, and informed him that the people would no longer
                    submit to Khursheed. “Then whom will ye have <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> said he.
                    “We will have <hi rend="italic">theef</hi> they replied, “to govern us according
                    to the laws; for we see in thy countenance that thou art possessed of justice
                    and goodness.” Mehemet Ali seemed to hesitate, and then complied, and was at
                    once invested. On this, a bloody struggle commenced between the two pashas.
                    Cairo had before experienced such conflicts in the streets and over the
                    housetops, but none so severe as this. Khursheed, being informed by a messenger
                    of the insurrection, immediately laid in stores of provisions and ammunition,
                    and prepared to stand a siege in the citadel. Two chiefs of the Albanians joined
                    his party, but many of his soldiers deserted. Mehemet Ali’s great strength lay
                    in the devotion of the citizens of Cairo, who looked on him as their future
                    deliverer from their afflictions; and great numbers armed themselves, advising
                    constantly with Mehemet Ali, having the seyyid ’Omar and the sheykhs at their
                    head, and guarding the town at night. On the 19th of the same month, Mehemet Ali
                    besieged Khursheed. Retrenchments were raised, and the lofty minaret of the
                    mosque of the sultan Hasan was used as a battery whence to fire on the citadel;
                    while gnus were also posted on the mountain in its rear. After the siege had
                    continued many days, Khursheed gave orders to cannonade and bombard the town;
                    and for six days his commands were executed with little interruption, the
                    citadel itself also lying between two fires. Mehemet Ali’s position at this time
                    was very critical: his troops became mutinous for their pay; the silàhdàr, who
                    had commanded one of the expeditions against the Ghuzz, advanced to the relief
                    of Khursheed; and the latter ordered the Delees to march to his assistance. The
                    firing ceased on the Friday <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, but recommenced on
                    the eve of Saturday and lasted until the next Friday. On the day following, news
                    came of the arrival at Alexandria of a messenger from Constantinople. The
                    ensuing night in Cairo presented a curious spectacle; many of the inhabitants
                    gave way to rejoicing, in the hope that this envoy would put an end to their
                    miseries, and fired off their weapons as they paraded the streets with bands of
                    music. The silàhdàr, imagining the noise to be a fray, marched in haste towards
                    the citadel, while its garrison sallied forth, and commenced throwing up
                    retrenchments in the quarter of ’Arab-el-Yesàr, but were repulsed by the armed
                    inhabitants and the soldiers stationed there; and during all this time, the
                    cannonade and bombardment from the citadel, and on it from the batteries on the
                    mountain, continued unabated.</p>
                <p>The envoy brought a firmàn confirming Mehemet Ali, and ordering Khursheed to
                    repair to Alexandria, there to await further orders; but this he refused to do,
                    on the ground that he had been appointed by a khatt-i-shereef. The firing ceased
                    on the following day <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, but the troubles of the
                    people were rather increased than assuaged; murders and robberies were daily
                    committed by the soldiery, the shops were all shut and some of the streets
                    barricaded. While these scenes were being enacted, El-Elfee was besieging
                    Demenhoor, and the other beys were returning towards Cairo, Khursheed having
                    called them to his assistance.</p>
                <p>Soon after this, a squadron under the command of the Turkish high admiral arrived
                    in Aboo-Keer Bay, with despatches confirmatory of the firman brought by the
                    former envoy, and authorizing Mehemet Ali to continue to discharge the functions
                    of governor for the present. Khursheed at first refused to yield; but at length,
                    on condition that his troops should be paid, he evacuated the citadel and
                    embarked for Rosetta.</p>
                <p>Mehemet Ali now possessed the title of Governor of Egypt, but beyond the walls of
                    Cairo his authority was everywhere disputed by the beys, who were joined by the
                    army of the silàhdàr of Khursheed; and many Albanians deserted from his ranks.
                    To replenish his empty coffers he was also compel’ed to levy exactions,
                    principally from the Copts. An attempt was made to ensnare certain of the beys,
                    who were encamped north of the metropolis. On the 17th of August 1805, the dam
                    of the canal of Cairo was to be cut, and some chiefs of Mehemet Ali’s party
                    wrote, informing them that he would go forth early on that morning with most of
                    his troops to witness the ceremony, inviting them to enter and seize the city
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, and, to deceive them, stipulating for a certain
                    sum of money as a reward. The dam, however, was cut early in the preceding
                    night, without any ceremony. On the following morning, these beys, with their
                    memlooks, a very numerous body, broke open the gate of the suburb
                    El-Hoseyneeyeh, and gained admittance into the city from the north, through the
                    gate called Bàb el-Futooh. They marched along the principal street for some
                    distance, with kettle-drums behind each company, and were received with apparent
                    joy by the citizens. At the mosque called the Ashrafeeyeh they separated, one
                    party proceeding to the Azhar and the houses of certain sheykhs, and the other
                    continuing along the main street, and through the gate called Bàb Zuweyleh,
                    where they turned up towards the citadel. Here they were fired on by some
                    soldiers from the houses; and with this signal a terrible massacre commenced.
                    Falling back towards their companions, they found the bye-streets closed; and in
                    that part of the main thoroughfare called Beyn-el-Kasreyn, they were suddenly
                    placed between two fires. Tims shut up in a narrow street, some sought refuge in
                    the collegiate mosque El-Barkookeeyeh, while the remainder fought their way
                    through their enemies, and escaped over the city-wall with the loss of their
                    horses. Two memlooks had in the meantime succeeded, by great exertions, in
                    giving the alarm to their comrades in the quarter of the Azhar, who escaped by
                    the eastern gate called Bàb el-Ghureiyib<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n786/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0786-0763"/>. A horrible fate awaited those who had shut
                    themselves up in the Barkookeeyeh. Having begged for quarter and surrendered,
                    they were immediately stripped nearly naked, and about fifty were slaughtered on
                    the spot; and about the same number were dragged away, with every brutal
                    aggravation of their pitiful condition, to Mehemet Ali. Among them were four
                    beys, one of whom, driven to madness by Mehemet All’s mockery, asked for a drink
                    of water; his hands λvere untied that he might take the bottle, but he snatched
                    a dagger from one of the soldiers and rushed at the pasha, and fell covered with
                    wounds. The wretched captives were then chained and left in the court of the
                    pasha’s house; and on the following morning the heads of their comrades who had
                    perished the day before were skinned and stuffed with straw before their eyes.
                    One bey and two others paid their ransom and were released; the rest, without
                    exception, were tortured and put to death in the course of the ensuing night.
                    Eighty-three heads (many of them those of Frenchmen and Albanians) were stuffed
                    and sent to Constantinople, with a boast that the Memlook chiefs were utterly
                    destroyed. Thus ended Mehemet All’s first massacre of his too confiding
                    enemies.</p>
                <p>The beys, after this, appear to have despaired of regaining their ascendency;
                    most of them retreated to Upper Egypt, and an attempt at compromise failed.
                    El-Elfee offered his submission on the condition of the cession of the Feiyoom
                    and other provinces; but this was refused, and that chief gained two successive
                    victories over the pasha’s troops, many of whom deserted to him.</p>
                <p>At length, in consequence of the remonstrances of the English, and a promise made
                    by El-Elfee of 1500 purses, the Porte consented to reinstate the twenty-four
                    beys, and to place El-Elfee at their head; but this measure met with the
                    opposition of Mehemet Ali and the determined resistance of the majority of the
                    Memlooks, who, rather than have El-Elfee at their head, preferred their present
                    condition; for the enmity of El-Bardeesee had not subsided, and he commanded the
                    voice of most of the other beys. In pursuance of the above plan, a squadron
                    under Sâlih Pasha, shortly before appointed high admiral, arrived at Alexandria
                    on the 1st of July 1806, with 3000 regular troops, and a successor to Mehemet
                    Ali, who was to receive the pashalik of Salonica. This wily chief professed his
                    willingness to obey the commands of the Porte, but stated that his troops, to
                    whom he owed a vast sum of money, opposed his departure. He induced the ’Ulema
                    to sign a letter, praying the sultan to revoke the command for reinstating the
                    beys, persuaded the chiefs of the Albanian troops to swear allegiance to him,
                    and sent 2000 purses contributed by them to Constantinople. El-Elfee was at that
                    time besieging Demenhoor, and he gained a signal victory over the pasha’s
                    troops; but the dissensions of the beys destroyed their last chance of a return
                    to pow er. El-Elfee and his partisans were unable to pay the sum promised to the
                    Porte; Sâlili Pasha received plenipotentiary powers from Constantinople, in
                    consequence of the letter from the ’Ulema; and, on the condition of Mehemet
                    Ali’s paying 4000 purses to the Porte, it was decided that he should continue in
                    his post, and the reinstatement of the beys was abandoned. Fortune continued to
                    favour the pasha. In the following month, El-Bardeesee died, aged forty-eight
                    years; and soon after, a scarcity of provisions excited the troops of El-Elfee
                    to revolt. That bey very reluctantly raised the siege of Demenhoor, being in
                    daily expectation of the arrival of an English army; and at the village of
                    Shubra-ment he was attacked by a sudden illness, and died on the 30th of January
                    1807, at the age of fifty-five. Thus was the pasha relieved of his two most
                    formidable enemies; and shortly after he defeated Shâheen Bey, with the loss to
                    the latter of his artillery and baggage and 300 men killed or taken
                    prisoners.</p>
                <p>On the 17th of March 1807, a British fleet appeared off Alexandria, having on
                    board nearly 5000 troops, under the command of General Fraser; and the place,
                    being disaffect ed towards Mehemet Ali, opened its gates to them. Here they
                    first heard of the death of El-Elfee, upon whose co-operation they had founded
                    their chief hopes of success; and they immediately despatched messengers to his
                    successor and to the other beys inviting them to Alexandria. The British
                    resident, Major Misset, having represented the importance of taking Rosetta and
                    Er-Rahmaneeyeh, to secure supplies for Alexandria, General Fraser, with the
                    concurrence of the admiral, Sir John Duck-worth, detached the 31st regiment and
                    the Chasseurs Britanniques, under Major-General Wauchope and Brigadier-General
                    Meade, on this service; and these troops entered Rosetta without encountering
                    any opposition; but as soon as they had dispersed among the narrow streets, the
                    garrison opened a deadly fire on them from the latticed windows and the roofs of
                    the houses. They effected a retreat on Aboo-Keer and Alexandria, after a very
                    heavy loss of 185 killed and 262 wounded, General Wauchope and three officers
                    being among the former, and General Meade and seventeen officers among the
                    latter. The heads of the slain were fixed on stakes on each side of the road
                    crossing the Ezbekeeyeh in Cairo.</p>
                <p>Mehemet Ali, meanwhile, was conducting an expedition against the beys in U pper
                    Egypt, and he had defeated them near Asyoot, when he heard of the arrival of the
                    British. In great alarm lest the beys should join them, especially as they were
                    far north of his position, he immediately sent messengers to his rivals,
                    promising to comply with all their demands, if they should join in expelling the
                    invaders; and this proposal being agreed to, both armies marched towards Cairo
                    on opposite sides of the river.</p>
                <p>To return to the unfortunate British expedition. The possession of Rosetta being
                    deemed indispensable, Brigadier-General Stewart and Colonel Oswald were
                    despatched thither, with 2500 men. For thirteen days a cannonade of the town was
                    continued without effect; and on the 20th of April, news having come in from the
                    advanced guard at El-Hamâd of large reinforcements to the besieged, General
                    Stewart was compelled to retreat; and a dragoon was despatched to Major Macleod,
                    commanding at El Hamâd, with orders to fall back. The messenger, however, was
                    unable to penetrate to the spot; and the advanced guard, consisting of a
                    detachment of the 71st, two companies of the 78th, one of the 35th, and De
                    Rolles’s regiment, with a picquet of dragoons, the -whole mustering 733 men, was
                    surrounded, and, after a gallant resistance, the survivors, who had expended all
                    their ammunition, became prisoners of war. General Stewart regained Alexandria
                    with the remainder of his force, having lost, in killed, wounded, and missing,
                    nearly 900 men. Some hundreds of British heads were now exposed on stakes in
                    Cairo, and the prisoners were marched between these mutilated remains of their
                    countrymen.</p>
                <p>The beys became divided in their wishes, one party being desirous of co-operating
                    with the British, the other with the pasha. These delays proved ruinous to their
                    cause; and General Fraser, despairing of their assistance, evacuated Alexandria
                    on the 14th of September. From that date to the spring of 1811, the beys from
                    timeto time relinquished certain of their demands; the pasha on his part granted
                    them what before had been withheld; the province of the Feiyoom, and part of
                    those of El-Geezeh and Benee-Suweyf, were ceded to Shâheen; and a great portion
                    of the Sa’eed, on the condition of paying the land-tax, to the others. Many of
                    them took up their abode in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0787-0764"/> Cairo, but tranquillity was not secured; several
                    times they met the pasha’s forces in battle, and once gained a signal victory.
                    Early in the year 1811, the preparations for an expedition against the Wahhâbees
                    in Arabia being complete, all the Memlook beys then in Cairo were invited to the
                    ceremony of investing Mehemet Ali’s favourite son, Toosoon, with a pelisse and
                    the command of the army. As on the former occasion, the unfortunate Memlooks
                    fell into the snare. On the 1st of March, Shâbeen Bey and the other chiefs (one
                    only excepted) repaired with their retinues to the citadel, and were courteously
                    received by the pasha. Having taken coffee, they formed in procession, and,
                    preceded and followed by the pasha’s troops, slowly descended the steep and
                    narrow road leading to the great gate of the citadel; but as soon as the
                    Memlooks arrived at the gate it was suddenly closed before them. The last of
                    those who made their exit before the gate was shut were Albanians under Sâlih
                    Koosh. To these troops their chief now made known the pasha’s orders to massacre
                    all the Memlooks within the citadel; therefore, having returned by another way,
                    they gained the summits of the walls and houses that hem in the road in which
                    the Memlooks were incarcerated, and some stationed themselves upon the eminences
                    of the rock through which that road is partly cut. Thus securely placed, they
                    commenced a heavy fire on their defenceless victims; and immediately the troops
                    who closed the procession, and who had the advantage of higher ground, followed
                    their example. Of the betrayed chiefs, many were laid low in a few moments;
                    some, dismounting, and throwing off their outer robes, vainly sought, sword in
                    hand, to return, and escape by some other gate. The few who regained the summit
                    of the citadel experienced the same cruel fate as the rest (for those whom the
                    Albanian soldiers made prisoners met with no mercy from their chiefs or from
                    Mehemet Ali), but it soon became impossible for any to retrace their steps even
                    so far; the road was obstructed by the bleeding bodies of the slain Memlooks,
                    and their richly caparisoned horses, and their grooms. 470 Memlooks entered the
                    citadel; and of these very few, if any, escaped. One of these is said to have
                    been a bey. According to some, he leapt his horse from the ramparts, aud
                    alighted uninjured, though the horse was killed by the fall; others say that he
                    was prevented from joining his comrades, and discovered the treachery while
                    waiting without the gate. He fled and made his way to Syria. This massacre was
                    the signal for an indiscriminate slaughter of the Memlooks throughout Egypt,
                    orders to this effect being transmitted to every governor; and in Cairo itself,
                    the houses of the beys were given over to the soldiery, who slaughtered all
                    their adherents, treated their women in the most shameless manner, and sacked
                    their dwellings. During the two following days, the pasha and his son Toosoon
                    rode about the streets, and endeavoured to stop these atrocious proceedings; but
                    order was not restored until 500 houses had been completely pillaged. In
                    extenuation of this dark blot on Mehemet Ali’s character, it has been urged that
                    he had received the order for the destruction of the Memlooks from
                    Constantinople, whither the heads of the beys were sent. It may be answered to
                    this plea, that on other occasions he scrupled not to defy the Porte.</p>
                <p>A remnant of the Memk&gt;oks fled to Nubia, and a tranquillity was restored to
                    Egypt to which it had long been unaccustomed, and which has rarely been
                    interrupted siιιce. In the year following the massacre, the unfortunate exiles
                    were attacked by Ibrahim Pasha, the eldest son of Mehemet Ali, in the fortified
                    town of Ibreem, in Nubia. Here the want of provisions forced them to evacuate
                    the place; a few who surrendered were beheaded, and the rest went further south
                    aud built the town of New Dongola (correctly Dunkulah), where the venerable
                    Ibraham Bey died in 1816, at the age of eighty. As their numbers thinned, they
                    endeavoured to maintain their little power by training some hundreds of blacks;
                    but again, on the approach of Ismail, another son of the pasha of Egypt, sent
                    with an army to subdue Nubia and Sennâr, some returned to Egypt and settled in
                    Cairo, while the rest, amounting to about 100 persons, fled in dispersed parties
                    to the countries adjacent to Sennâr.</p>
                <p>Mehemet Ali, being undisputed master of Egypt, at the reiterated commands of the
                    Porte despatched in 1811 an army of 8000 men, including 2000 horse, under the
                    command of Toosoon Pasha, against the Wahhâbees. After a successful advance,
                    this force met with a serious repulse at the pass of Safrà and Judeiyideh, and
                    retreated to Yembo’. In the following year Toosoon, having received
                    reinforcements, again assumed the offensive, and captured Medinah after a
                    prolonged siege. He next took Jiddeh and Mecca, defeating the Wahhâbees beyond
                    the latter place and capturing their general. But some mishaps followed, and
                    Mehemet Ali, who had determined to conduct the war in person, left Egypt for
                    that purpose in the summer in 1813. In Arabia he encountered serious obstacles
                    from the nature of the country and the harassing mode of warfare adopted by his
                    adversaries. His arms met with various fortune; but on the whole his forces
                    proved superior to those of the enemy. He led a successful expedition in the
                    Hijâz, and, after concluding a treaty with the Wahhâbee chief, ’Abd-Allah, in
                    1815, he returned to Egypt on hearing of the escape of Napoleon from Elba.</p>
                <p>He now confiscated the lands belonging to private individuals, merely allowing
                    them a pension for life, and attempted to introduce the European system of
                    military tactics. A formidable mutiny, however, broke out in the metropolis, the
                    pasha’s life was endangered, and he sought refuge by night in the citadel, while
                    the soldiery committed many acts of plunder. The revolt was reduced by presents
                    to the chiefs of the insurgents, and Mehemet Ali very honourably ordered that
                    the sufferers by the late disturbances should receive compensation from the
                    treasury. The project of the “Nizâm Gedeed,” as the European system is called in
                    Egypt, was, in consequence of this commotion, abandoned for a time,</p>
                <p>Soon after Toosoon returned to Egypt, but Mehemet Ali, dissatisfied with the
                    treaty which had been concluded with the Wahhâbees, and with the non-fulfilment
                    of certain of its clauses, determined to send another army to Arabia, and to
                    include in it the soldiers who had recently proved unruly. This expedition,
                    under Ibrahim Pasha, left in the autumn of 1816. After several unimportant
                    advantages, Ibrahim sat down before the town of Er-Rass; but three months’
                    exertions proving unavailing, he raised the siege, with the loss of nearly half
                    his army. Notwithstanding, he advanced on the capital, Ed-Dir’eeyeh, by slow but
                    sure steps. The last place before reaching that city offered a brave resistance,
                    and Ibrahim, in revenge, caused all its inhabitants to be put to the sword,
                    except a number of women and children, the former of whom were spared not from
                    motives of pity. Ed-Dir’eeyeh fell after a five months’ siege, in the course of
                    which an explosion destroyed the whole of the besiegers’ powder; aud had the
                    Wahhâbees been aware of the extent of the disaster, few, we may believe, would
                    have escaped to tell the tale. ’Abd-Allah, their chief, was taken, and with his
                    treasurer and secretary was sent to Constantinople, where, in spite of Ibrahim’s
                    promise of safety, and of Mehemet Ali’s intercession in their favour, they were
                    paraded and put to death. At the close of the year 1819, Ibrahim returned to
                    Cairo, having conquered all present opposition in Arabia, but without having
                    broken the spirit of the Wahhâbees.</p>

                <p>The pasha, since his return from Arabia, had turned his attention to the
                    improvement of the manufactures of Egypt, and engaged very largely in commerce.
                    The results of these attempts are stated in other places, but the important work
                    of digging the new canal of Alexandria, called the Mahmoodeeyeh, must here be
                    again mentioned. The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of
                    a safe channel between Alexandria and the Nile was much felt. Such was the
                    object of the canal then excavated, and it has on the whole well answered its
                    purpose; but the sacrifice of life was enormous, and the labour of the unhappy
                    fellâhs was forced. Towards the accomplishment of a favourite project, the
                    formation of the Nizam Gedeed, a force was ordered to the southern frontier of
                    Egypt, and the conquest of Sennâr was contemplated in order to get rid of the
                    disaffected troops, and to obtain a sufficient number of captives to form the
                    nucleus of the new army. The forces destined for this service were led by
                    Ismail, then the youngest son of Mehemet Ali; they consisted of between 4000 and
                    5000 men, Turks and Arabs, and were despatched in the summer of 1820. Nubia at
                    once submitted, the Shageeyeb Arabs immediately beyond the province of Dongola
                    were worsted, and Senuâr was reduced without a battle. Mohammad Bey, the
                    defterdär, with another force of about the same strength, was then sent by
                    Mehemet Ali against Kurdufân with a like result, but not without a hard fought
                    engagement. In 1822 Ismail was, with his retinue, put to death by an Arab
                    chieftain named Nimr; and the defterdär, a man infamous fur his cruelty, assumed
                    the command in those provinces, and exacted terrible retribution from the
                    innocent inhabitants.</p>
                <p>In the years 1821 and 1822 Mehemet Ali despatched both ships and men (the latter
                    about 7000 or 8000 Albanians and Turks) to the Morea, Cyprus, and Candia, to aid
                    the Porte in reducing the Greek insurrection; and he continued to take part in
                    that struggle, his fleet being engaged at Navarino, until the English insisted
                    on the evacuation of the Morea in 1828 by Ibrahim Pasha. In 1822 an army of
                    disciplined troops was at length organized: 8000 men (chiefly slaves, from
                    Sennâr and Kurdufân) were trained by French officers at Aswan. Of the vast
                    numbers seized in the countries above named, many died on the way; those who
                    were not eligible were, with the women, sold in Cairo, and in the remainder were
                    incorporated many fellahs. Colonel Sèves (Suleymân Pasha), a Frenchman who after
                    wards became a Moslem, superintended their organization; great numbers of the
                    blacks died, but the Egyptians proved very good troops. Many thousands were
                    pressed in consequence, and they now constitute the bulk of the army. In 1823
                    the new conscripts amounted to 24,000 men, composing six regiments of infantry,
                    each regiment consisting of five battalions of 800 men, and the battalions of
                    eight companies of 100 men.</p>
                <p>In 1824 a native rebellion of a religious character broke out in Upper Egypt,
                    headed by one Ahmad, an inhabitant of Es-Sâlimeeyeh, a village situate a few
                    miles above Thebes. He proclaimed himself a prophet, and was soon followed by
                    between 20,000 and 30,000 insurgents, mostly peasants, but some deserters from
                    the Nizam, for that force was yet in a half-organized state and in part declared
                    for the impostor. The insurrection was crushed by Mehemet Ali, and about
                    one-fourth of Ahmad’s followers perished, but he himself escaped and was never
                    after heard of. Few of these unfortunates possessed any other weapon than the
                    long staff (nebboot) of the Egyptian peasant; still they offered an obstinate
                    resistance, and the combat resembled a massacre. In the same year war was once
                    more made on the Wahhâbees, who had collected in considerable numbers. The 2d
                    regiment was sent on this service, and it behaved in a very creditable
                    manner.</p>
                <p>But the events of the war with the Porte are perhaps the most important of the
                    life of Mehemet Ali. The campaign of 1831 had ostensibly for its object the
                    castigation of ’Abd-Allah, pasha of Acre; the invading force consisted of six
                    regiments of infantry, four of cavalry, four field-pieces, and a greater number
                    of siege-guns, the whole under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, while the fleet,
                    conveying provisions, ammunition, Ac., was to accompany the army by sea. The
                    terrible cholera of 1831, however, stayed the expedition when it was on the eve
                    of departing; 5000 of its number died, and it was not until early in October of
                    the same year that it started. Little opposition was encountered on the way to
                    Acre, whither Ibrahim had gone by sea, and that place was invested on the 29th
                    of November. The artillery of the besieged was well served; an assault in the
                    following February was repulsed,, and the cold and rain of a Syrian winter
                    severely tried the Egyptian troops. A second assault in like manner failed, and
                    Ibrahim was called away to repel Osmân Pasha, governor of Aleppo. The latter,
                    however, hastily decamped without giving him battle, and Ibrahim, deeming this
                    advantage sufficient, retraced his steps towards Acre. He then pushed the siege
                    with fresh vigour, and stormed the city on the 27 th of May; 1400 men fell in
                    the breach, and the garrison was found to be reduced to about 400 men. The fall
                    of Acre was followed by negotiation. Mehemet Ali evinced a disposition for
                    peace, but demanded the government of Syria, and the Porte, in consequence,
                    denounced him as a traitor. On his part, Ibrahim pushed his successes; Damascus
                    was evacuated at his approach, and the battle of Hirns, fought on the 8th of
                    July 1832, decided the superiority of the Egyptian army, and the advantage of
                    disciplined troops over an irregular force, although very disproportionate in
                    numbers. The enemy composed the advanced guard of the Turkish army, 30,000
                    strong, and the Egyptians numbered only 16,000 men.</p>
                <p>Alter this victory, Ibrahim marched to Hamâh, and thence to Aleppo (which had
                    just before closed its gates against the Turkish general-in-chief, Hoseyn Pasha,
                    whose troops became rapidly disorganized), forced the defiles of Beykin, and
                    pursued the fugitive Turks to Adaneh. About the same time an Egyptian squadron
                    had chased the sultan’s fleet into Constantinople. Diplomacy was, at this point,
                    again resorted to, but without any result; the sultan depended on his fleet to
                    protect the capital, and determined to risk another engagement with the
                    victorious enemy. The charge of this venture was intrusted to Resheed Pasha, the
                    grand vizir. In the meantime, Ibrahim Pasha had gained the pass of Taurus, and
                    having beaten the Turks at Oulou-Kislâk, he hesitated not to give battle to
                    Resheed Pasha at the head of about 60,000 men, his own army being less than half
                    that strength; the battle of Kooniyeh,on the plains of Anatolia, proved utterly
                    disastrous to the Porte; in the confusion of the fight, and the darkness of a
                    thick day, the grand vizir was made prisoner, his army routed, and
                    Constantinople was within six marches of the victor, without an army to oppose
                    his passage. The capital of the Ottoman Empire, in imminent danger by sea and
                    land, was then intrusted to the keeping of its hereditary enemy, as the last
                    resource of the sultan Mahmood, and a Russian fleet and army were sent thither.
                    Negotiations were in cousequence opened, and on the 14th of May 1833 a treaty
                    was concluded between Mehemet Ali and the Porte, by which the whole of Syria and
                    the district of Adaneh were ceded to the former, on condition of his paying
                    tribute. With this terminated the war, but not the animosity of the sultan.
                    Ibrahim, by excessive firmness and rigour, speedily restored security and
                    tranquillity to the greater part of Syria; but some years later, the attempt of
                    Mahmood to get the better· of his vassal, and the consequent <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0789-0766"/> disaster experienced by his arms at Nezeeb,
                    entailed fresh complications, and the interference of Great Britain ended in the
                    restoration of Syria to the Porte in 1841. Mehemet Ali had placed all his
                    reliance on the co-operation of France, and to its desertion of his cause, and
                    his confidence in its assistance, either moral or material, must be ascribed the
                    unfortunate issue of the war. That the Syrians, in general, preferred the rule
                    of Mehemet Ali to the tyranny of pashas appointed from Constantinople may be
                    safely averred; but we cannot close this account of his possession of that
                    province without animadverting on the horrible cruelties perpetrated by Ibrahim
                    Pasha, or warning our readers not to give credence to the unmeasured praise
                    bestowed by many on the Egyptian troops there engaged. Conceding that they were
                    superior soldiers to the Turks, it must be borne in mind that they were
                    veterans, disciplined and led by the French officers and an able general; their
                    opponents were destitute of any European discipline, badly officered, and
                    discouraged by the disasters in Greece. It has, moreover, been stated on good
                    authority, that Ibrahim owed much of his success to the placing of artillery in
                    the rear of his troops, with orders to fire on them should they show symptoms of
                    wavering.</p>
                <p>After the peace of 1841 Mehemet Ali gave up all great political projects, and
                    solely occupied himself in improvements, real or imaginary, in Egypt. He
                    continued to prosecute his commercial speculations, and manufacturing,
                    educational, and other schemes. The barrage of the Nile, still uncompleted, was
                    commenced by his direction, and in 1847 he visited Constantinople, where he
                    received the rank of vizir. In the year 1848, however, symptoms of imbecility
                    appeared; and after a short space Ibrahim was declared his successor, but died
                    after a brief reign of two months.</p>
                <p>Mehemet Ali survived Ibrahim, and died on the 3d of August 1849. Many and
                    conflicting have been the opinions entertained of this remarkable man, for such
                    at least all acknowledge him to have been. His massacre of the Memlooks has been
                    the great point of attack by his enemies; but that, as well as many of his other
                    acts, must be ascribed to his boundless ambition, not to innate cruelty; for he
                    proved himself to be averse to unnecessary bloodshed. That he really esteemed
                    European civilization may be doubted; but his intelligent mind could not fail to
                    perceive that therein lay his great strength, and of this he availed himself
                    with consummate ability. To his firm government Egypt is indebted for the
                    profound tranquillity which it has long been its good fortune to enjoy. A
                    traveller of any nation oi∙ faith may traverse it in its length and breadth with
                    greater safety than almost any other country out of Western Europe; and the
                    display of fanaticism has been rigorously punished. While, however, Egypt has
                    benefited by the establishment of order, the people have suffered most severe
                    exactions. The confiscation of private lands has been before mentioned; to that
                    arbitrary act must be added the seizure of the lands of the mosques, the
                    imposition of heavy taxation, and a system of merciless impressment. In fact,
                    the condition of the Egyptian fell.4h has rarely been as wretched as it is at
                    the present day. Mehemet Ali also misunderstood the real resources of Egypt,
                    which are certainly agricultural; he dealt a severe blow to native produce by
                    endeavouring to encourage manufacturing industry, and by establishing enormous
                    Government monopolies, a measure which crushed the spirit of the agriculturists.
                    His military and governing abilities were assuredly very great, and his career
                    is almost unequalled in Turkish history. Had it not been for the intervention of
                    Great Britain, his Syrian successes over the Porte would probably have rescued
                    Egypt from the wretched condition of a Turkish province. But the firm&lt;∙in of
                    1841 entailed the loss of all his military power, the army was reduced to 18,000
                    men, and the navy condemned to rot in the harbour of Alexandria; while Mehemet
                    Ali, failing to gain the great object of his ambition, the establishment of an
                    independent dynasty, and being compelled to look on his then living family as
                    his only heirs, thenceforth confined himself to measures of less importance, and
                    did not prosecute even these with his former energy.</p>
                <p>The entire constitution of the government of Egypt is the work of Mehemet Ali.
                    With a few exceptions, he destroyed all former usages, and introduced a system
                    partly derived from European models. The army and navy are of his creation, so
                    are the taxation, the regulation of import and export duties, &amp;c.,
                    quarantine laws, the manufactories, colleges, and the ministry. Some of these
                    institutions are useful, others both vexatious and ill-calculated for the
                    country. The colleges of languages and medicine, and the printing-press at
                    Boolâk, are among the former, and are exceedingly praiseworthy efforts in a
                    right direction; and in the same category must be placed many minor
                    improvements, in which Mehemet Ali showed himself to be far in advance of his
                    countrymen; while, weighing his chequered life and numerous disadvantages of
                    position and nation, his moral character, enlightened mind, and distinguished
                    ability must place him high among the great men of modern times.<note

                <p>Ibrahim was succeeded by his nephew ’Abbas, son of Toosoon. This miserable
                    voluptuary, and withal bigoted though ignorant Muslim, utterly neglected the
                    affairs of government and solely consulted his own gratification. During bis
                    reign all the great works begun by Mehemet Ali were suspended. It was a time of
                    deliberate retrogression, and his sudden death in July 1854 was welcomed by all
                    true Egyptians as the removal of the country’s curse. His successor, Said Pasha,
                    the fourth son of Mehemet Ali, endeavoured to pursue his great father’s policy
                    and to carry out his aims. He had not, however, the strength of character or the
                    health needed to meet the serious difficulties of the task, and he will chiefly
                    be remembered for the abolition of some of the more grinding Government
                    monopolies, and for the concession of the Suez Canal. It was reserved for his
                    nephew, the present khedive, to attain all and more than all that Mehemet Ali
                    had designed for his country.</p>
                <p>The reign of Ismail promises to be the beginning of a new era for Egypt. A man of
                    undoubted ability, possessed of unusual energy in administration, fully
                    appreciative of the importance of Western civilization, fired with the ambition
                    proper to a grandson of Mehemet Ali, the khedive is a ruler such as Egypt has
                    scarcely seen since the Arab conquest. His first step was to remove, as far as
                    possible, the irksome control of the Porte. At great cost he obtained an
                    imperial firman in 186G, removing almost all the old treaty restrictions,
                    granting him the title of khedive <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0790-0767"/> (pron. khedeev), and settling the succession on
                    the eldest son; and in 1872 another firm&lt;4n made him virtually an independent
                    sovereign.</p>
                <p>Having thus obtained for himself and his dynasty a settled regal rank, Ismail
                    turned his attention homewards, and began a series of reforms such as no
                    previous governor of Egypt ever contemplated. He re-established and improved the
                    administrative system organized by Mehemet Ali, and which had fallen into decay
                    under 'Abbâs’s indolent rule; he caused a thorough remodelling of the customs
                    system, which was in an anarchic state, to be made by English officials; in 1865
                    he bought the Egyptian post-office, and placed it under the direction, with full
                    powers, of an official from St Martin’s le Grand, who has brought it into
                    admirable working order; he reorganized the military schools of his grandfather,
                    and lent his willing support to the cause of education in every way. Public
                    works have largely engaged the attention of the khedive. Railways, telegraphs,
                    lighthouses, the harbour works at Suez, the breakwater at Alexandria, have been
                    carried out under his personal auspices by some of the best contractors of
                    Europe. If there is a fault to be found in this Europeanizing of Egypt, it is
                    that the practical zeal for modern civilization leaves no room for the
                    honourable respect due to the unique antiquities of the country. It is true that
                    ancient Egypt is protected by the care of Mariette Bey, but the art of the Arabs
                    is suffered to decay, nay, is even purposely demolished, to make room for modern
                    French gewgaws. A recent writer tells us that a new street cuts through about a
                    mile of the “old Arab rookeries,” and gravely advances the opinion that the
                    opera house and the public gardens and the other meretricious abominations that
                    have been set up in Cairo are worthy of a second class European city! Still,
                    terrible as is the vandalism now going on in Egypt, there can be little doubt
                    that the present policy of the khedive will add greatly to the prosperity and
                    health of the people. At the same time, future generations will gain at the
                    fearful expense of the present. The funds required for these public works, as
                    well as the actual labour, have been remorselessly extorted from a
                    poverty-stricken population; and there is probably no peasant now existing whose
                    condition is w orse than that of the long-suffering Egyptian fellàh.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest reforms that Egypt owes to its present ruler is the abolition
                    of the old system of consular jurisdiction, and the substitution of mixed
                    courts, where European and native judges sit together to try all mixed cases
                    without respect to nationality. These courts were established in 1876 on the
                    suggestion of the wisest of Egypt’s statesmen, Nubar Pasha, and on the
                    recommendation of an international commission. A code based on the Muhammadan
                    law and the Code Napoléon has been drawn up, which seems thoroughly suited to
                    the needs of the position; and the best results may be looked for from this
                    reform. It were greatly to be desired that the jurisdiction of these courts
                    should be extended so as eventually to supersede the old native system. At
                    present they only take the place of the consular courts.</p>
                <p>In recent times the khedive has annexed a large territory to the south of
                    Khartoom, now extending about as far as Gondokoro, and which will doubtless
                    shortly include the lakes of Victoria and Albert Nyanza. The expedition was at
                    first commanded by Sir Samuel Baker, with very unsatisfactory results; and great
                    relief was felt when the continuation of the work of conquest was intrusted to
                    Colonel Gordon, an officer in whose character and ability the fullest confidence
                    is placed. The khedive has professed himself anxious to put down the Nile
                    slave-trade, and that he is really desirous of seeing the traffic ended is shown
                    by the full powers he has given Colonel Gordon for the suppression of it in the
                    heart of the slave-country. What the result will be it is hard to foretell; but
                    the good faith of the khedive and the determination of Colonel Gordon are now
                    beyond a doubt. Quite recently (Aug, 14, 1877) a convention between the British
                    and Egyptian Governments for the suppression of the slave-trade has been signed,
                    imposing stringent penalties on the importation of slaves into Egypt, and
                    extending the power of search in the case of suspected vessels.</p>

                    guide to the monuments during his residence in that country.</p></note></p>
                <p>The northern coast of Egypt is low and barren, presenting no features of
                    interest, and affording no indication of the character of the country which it
                    bounds. It is a barrier, generally of sand-hills, but sometimes of rock, for the
                    most part wholly destitute of vegetation, except where grow a few wild and
                    stunted date-palms. Immediately behind are desolate marshy tracts or extensive
                    salt lakes, and beyond, the fertile country. The last is a wide plain,
                    intersected by the two branches of the Nile, and by many canals, of which some
                    were anciently branches of the river, and having a soil of great richness,
                    though in this particular it is excelled by the valley above. The only
                    inequalities of the surface are the mounds of ancient towns, and those, often if
                    not always ancient, on which stand the modern towns and villages. The palm-trees
                    are less numerous, and not so beautiful as in the more southern part of the
                    country, but other trees are more common. The houses and huts of the towns and
                    villages are of burnt brick near the Mediterranean; but as the climate becomes
                    drier, and the occurrence of rain far less frequent, the use of crude brick
                    obtains, until near the point of the Delta it is very general. The mosques even
                    of the towns are rarely remarkable for architectural beauty in the tract to the
                    north of Cairo. The palaces or villas of the Turkish grandees, which are not
                    uncommon, have, however, a light and picturesque appearance, though their style
                    is not good. The deserts which inclose the plain on both sides are rocky tracts
                    of very slight elevation, having their surface overspread with sand and other
                    debris.</p>
                <p>Of the towns on the northern coast, the most western, Alexandria, called by the
                    natives El-Iskendereeyeh, is the largest and the most important. It was founded
                    in the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 332 by Alexander the Great, who gave
                    it the form of a Macedonian mantle (chlamys). The ancient city occupied the
                    space between the sea and Lake Mareotis, being about four miles in its greatest
                    length, and a little less than a mile in its greatest breadth. The island of
                    Pharos was likewise inhabited, and was joined to the continent by the mole
                    called the Heptastadium. The Heptastadium and the island divided the bay into
                    two harbours. These were spacious, and although the western, anciently called
                    Portus Eunosti, but now the Old Port, is difficult to enter, and the eastern,
                    Magnus Portus, or the New Port, is not so deep and is less secure, they are,
                    except Port Said, by far the best anchorages on this coast of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Alexandria, which partly occupied the site of the ancient Rhacotis, a place of
                    little importance, naturally speedily increased in consequence, and became the
                    emporium of the trade between Europe, Arabia, and India. After the death of
                    Alexander the city became the capital of the Ptolemies. By the Ptolemies
                    Alexandria was adorned with palaces and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n791/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0791-0768"/> of great magnificence, for which they did not
                    scruple to despoil more ancient edifices of some of their chiefest ornaments.
                    While its commercial importance increased, it became a celebrated seat of
                    learning, with the greatest library of antiquity, through the wise interest with
                    which the Greek kings regarded science and letters. Under the Ptolemies,
                    however, the inhabitants, who were chiefly Greeks, became very troublesome to
                    their rulers, like most commercial populations, and their turbulence was ill
                    restrained by the weakness of the later sovereigns of that line. From the time
                    of the Roman conquest, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 30, until it was taken by
                    the Arabs, <hi rend="smallcaps">λ.d.</hi> 641, Alexandria sensibly declined,
                    partly in consequence of its being a provincial capital, instead of a royal
                    residence, but chiefly because of the unruly disposition of its inhabitants, and
                    their violent religious and political disputes, which at last resulted in the
                    seat of government being transferred to the fortress of Egyptian Babylon, near
                    the modern Cairo, which became in some sort the capital. During this period it
                    had been distinguished for the learning of its ecclesiastics, and the strong
                    part which they took in the theological differences of the early church. Under
                    the Muslims Alexandria never regained the position of metropolis of Egypt, and
                    its importance, with some fluctuations, waned until the discovery and consequent
                    adoption of the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope almost withdrew the main
                    cause of its prosperity. Recently, however, the resumption of the overland route
                    has greatly benefited this city, and although it was not made the capital, it
                    became the favourite residence of Mehemet Ali, which in like manner contributed
                    to its welfare.</p>
                <p>The older part of the town of Alexandria stands upon the Heptastadium, now much
                    wider than it was anciently; but the recent part, where are the houses of the
                    European merchants, occupies the site of a portion of the ancient city, •which
                    was nearest to the mole. The most striking edifice is the castle on the island
                    of Pharos, containing a lighthouse, which has succeeded to the more famous
                    Pharos of antiquity. Here also is the pasha’s palace, as well as a lesser
                    Pharos. The houses of the town are built of stone, or have their lowest story
                    cased with that material, and the portion above built of brick plastered and
                    whitewashed. The residences of the European merchants and consuls and the richer
                    Turks and natives are spacious and well-built, somewhat in the modern Italian
                    style, but have no claims to architectural beauty. The mosques are not
                    remarkable, but the English church will, if ever completed, be a great ornament
                    to the town. The population of the town is estimated at over 200,000. One of the
                    favourite projects of Mehemet Ali was the fortification of Alexandria, which has
                    been thus rendered so strong that if well garrisoned it could not be invested by
                    a force of less than about 40,000 men.</p>
                <p>The ancient remaihs are very scanty and of little interest, compared to those
                    which are seen on the sites of other Egyptian towns. Two objects are
                    conspicuous, one of the obelisks commonly called “Cleopatra’s Needles,” and the
                    great column known aβ “Pompey’s Pillar.” The former is a fine obelisk of red
                    granite nearly 70 feet in height, bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions with the
                    names of Thothmes III., Ramses IL, and a later king. Beside it was a fallen
                    obelisk of the same dimensions, its fellow, now (Oct. 1877) on its way to
                    England. They were brought here from some ancient temple during the Roman rule.
                    Pompey’s Pillar is in like manner of red granite, and its shaft is about 70 feet
                    high, the whole column being nearly 100 feet in height. Its pedestal bears a
                    Greek inscription in honour of the emperor Diocletian.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to the east of Alexandria, the first place of importance is
                    Er-Rasheed, called by the Europeans Rosetta, a considerable town on the west
                    bank of the Rosetta branch of the Nile, anciently the Bolbitine. Before the
                    cutting by Mehemet Ali of the Mahmoodeeyeh Canal to connect Alexandria with this
                    branch of the river, Rosetta was a place of greater importance than now, as in
                    consequence of the decay of the old canal of Alexandria, the overland trade from
                    India chiefly passed through it. It is a well-built town, having some gardens,
                    and is in many respects more agreeable than Alexandria. Its population is stated
                    to be 15,000. A little to the north of the town is the boghâz, a bar of sand
                    stretching across the mouth of the river, and rendering it often impassable; and
                    between it and Rosetta is an old fort called Fort St Julien by the French, who
                    repaired it during their occupation of Egypt, when one of their officers
                    discovered the Rosetta Stone, the famous trilingual tablet which afforded the
                    clue by which hieroglyphics were interpreted.</p>
                <p>In ascending the Rosetta branch, the first place of interest is the site of Sais,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">saï,</hi> on the eastern bank, marked by lofty mounds, and
                    the remains of massive walls of crude brick, which were those of a great
                    inclosure in which the chief temple and doubtless other sacred edifices stood.
                    The goddess Nit or Neith was the divinity of the place, and a great festival was
                    annually hekl here in her honour, to which pilgrims resorted from other parts of
                    Egypt. Sals was remarkable for the learning of its priests, and was the royal
                    residence of the Salte kings (Dynasties XXIV., XXVI.) A modern village here is
                    called “Sà-el-Hagar,” or “Sals of the Stone,” a name which perhaps alludes to
                    the famous monolith described by Herodotus.</p>
                <p>In the interior of the modern Delta no remains of importance have been
                    discovered, though there are many ancient sites marked by mounds. The chief
                    towns are El-Mahalleh el-Kebeereh, not far from the Damietta brauch, about forty
                    miles from the sea; Tantà, nearly in the middle of the Delta; and Manoof,
                    farther south. Of these Tantà is best known as the birth-place of a Muslim
                    saint, the seyyid Ahmad El-Bedawee, in whose honour three festivals are annually
                    kept, the greatest of which attracts more pilgrims than any other in Egypt, and
                    is in this respect second alone to the pilgrimage to Mecca. The festivals of
                    Tantà are rather distinguished by riot than piety, and recall the revelries of
                    Bubastis and Canopus.</p>
                <p>Several places of interest are found on the course of the Damietta branch, the
                    old Phatnitic or Pathmetic. First of these is the town whence it takes its name,
                    Dimyât, called by the Europeans Damietta, which stands not far from the mouth of
                    the branch, on its eastern side. In the time of the crusades it was a strong
                    place, and regarded as the key of Egypt. It was taken and retaken by the
                    contending forces, and formed the. basis of the operations of St Louis in the
                    unfortunate eighth crusade. Shortly afterwards the sultan Edh-Dhàhir Beybars, in
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1251, razed it and rebuilt it on the present site
                    somewhat farther from the sea. It is a flourishing town, and has a population of
                    29,000 inhabitants. The next place of importance is the town of El-Mansoorah,
                    founded by El-Melik El-Kâmil, the nephew of Saladin, during the sixth crusade,
                    to commemorate, as its name imports, his success over the invading army of Jean
                    de Brienne. A little to the south of El-Mansoorah, on the opposite or western
                    bank, at a short distance from the river, are the remains of a very remarkable
                    temple of the goddess Isis, and the mounds of the town of Iseum. Although the
                    temple is entirely thrown down, as though by a natural convulsion, but probably
                    by human violence, its plan may be partly traced and its date ascertained, as
                    the materials have not been removed. It was, unlike most Egyptian temples, built
                    altogether of granite, and was about 600 feet in length and 200 in breadth. The
                    materials must have been transported <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n792/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0792-0769"/> from Syene, a distance by the river, on which
                    they were doubtless floated, of more than 600 miles. Bearing in mind this
                    circumstance, and the difficulty of both working and sculpturing so hard a
                    material, this temple must be considered to be one of the most costly in the
                    country. The earliest name which has been found here is that of Nekht-har-heb
                    (Dynasty XXX. ), but the most common one is that of Ptolemy Philadelphus. A
                    little to the south of this site, on the same bank, is the small town of
                    Semennood, anciently Sebennytus; and a short distance farther, on the same side,
                    is the village of Aboo-Seer, the ancient Busiris, named after Osiris, who, with
                    Isis, was here worshipped. Herodotus mentions among the great festivals that of
                    Isis held at Busiris, but this was more probably kept at Iseum, which was not
                    far. For a long distance there is nothing of interest until we reach Tel-Atreeb,
                    where the site of the town of Athribis is marked by high mounds, with remains of
                    ancient houses and some blocks of stone.</p>
                <p>To the eastward of the Damietta branch, in the broad cultivated tract or the
                    desert beyond, are some places worthy of note. The most eastern of these is the
                    site of Pelusium, which was, in the times of the Pharaohs of Dynasty XXVI., the
                    key of Egypt towards Palestine. No important remains have been discovered here.
                    Between this site and the Damietta branch are the mounds of Tanis, or Zoan, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">z’an, zar,</hi> where are considerable remains of the great
                    temple, the most remarkable of which are several fallen obelisks, some of which
                    are broken. From their inscriptions, and those of other blocks, it has been
                    ascertained that the temple was as ancient as the time of Dynasty XII., and -was
                    much beautified by Ramses II. and other kings of that time and the subsequent
                    period. Tanis was on the eastern bank of the Tanitic branch of the Nile, now
                    called the Canal of the El-Mo’izz. On the same side of the same branch, but far
                    to the south, was the city of Bubastis, <hi rend="smallcaps">pe-bast,</hi> the
                    site of which is indicated by very lofty mounds, in which may be traced the
                    remains of its great temple, which was entirely of red granite. Here was held
                    the festival of the goddess Bast, or Bubastis, which attracted great crowds of
                    pilgrims, and is ranked by Herodotus first of the festivals of Egypt. Not far
                    south, and on the borders of the desert, is Bilbeys, which was a place of some
                    importance as a frontier-town in the time of the Eiyoobee princes. Still farther
                    south are the mounds of Onion, the Jewish city founded by the high priest Onias,
                    where was a temple closed by Vespasian not long after the overthrow of
                    Jerusalem. The site is called Tell-el-Yahoodeeyeh, or “The Mound of the
                    Jewess.”</p>
                <p>At the point of the Delta is the unfinished barrage, which, by crossing both
                    branches of the river, will regulate the inundation above and below this point.
                    The river here becomes broader than in its divided state, and long continues so.
                    A little south of the point of the Delta, on the eastern bank of the river, near
                    the village of El-Matareeyeh, not far north of Cairo, is the site of the ancient
                    Heliopolis, or On, <hi rend="smallcaps">an,</hi> the City of the Sun, marked by
                    a solitary obelisk, and crude brick ridges formed by the ruins of a massive
                    wall. The obelisk bears the name of Usurtesen I., the second king of Dynasty
                    XII., in the simple inscription which runs down each of its sides. It is of red
                    granite, and nearly 70 feet in height. The city was famous rather for the
                    learning of its college than for its size, and the temple of the sun was held in
                    high veneration. Many famous Greek philosophers studied here, and much of their
                    earliest knowledge of natural science was no doubt derived from their Egyptian
                    instructors.</p>
                <p>Boolâk, the port of Cairo, is a flourishing town, having two remarkable mosques.
                    It was built <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> 713, in the reign of the sultan
                    Mohammad Ibn Kalâ-oon. Here M. Mariette has founded the national “Musée Boulaq,”
                    a splendid collection of Egyptian antiquities.</p>
                <p>Cairo is the fourth Muslim capital of Egypt; the site of one of those that have
                    preceded it is, for the most part, included within its walls, while the other
                    two were a little to the south. ’Amr, the Muslim conqueror of the country,
                    founded El-Fustât, the oldest of these, close to the fortress of Egyptian
                    Babylon, the seat of government at that time. Its name signifies “the Tent,” as
                    it was built where ’Amr had pitched his tent. The new town speedily became a
                    place of importance, and vas the residence of the Nâïbs, or lieutenants,
                    appointed by the orthodox and Ommiade caliphs. It received the name of Masr,
                    properly Misr, which was also applied by the Arabs to Memphis and to Cairo. It
                    declined after the foundation of El-Kâhireh, but never became altogether
                    deserted, for a small town, called Masr El-’Ateekah, or “Old Masr,” occupies, in
                    the present day, part of what was its area in its time of prosperity. Shortly
                    after the overthrow of the Ommiade Dynasty, and the establishment of the
                    ’Abbâsee, the city of El-’Askar was founded <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.h.</hi> 133)
                    by Suleymân, the general who subjugated the country, and became the capital and
                    the residence of the successive lieutenants of the ’Abbâsee caliphs. El- ’Askar
                    was a small town adjacent to El-Fustât, of which it was a kind of suburb. Its
                    site is now entirely desolate. The third capital, El-Katâë’, or El-Katâyë’, was
                    founded about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> 2GO, by Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon, as his
                    capital. It continued the royal residence of his successors; but not long after
                    the fall of the dynasty, and the subsequent Ikhsheedees, the seat of government
                    was transferred by the Fâtimees to a new city, El-Kâhireh. El-Katâë’, which had
                    been sacked on the overthrow of the Tooloonees, rapidly decayed. A part of the
                    present Cairo occupies its site, and contains its great mosque, that of Ahmad

                <p>Gôhar el-Kâïd, the conqueror of Egypt for the Fâtimee caliph El-Mo’izz, founded a
                    new capital, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> 358, which waβ named El-Kâhireh,
                    that is, “the Victorious,” a name corrupted into Cairo. This town occupied about
                    a fourth part, the north-eastern, of the present metropolis. By degrees it
                    became greater than El-Fustât, and took from it the name of Misr, or Masr, which
                    is applied to it by the modern Egyptians. It continually increased, so as to
                    include the site of El-Katâë’ to the south, and of the old town of El-Maks to
                    the west. The famous Saladin built the Citadel on the lowest point of the
                    mountain to the east, which immediately overlooked El-Katâë’, and he partly
                    walled round the towns and large gardens within the space now called Cairo.
                    Under the prosperous rule of the Memlook sultans this great tract was filled
                    with habitations; a large suburb to the north, the Hoseyneeyeh, was added; and
                    the town of Boolâk was founded. After the Turkish conquest <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.d.</hi> 1517) the metropolis decayed, but its limits were the same; with the
                    present dynasty it has somewhat recovered.</p>
                <p>Cairo is of an irregular oblong form. Its greatest length is about three miles,
                    and its average breadth about a mile and a half, and its dimensions do not fall
                    very much short of these in any part. M. Jacotin <hi rend="italic">{Description

                    square miles. This surface is not, however, entirely occupied by houses, for it
                    contains the Citadel and various extensive gardens and open spaces, as well as
                    lakes. Most of the streets are extremely narrow, and the markets generally
                    crowded, so that the stranger usually acquires a delusive idea of the density of
                    the population. Mr Lane states the population to have been 240,000 before the
                    great plague of 1835, and adds that the deficiency, equal to not less than
                    one-third of the inhabitants, caused by that terrible visitation, would be
                    speedily supplied from the villages. <hi rend="italic">{Modern Egyptians,</hi>

                    at about 200,000; and Mrs Poole, writing in 1842, estimates it at about 240,000
                    <hi rend="italic">(Englishwoman in Egypt,</hi> i. 136); but Clot-Bey <hi

                    appeared in 1840, states the much higher amount of about 300,000 souls. The
                    census of 1847-8 states the more moderate number of 253,541 inhabitants, and in
                    this instance it is not likely to have been far wrong. We may fairly suppose
                    that during the time of comparative prosperity that followed the great plague of
                    1835, the population gradually increased to about 250,000, and that the cholera
                    in 1848, and the conscriptions occasioned by the Crimean War, somewhat
                    diminished its amount, which in the subsequent time of peace rose to the present
                    sum of about 350,000. Of the population of 240,000, in Mr Lane’s estimate, about
                    190,000 were Muslim Egyptians, about 10,000 Copts, 3000 or 4000 Jews, and the
                    rest, strangers from various countries. The adult male population was about
                    one-third of the whole, or 80,000 persons, of whom 30,000 were merchants, petty
                    shopkeepers, and artisans, 20,000 domestic servants, and 15,000 common
                    labourers, porters, &amp;c.; the remainder chiefly consisting of military and
                    civil servants of the Government. <hi rend="italic">(Modem Egyptians, l.</hi>

                <p>Cairo is still the most remarkable and characteristic of Arab cities. The beauty
                    of its religious and domestic architecture, before the recent innovations, is
                    unexcelled elsewhere. The edifices raised by the Moorish kings of Spain and the
                    Muslim rulers of India may have been more splendid in their materials, and more
                    elaborate in their details; the houses of the great men of Damascus may be more
                    costly than were those of the Memlook beys; but for purity of taste and elegance
                    of design both are far excelled by many of the mosques and houses of Cairo.
                    These mosques have suffered much in the beauty of their appearance from the
                    effects of time and neglect; but their colour has been often thus softened, and
                    their outlines rendered the more picturesque. What is most to be admired in
                    their style of architecture is its extraordinary freedom from restraint, shown
                    in the wonderful variety of its forms, and the skill in design which has made
                    the most intricate details to harmonize with grand outlines. Here the student
                    may best learn the history of Arab art. Like its contemporary Gothic, it has
                    three great periods, those of growth, maturity, and decline. Of the first, the
                    mosque of Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon in the southern part of Cairo, and the three great
                    gates of El-Kahireh (the old city), the Bab-en-Nasr, Bab-el-Futooh, and
                    Bab-Zuweyleh, are splendid examples. The leading forms are simple and massive,
                    with in the mosque horse-shoe arches. The decoration is in friezes, and its
                    details of conventionalized foliage. The second period passes from the highest
                    point to which this art attained to a luxuriance promising decay. The mosque of
                    Sultan Hasan, below the Citadel, those of Mueiyad and Kalâ-oon, with the
                    Barkookeyeh, in the main street of the old city, and the mosque of Barkook in
                    the Cemetery of Kâït Bey, are instances of the earlier and best style of this
                    period. The forms, though still massive, are less simple, and they are admirably
                    adapted to the necessities of space. The decoration is in conventionalized
                    foliage of the most free forms, balanced by exquisite geometrical patterns. Of
                    the last style of this period, the Ghooreeyeh, iu the main street of the old
                    city, and the mosque of Kilt Bey in his cemetery, are beautiful specimens. They
                    show an elongation of forms and an excess of decoration in which the florid
                    qualities predominate. Of the age of decline the finest monument is the mosque
                    of Mohammad Bey Aboo-Dahab, in the old city. The forms are now poor, though not
                    lacking in grandeur, and the details are not as well adjusted as before, with a
                    want of mastery of the most suitable decoration. The usual plau of a
                    congregational mosque is a large, square, open court, surrounded by colonnades,
                    of which the chief, often with more rows of columns, faces Mecca (eastward), and
                    has inside its outer wall a decorated niche to mark the direction of prayer. In
                    the centre is a fountain for ablutions, often surmounted by a dome, and in the
                    eastern colonnade a pulpit and a desk for readers. When a mosque is also the
                    founder’s tomb, it has a richly ornamented sepulchral chamber. Of domestic
                    architecture there are a few precious fragments before the age of decline; but
                    most specimens are of the latest period of that age. These are marked by a
                    singular fitness and great elegance in the interiors. The decoration, though
                    inferior to that of the mosques of the best style, is charming for variety and
                    beauty of pattern. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cairo,</hi> and also <hi

                <p>To the east of Cairo is a bold spur of the mountains known as El-Gebel
                    El-Mukattam. Beneath it, and to the north of the Citadel, is the Cemetery of
                    Kâït Bey, remarkable for the splendid tombs of the Memlook sultans. The most
                    beautiful of these is that of Kàït Bey, from which the cemetery takes its name,
                    but those of the sultan Barkook and of El-Ghooree must not be passed by
                    unmentioned. At a little distance to the north-east is the Gebel-el-Ahmar, or
                    “Red Mountain,” and southward of this, petrified wood in large quantities is
                    seen strewn on the surface of the desert. The space between Cairo and the Nile,
                    varying from a mile to a mile and a half in breadth, is occupied by plantations
                    which were made by Ibrahim Pasha during Ids father’s rule. Formerly this side of
                    the city was, as the other three are still partially, bounded by lofty mounds of
                    rubbish; these he caused to be removed, and by doing so conferred a great
                    benefit upon the inhabitants, as well as by planting with trees the intervening
                    space. By irrigating this tract very freely with a steam-engine he considerably
                    lessened the good he had effected, rendering the western part of the city
                    somewhat damp. To t·he south of Cairo is a great cemetery containing the tomb of
                    the Iraâm Esh-Shâfe’ee, and also an aqueduct, built by the sultan El-Ghooree,
                    which conducts water from the Nile to the Citadel; and further south, the Roman
                    fortress of Egyptian Babylon, now called Kasr-esh-Shema, at present chiefly
                    occupied by a Coptic convent, as well as the small town of Masr El-’Ateekah,
                    which is all that remains of the famous metropolis El-Fustàt. It contains no
                    remarkable edifices: in its immediate neighbourhood, however, is the oldest
                    mosque in Egypt, that of ’Amr, the Muslim conqueror, but it has been so
                    frequently repaired and almost rebuilt that it is impossible to form any idea of
                    its original appearance. Opposite to Masr El-’Ateekah, from which it is
                    separated by a very narrow branch of the Nile, is the island of Er-Rôdah,
                    containing the famous Mikyâs, or Nilomcter.</p>
                <p>The chief place on the western bank near Cairo is the small town of El-Geezeh,
                    opposite Masr El-’Ateekah. El-Geezeh is best known as having given its name to
                    the most famous group of Pyramids, the chief monuments of Memphis, which stand
                    on the slightly elevated border of the low Libyan range, not more than a quarter
                    of a mile oeyond the limit of the cultivated land.</p>
                <p>The city of Memphis, <hi rend="smallcaps">men-nofer,</hi> “the good station,”
                    stood on the western bank of the Nile about ten miles above Cairo. It was
                    founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt. The kings and people who dwelt there
                    chose the nearest part of the desert as their burial-place, and built tombs on
                    its rocky edge, or excavated them in its sides. The kings raised pyramids around
                    which their subjects were buried in comparatively small sepulchres. The pyramids
                    were grouped together, and often there is a long distauce from one group to
                    another. Although many pyramids have been nearly or wholly destroyed, yet, as
                    the largest undoubtedly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n794/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0794-0771"/> remain, the general features of the necropolis
                    cannot be much changed. From the Citadel of Cairo we obtain a good view of the
                    several groups. First, opposite to us, but a little to the south, are the three
                    great Pyramids of El-Geezeh, two of which exceed all the others in magnitude; at
                    some distance farther south we see those of Aboo-Seer, likewise three in number,
                    of smaller dimensions, and, not so far beyond them, the great Pyramid of
                    Sakkârah, called from its form that of Steps, with smaller pyramids in its
                    neighbourhood. Farthest of all, after a wider interval, are the two large
                    Pyramids of Dahshoor, which approach iu size the two great structures of
                    El-Geezeh. There are more to the south as far as the Feiyoom, the last being
                    that of El-Lahoon, but none above the Pyramids of Dahshoor can be included
                    within the Memphite necropolis. That great tract extended, if we measure from
                    the ruined Pyramid of Aboo-Ruweysh, somewhat to the north of those of El-Geezeh,
                    to the southernmost Pyramid of Dahshoor, throughout a space of nearly twenty
                    miles, in almost every part of which some sepulchres have been discovered, while
                    it cannot be doubted that many more await a fortunate explorer.</p>
                <p>The road to the pyramids of El-Geezeh from the town is through cultivated fields
                    diversified by villages in palmgroves. As we approach them, these structures do
                    not give us that idea of size that we had expected from our first distant view;
                    and until we stand at their feet we do not appreciate their vastness. But as we
                    endeavour to scan the height of the Great Pyramid, when about to begin its
                    ascent, we fully realize a result that human labour has not achieved elsewhere.
                    The very dimensions (a height of about half a thousand feet, four sides each
                    measuring the seventh of a mile) are in themselves gigantic; but when we know
                    that this huge space is almost solid, containing a few chambers so small as not
                    to be worthy of consideration in calculating its contents, we discover that no
                    monuments of man’s raising elsewhere afford any scale by which to estimate its
                    greatness. The Pyramids, except one or more small ones, were tombs of kings.
                    Each had its name and a priest attached to it, for whose functions there was a
                    chapel at some distance in front of the entrance.</p>
                <p>The Great Pyramid, “the Splendid,” was the mausoleum of Khufu, or Cheops, of
                    Dynasty IV. The present perpendicular height of the structure is, according to
                    General Vyse, 450 feet 9 inches, and the side of its present base 746 feet. It
                    is about 30 feet lower than it was originally, in consequence of the casing
                    stones and much of the outer masonry having been torn off; and its base is
                    likewise smaller. General Vyse gives the former height at 480 feet 9 inches, and
                    the side of the former base at 7 64 feet. Like all the other pyramids, it faces
                    the cardinal points. At the completion of the pyramid the faces were smooth and
                    polished, but now they present a series of great steps formed by the courses of
                    stone, and are in some places (particularly in the middle of each face, and at
                    the angles, and about the entrance) much broken. The ascent is easy though
                    fatiguing, and the traveller is amply rewarded by the view which he obtains from
                    the platform, about 32 feet square, at the summit. The prospect of the fertile
                    plain and valley on the one side, and of the undulating barren surface of the
                    Great Desert on the other, as well as of the pyramids and tombs beneath, is
                    alike remarkable from its character and the associations which it calls up. The
                    examination of the interior is no less interesting. All other tombs but the
                    Memphite pyramids, and those which were simply pits, were not closed, the upper
                    chamber being intended for the performance of funeral rites when the family of
                    the deceased visited his sepulchre. These pyramids, however, were most carefully
                    closed. The chambers which contained the bodies of the king, and of those
                    (doubtless of his family) who were sometimes buried in the same structure, are
                    without sculptures, and scarcely ornamented in any way, being usually wholly
                    plain. The passages leading to them are only large enough to admit a
                    sarcophagus, and after the king’s burial were closed by the lowering of heavy
                    stone portcullises, and the blocking up of the entrance. The desired object was
                    security, and we must not, therefore, expect beauty or grandeur in chambers
                    constructed for this purpose, although we cannot fail to admire their massive
                    and gloomy aspect.</p>
                <p>The entrance of the Great Pyramid is not far from the middle of the northern
                    face, 49 feet in perpendicular height from the base. The fallen stones and
                    rubbish have, however, raised a mound which reaches nearly to the entrance, the
                    masonry about which having been torn down, we gain some idea of the construction
                    of the pyramid. In this manner the passage has lost somewhat of its length. The
                    passage itself is 3 feet 11 inches high, and 3 feet 5⅜ inches wide, and is lined
                    with fine limestone. It descends at an angle of 26° 4Γ.<note anchored="true"

                    they were always closed at the completion of the buildings, show that the fact
                    of this one’s having pointed, at a supposed date of its erection, to <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> Draconis, which wa then the pole-star, is not to be
                    regarded as more than accidental. Nevertheless, as above mentioned, the pyramids
                    face the cardinal points.</p></note> At a distance of 63 feet 2 inches from the
                    beginning of the roof of the present entrance, α second passage commences from
                    this, taking an ascending direction. The entrance of this new passage is
                    obstructed by great blocks of granite which entirely fill it, and have been
                    passed by mcaus of an excavation around them. We thus enter the ascending
                    passage, which is of the same breadth and height as the former, and inclines at
                    an angle of 26° 18'. The stones which line its roof and sides are very rough,
                    and it has evidently been left unfinished. After ascending this passage for a
                    distance of 109 feet 7 inches, we reach the Grand Passage, which, from its
                    greater dimensions, presents a comparatively imposing appearance. It ascends at
                    the same angle as the last, while a horizontal passage runs beneath it to a
                    chamber to be subsequently mentioned. Just within the Grand Passage is the mouth
                    of the Well, an irregular pit, partly excavated in the rock, leading to the
                    lower portion of the first passage. Its object was probably to afford an exit to
                    the workmen who had been engaged in closing the ascending passage. The Grand
                    Passage is 6 feet 10 inches in w idth at its base, 28 feet high, and 156 feet
                    long. The blocks which compose its sides gradually approach, every course above
                    the second projecting a little, and on each side is a stone bench. At the end of
                    this passage a horizontal one begins, of much smaller but unequal dimensions,
                    and 22 feet 1 inch in length, leading to the Grand Chamber, commonly called the
                    King’s Chamber, which it enters at the eastern end of its north side. This,
                    which is the principal sepulchral chamber (unless, indeed, there be an
                    undiscovered one of greater importance), is lined with red granite, and measures
                    in length 34 feet 3 inches, in width 17 feet 1 inch, and in height 19 feet 1
                    inch. It is altogether plain, and contains only a sarcophagus of red granite,
                    which is equally unadorned. Above this chamber are five small ones, which may be
                    called entresols, evidently designed to lighten the pressure of the
                    superincumbent masonry, particularly as the uppermost of them has a pointed
                    roof. Four of these were discovered by the late General Howard Vyse, who found
                    in them quarry-marks, bearing, in two varieties, the name of Khufu, the royal
                    builder of the pyramid. These chambers are reached with difficulty, and chiefly
                    by forced passages. The horizontal passage beneath the Grand Passage must now be
                    described. This is but 3 feet 10 inches high, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n795/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0795-0772"/> 3 feet 5⅛ inches wide, for the first 92 feet of
                    its length, and then we descend a step and find the passage to be 5 feet 8
                    inches high for 17 feet 11 inches farther, until it enters the “Queen’s
                    Chamber,” as it is usually called, at the eastern corner of its north side. This
                    chamber is 18 feet 9 inches long, and 17 feet broad, and its extreme height is
                    20 feet 3 inches. It has a pointed roof, of great blocks of stone, inclined
                    upwards and meeting in the middle. Within it is the entrance of a forced
                    passage. The remainder of the first passage, beyond where the first ascending
                    passage leads to the most interesting parts of the structure, is still to be
                    noticed. It continues below the forced entrance to the ascending passage for a
                    distance of 239 feet 10 inches, being cut through the rock on which the pyramid
                    is built. For this space its inclination and proportions do not change, but it
                    then becomes horizontal for 27 feet, terminating at the entrance of an excavated
                    chamber 46 feet in length, and 27 feet 1 inch in breadth, but of irregular and
                    inconsiderable height. There is no doubt that this chamber was left unfinished
                    at the closing of the pyramid. Beyond it the passage continues, opposite to
                    where it entered the chamber, and extends horizontally 52 feet 9 inches into the
                    rock in the same direction.</p>
                <p>The Second Pyramid, which bore the name of “the Great,” and was the tomb of
                    Khafra, or Chephren (Dynasty IV.), stands at a short distance to the south-west
                    of the Great Pyramid, which does not very much exceed it in magnitude, though
                    far superior in its construction. It has a base of 690 feet 9 inches square, and
                    is 447 feet 6 inches in height, being more steep than its larger neighbour. A
                    great part of its casing having been preserved, extending about a fourth of the
                    distance from the summit, the ascent is very difficult, especially as when one
                    has climbed on to the cased portion he can see nothing of the lower part of the
                    building, and thus feels as if upon a pyramid in the air. There are two
                    entrances, both in the north side, from which, and other peculiarities, it is
                    possible that the building was originally much smaller than now, and that, after
                    its first completion, it was enlarged, and a new entrance and sepulchral chamber
                    added.</p>
                <p>The Third Pyramid, “the Superior,” the tomb of Menkaura, or Mycerinus, is almost
                    in a line with the other two, and of much smaller dimensions, being only 203
                    feet in height, and 354 feet 6 inches square at the base. It is constructed
                    beautifully, and in a costly manner, and in these respects is unexcelled, if
                    equalled, by any other pyramid. The exterior was anciently cased altogether, or
                    iu part, with granite, but this has been generally torn off. General Vyse opened
                    it, and found that it had been previously ransacked. In it he discovered a very
                    beautiful sarcophagus (which was unfortunately lost at sea on its way to
                    England), as well as part of a mummy-case, bearing the name of King Menkaura,
                    and a mummy, not certainly the king’s, both of which are now in the British
                    Museum. This confirms the statement of Herodotus that it was the tomb of
                    Mycerinus. Manetho says that it was built by Queen Nitocris (Dynasty VI.). This
                    apparent inconsistency is explained, as Bunsen remarks <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Egypt's Place,</hi> ii. 165, <hi rend="italic">seq.,</hi> 210, <hi
                    rend="italic">seq.},</hi> by the construction of the pyramid, which has two
                    principal chambers, and was evidently enlarged after its first completion, so
                    that we may reasonably suppose that it is the sepulchre of both Mencheres and
                    Queen Nitocris.</p>
                <p>Near the three large pyramids are six smaller ones; three of these arc near the
                    east side of the Great Pyramid, and three on the south side of the Third
                    Pyramid. They were probably the tombs of near relations of the kings who founded
                    the great pyramids. The space around the pyramids is occupied by very numerous
                    tombs, some built of stone, others excavated in the sides of the rock on which
                    the pyramids stand, while others are simply pits with sepulchral chambers
                    leading from them. The most interesting of these occupy a square bounded on the
                    east by the Great Pyramid and on the south by the Second, and are mostly the
                    sepulchres of the subjects of Khufu and other kings of Dynasties IV. and V.
                    These tombs, which are of inconsiderable dimensions in comparison with many at
                    Thebes and elsewhere, are all built of stone, and have inclined walls, so as to
                    resemble truncated pyramids. They usually contain a chapel, or more rarely
                    chapels, the walls of which are decorated with most remarkable painted
                    sculptures, portraying the everyday life of the Egyptians at that remote age,
                    with short inscriptions of an explanatory character. The absence of
                    representations of the gods and subjects clearly connected with religion is
                    noteworthy. Other similar tombs stand to the east and south of the Great
                    Pyramid; and in the former direction are the principal sepulchral grottoes hewn
                    iu the side of the elevated rocky tract on which the pyramids stand. Some of
                    these excavations bear similar representations to those of the other tombs
                    already mentioned. To the east of the Second Pyramid is the Great Sphinx, called
                    in Egyptian “hu,” emblem of Hor-em-akhu, “Horus in the horizon,” one of the most
                    characteristic monuments of this wonderful necropolis, of an earlier date than
                    the Great Pyramid. It is a recumbent androsphinx, or man-headed lion, 188 feet
                    9∣ inches in length, hewn out of a natural eminence in the solid rock, some
                    defects of which are supplied by a partial stone-casing, the legs being likewise
                    added. Steps lead down to its front, where are a sanctuary and tablets, but
                    these are covered by the sand, which, after the hollow has been cleared,
                    speedily fills it again. Not far to the westward of the Sphinx is the remarkable
                    excavation known as Campbell’s Tomb, discovered by General Vyse, chiefly
                    consisting of a large pit surrounded by a trench. The causeways leading to the
                    Great Pyramid and to the Third, the former of which greatly excited the
                    admiration of Herodotus, are well worthy of a careful examination. The only
                    pyramid which stands to the north of this group is that of Aboo-Ruweysh, which
                    is in so ruined a condition as scarcely to deserve a visit. It lies about five
                    miles to the north of the Great Pyramid.</p>
                <p>Southward of the Pyramids of El-Geezeh, the first objects of interest are those
                    forming the similar group of Aboo-Seer, of much smaller dimensions, the largest
                    being about the size of the Third Pyramid. They are on the elevated edge of the
                    Libyan chain, about seven miles from the Third Pyramid, and are four in number,
                    three being large, and the fourth very small. The Northern Pyramid of Aboo-Seer
                    appears to have been the tomb of Sahura of Dynasty V., and the Middle Pyramid is
                    the tomb of Ra-n-user of the same line.</p>
                <p>About two miles farther in the same direction are the Pyramids of Sakkârah, the
                    greatest and most remarkable of which is called the Pyramid of Steps. The tract
                    around them appears from the number of the tombs to have been the principal
                    burial place of Memphis, to which it is near. The Pyramid of Steps has a height
                    of 196 feet 6 inches, and its base formerly measured on the north and south
                    sides 351 feet 2 inches, and on the east and west 393 feet 11 inches. Within it
                    are numerous passages and a gallery, which must, for the most part, have been
                    made subsequently to the completion of the structure. In the centre is a very
                    lofty and narrow chamber, and near it a small one, which was lined with blue
                    tiles. In the latter was an inscription containing the title of the bulls Apis.
                    Under the old monarchy those sacred animals were here entombed. It is thought
                    that this pyramid was constructed by Uenephes of Dynasty I. If Manetho be
                    correct in assigning the introduction of the worship of Apis to a later king,
                    this <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0796-0773"/> pyramid, if of Uenephes,was originally a royal
                    sepulchre. In the tract between the Pyramids of Sakkârah and Aboo-Seer are the
                    remains of the Sarapeum, and the burialplace of the bulls Apis, both discovered
                    by M. Mariette. They are inclosed by a great wall, having been connected, for
                    the Sarapeum was the temple of the defunct Apis. The tombs are in subterranean
                    galleries or in separate excavations which contain many sarcophagi, in which the
                    bulls were entombed. Not the least important result of this discovery is the
                    certainty that Sarapis was a form of Osiris, and that his name was Hesiri-hâpi,
                    or Osiris-Apis (Brugsch, <hi rend="italic">Reiseberichte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aιιs</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegypten,</hi> 27, <hi rend="italic">seqqf,</hi> as
                    Sir Gardner Wilkinson had long previously suggested <hi rend="italic">(Materia
                    Hiero-gtyphica,</hi> 21, and Vocab. MS. addition). The other pyramids are of
                    comparatively little interest. There are also some curious private tombs, among
                    which may be particularized a large grotto excavated in the face of the rock
                    overlooking the valley, which is remarkable for being vaulted on the principle
                    of the true arch, but without a key-stone. It is of the time of Psammetichus I.
                    of Dynasty XXVI., being, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks, one of the two
                    earliest known examples of the arch in stone, though, as he adds, there are
                    brick arches at Thebes of the time of Amenophis I. of Dynasty XVIII. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Modem Egypt and Thebes,</hi> i. 368-9).</p>
                <p>The site of Memphis is marked by mounds in the cultivated tract to the east of
                    the Pyramids of Sakkârah, and near the village of Meet-Rabeeneh. Of the great
                    temple of Ptah, its tutelary divinity, there are no remains above ground, except
                    a few blocks of stone and some broken statues, one of which is a fine colossus
                    of Ramses II., which most probably stood in ancient times before one of the
                    principal entrances of the temple. It is of white chert, and beautifully
                    executed, representing the king in a standing posture. It has fallen to the
                    ground, and has lost part of its legs; nevertheless it has suffered
                    inconsiderable damage elsewhere, so as to be still one of the finest specimens
                    of Egyptian art. The original height was more than 40 feet. This colossus is the
                    property of the British nation, but no steps have been taken to remove it to
                    this country. As Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks, “when the Turks have burnt it
                    for lime, it will be regretted” <hi rend="italic">(Modem Egypt and Thebes,</hi>
                    i. 373). The site of Memphis being in the cultivated tract, and near the modern
                    capitals of Egypt, its monuments have alike suffered from the destructive power
                    of nature, and from the barbarism of those who have used them as quarries or
                    defaced them from motives of fanaticism. The Pyramids have not escaped man’s
                    violence, but their vastnes3 has generally defied his attacks.</p>
                <p>At a distance of about five miles to the south of the Pyramid of Steps is the
                    northernmost of the Pyramids of Dahshoor, an interesting group, of the history
                    of which nothing certain is known. To their north is a vast truncated pyramid,
                    the sepulchre of Unas, last king of Dynasty V., anciently called “the Most
                    Beautiful Place,” now Mastabat Faraoon, or “Pharaoh’s Seat.” Two of the Pyramids
                    of Dahshoor are of stone, and three of crude brick. The former exceed in size
                    all the other pyramids except the First and Second of El-Geezeh, and have
                    remarkable chambers within them. The Northern Stone Pyramid has a base of 700
                    feet, and a height of 326 feet 6 inches, and has lost somewhat of its size,
                    having originally measured 719 feet 5 inches, and 342 feet 7 inches. Some of the
                    casing remains. It has an entrance in the northern face, leading to three
                    chambers of similar construction to the Grand Passage in the Great Pyramid. The
                    Southern Stone Pyramid is distinguished by the peculiarity of its form and by
                    having two entrances, one in the eastern face and the other in the northern. The
                    lower portion has an angle of 54* 14' 46'', but the inclination then changes to
                    42° 59' 26.'' It has been supposed that it was suddenly completed, having been
                    originally planned to be much loftier, but the method in which the pyramids were
                    built renders this unlikely; and it seems rather to have been given this form to
                    gratify a whim of the founder, especially as the entrances in different faces
                    afford another peculiarity. Its base is 615 feet 8 inches, and its height 319
                    feet 6 inches. At its southern side is a small brick pyramid. The Northern and
                    Southern Brick Pyramids of Dahshoor are to the east of those already described.
                    They are now in a very ruined state, being merely mounds of crude brick; one of
                    them is probably the Pyramid of Asychis mentioned by Herodotus.</p>
                <p>Among the earlier explorers of the necropolis of Memphis was Belzoni, by whom the
                    Second Pyramid was opened. General Howard Vyse first undertook a complete
                    examination of the series of pyramids, and having secured the assistance of Mr
                    Perring, carried out this project with well-merited success. Professor Lepsius,
                    the head of the Prussian expedition, opened many tombs in the Memphite
                    necropolis, and has published in his magnificent work <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien)</hi> the most interesting sculptures
                    which they contain. M. Mariette, aided by the French Government, discovered the
                    Sarapeum and the tombs of the bulls Apis, and has since continued his researches
                    under the authority of the khedive.</p>
                <p>The voyage up the Nile from Cairo may now be described. Not far south of Masr
                    El-’Ateekah, the mountain and desert approach very near the river on that side,
                    and soon after the wide opening of a valley is seen. Beyond it is a bold
                    promontory of the eastern range, which first gradually recedes and then becomes
                    parallel with the river for some distance, leaving but a narrow strip of
                    cultivated land. Behind the village of Turk, the ancient Troja, are the quarries
                    named after it, and a little farther to the south are those of El-Maasarah.
                    These quarries are great excavated chambers and passages, which are entered by
                    large square apertures in the steep face of the mountain. Hence were taken the
                    finer blocks of limestone employed in the construction of the Pyramids of
                    El-Geezeh. Tablets in both quarries record the quarrying executed under
                    different sovereigns. South of the quarries the character of the eastern bank
                    continues unchanged, and presents no remarkable object until we reach the
                    promontory of the Sheykh Aboo-Noor, which will be subsequently mentioned. The
                    western bank, on the contrary, is broad and fertile, abounding in villages, and
                    above its palm-groves rise in the distance the massive forms of the long series
                    of pyramids. Considerably beyond those of Dahshoor, which may be considered as
                    the most southern in the Memphite necropolis, are the two Pyramids of
                    El-Metâneeyeh, which are too small to be seen from the river, and yet farther
                    the solitary Pyramid of Meydoom, commonly called the False Pyramid. Dr Brugsch
                    thinks it very probable that it was the tomb of Senoferu, last king of Dynasty
                    III. It is a structure of great size, having a base of about 400 feet, and a
                    height of about 310 feet. Iu consequence of blocks having been pulled off its
                    sides for building purposes, it has the appearance of being built in two
                    degrees, the lower of which is much greater than the upper, while the fallen
                    stones around its base make it seem as if raised upon an eminence to increase
                    its apparent size, and hence its name. The entrance has not beeu discovered. Its
                    position, rising alone above the rich valley and desert beyond, without any
                    object by which to measure its size, render this pyramid, especially when seen
                    from some distance across a broad part of the river to the north, a very
                    striking object. There is nothing else worthy of a visit on the western bank
                    until <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n797/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0797-0774"/> we reach the town of Benee-Suweyf, about seventy
                    miles by the course of the river from Cairo.</p>
                <p>Benee-Suweyf is a busy town, being the port of the Feiyoom. A. road leads hence
                    to that province, in a north-westeιly direction. After crossing the great canal
                    called the Bahr-Yoosuf, we pass through the opening in the Libyan range which
                    leads to the Feiyoom, leaving on our right the ruined brick Pyramid of
                    El-Lâhoon, so called from an adjacent village.</p>
                <p>The Feiyoom, including its lake, is a pear-shaped tract (its narrowest part being
                    to the west), extending into the desert, and measuring in its greatest length
                    about thirty miles, and in its greatest breadth about twenty. The part now
                    cultivated is more than two-thirds of this extent from the east. At the
                    north-western extremity is the great lake of El-Karn, which is long and narrow,
                    and fills the northern portion of the valley. A branch of the Bahr-Yoosuf flows
                    through the opening leading to the Feiyoom. This canal soon spreads into many
                    streams, two of which, after joining into a single course, carry off the
                    superabundant waters of the inundation into the lake of El-Karn, while they
                    contribute with the others to irrigate the cultivable tracts.</p>
                <p>The site of the famous Labyrinth first claims our notice after entering the
                    Feiyoom. Its position may be known by a ruined crude brick pyramid, that of
                    Hawarah, which is spoken of by both Herodotus and Strabo, and may be called the
                    Pyramid of the Labyrinth. The remains of the Labyrinth itself, which had been
                    previously known, were first carefully examined by the Prussian expedition
                    headed by Professor Lepsius, in 1843. The structure was so ruined, however, that
                    the results were not as decisive as might have been hoped. Yet the plan was to
                    some extent made out, and the building shown to have contained a great number of
                    very small chambers, as ancient writers had said; and the discovery of royal
                    names of Dynasty XII., particularly of Amenemhat III, to whom Mauetho ascribes
                    the founding of the Labyrinth, leaves little doubt that this king was the Moeris
                    who built the Labyrinth, according to the classic writers. The use of this
                    building has not been distinctly ascertained. Manetho indeed makes it to have
                    been the founder’s tomb, but it is most probable that he was buried in the
                    pyramid, which, however, the Egyptian historian may have regarded as part of the
                    Labyrinth, as it is evidently connected with that structure.</p>
                <p>Not far beyond the site of the Labyrinth is the capital of the province, usually
                    called “El-Medeeneh,” or “the City,” and “Medeeuet-el-Feiyoom,” “the City” or
                    “Capital of the Feiyoom,” close to the mounds of the ancient Arsinoë, or
                    Crocodilopolis. It is a small but flourishing town. The only monuments of
                    antiquity in its neighbourhood are the remains at Beyâhmoo somewhat to the
                    north, and the great broken tablet at Begeeg, at a smaller distance to the
                    south. The former are two structures supposed by some to be pyramids, and the
                    latter, which is a record of the time of Usurtesen I., is usually called an
                    obelisk, but it must rather be regarded as a very tall and narrow stele or
                    tablet, upwards of 40 feet in height.</p>
                <p>In this part of the Feiyoom, to the north of El-Medeeneh, may be traced the
                    remains of that remarkable hydraulic work the Lake Moeris. M. Linant, a French
                    engineer, was the first to determine the position and character of this famous
                    work of antiquity; and the results of his investigations are in accordance with
                    the opinions of some who had previously noticed the subject in published works
                    <hi rend="italic">{Mémoire sur le Lac Moerisf</hi> Soc. Eg., 1843). The object
                    of the Lake Moeris was to regulate the irrigation of the I eiyoom, anciently the
                    Crocodilopolite Nome, and afterwards the Arsinoïte; and it was valuable on
                    account of its fisheries. It seems rather to have deserved the name of a very
                    large reservoir than that of a lake. Notwithstanding the drying up of the Lake
                    Moeris, the Feiyoom is still an important and fertile province. It produces very
                    large quantities of grapes; and the fields of roses, cultivated for the sake of
                    rose-water, present a remarkable appearance.</p>
                <p>The great Lake of El-Karn is perhaps the most interesting object in this part of
                    Egypt. Its name, Birket-el-Karn, signifies “The Lake of the Horn,” or
                    “Projection,” by which an island is intended, and not its general form, as has
                    been supposed, It is, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson about 35 miles long and
                    about 7 broad at its widest part and is not deep, as far as has been
                    ascertained. The watet is brackish and unwholesome, though derived from the
                    Nile, which has at all seasons a much higher level. It is bounded on the south
                    by tracts in a state of cultivation, or deserted for want of labourers, though
                    anciently cultivated, and on the north by the Libyan desert, above which rises a
                    bold range of mountains; and it has a strange and picturesque wildness. Its
                    northern shore was anciently cultivated, at least in part, but is now entirely
                    waste. Near the lake are several sites of ancient towns, and the temple called
                    Kasr-Kâroon distinguishes the most important of these. That temple, however,
                    being devoid of sculpture, and doubtless of the Roman period, could not attract
                    attention except in a region barren of monuments. After this cursory view of the
                    Feiyoom we may return to the Nile and continue our southward course.</p>
                <p>Not far south of Benee-Suweyf the eastern chain is washed by the river at the
                    picturesque promontory of the Sheykh Aboo-Noor, whose tomb stands on its summit.
                    From this point as far as the town of Manfaloot the mountains on the east are
                    close to the Nile, leaving a narrow space of cultivable land, or none at all,
                    while the western bank is far broader than before. For forty miles nothing
                    remarkable attracts the eye except the lofty mounds of ancient towns, until one
                    sees the well-proportioned minaret of a mosque in the large village of Semeloot,
                    said to have been erected by the architect of the mosque of Sultan Hasan at
                    Cairo. Not far beyond, the river washes the picturesque cliffs of Gebel-et-Teyr,
                    or the Mountain of Birds, part of the eastern range. Upon its summit stands a
                    Coptic convent, called the Convent of the Virgin, Deyr-el- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Adra. One of the monks of this convent usually climbs
                    down the steep face of the mountain by a dizzy path, and swims to the
                    traveller’s boat to solicit alms as a fellow Christian. In this part of Egypt we
                    first begin to notice the entrances of grottoes in the face of the eastern
                    mountains, but none of these for some distance are known to be of any interest.
                    Not far beyond Gebel-et-Teyr is the town of El-Minyeh, on the western bank, a
                    place wearing a cheerful aspect. Opposite El-Minyeh are quarries and sepulchral
                    grottoes, the most remarkable of the latter being at a site called
                    El-K0m-el-Ahmar, or “the Red Mound.” These are of the age of Dynasties IV. and
                    VI., but they have sustained so much damage in modern times that they do not
                    repay a visit, except from one who is a student of hieroglyphics. A governor of
                    El-Minyeh, an ignorant Turk, used these ancient tombs as quarries; and had it
                    not been for the interference of Mr Harris of Alexandria, the more important
                    grottoes of Benee-Hasan would have shared the same fate at his hands.</p>
                <p>The first noteworthy objects above El-Minyeh are the sepulchral grottoes of
                    Benee-Hasan, which are inferior to none in Egypt for beauty and interest. They
                    are excavated in the face of the eastern mountains, which are here very low and
                    sloping, and separated from the river by a small extent of debris and desert,
                    and a very narrow strip of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n798/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0798-0775"/> cultivable land. The grottoes are almost in a
                    line near the summit of the mountain, and at no great height above the river.
                    The two northernmost are remarkable for having porticoes, each supported by two
                    polygonal columns of an order which is believed to be the prototype of the
                    Doric. Most of the grottoes are adorned with sculptures and paintings, which
                    portray with eminent truthfulness and character the manners of the Egyptians of
                    the remote period at which they were executed, for they are tombs of nomarchs
                    and other governors of Dynasty XII. They generally consist of a chapel of large
                    dimensions, having sometimes a portico before it, and a niche with seated
                    figures of the chief persons buried in the tomb at the extremity, and have pits
                    leading to sepulchral chambers. The principal apartment is sometimes supported
                    by pillars cut out of the rock, and vaulted. Its walls bear representations of
                    the diversions of the occupant during his lifetime, and of his varied
                    occupations, in scenes depicting hunting, fishing, games, feasts, the processes
                    of agriculture, and the like. The figures of beasts and birds, more especially
                    the latter, are characterized by a remarkable fidelity and beauty, and there can
                    be no doubt that Egyptian art had attained a greater excellence at this time
                    than it possessed under Dynasty IV. A little to the south of these grottoes, in
                    a ravine, is the Speos Artemidos, a small rock-temple of Sekhet or Pakht, the
                    Egyptian Diana, and some sepulchres of little interest.</p>
                <p>A few miles to the south of the Speos Artemidos are two sites, one on either side
                    of the river, which were marked, in the present century, by most important
                    monuments, which have since been destroyed by the Turks. That on the western
                    side, near the large village of El-Ashmooneyn, the ancient Hermopolis Magna, was
                    part of a magnificent portico, bearing the names of Philip Aridaeus, Alexander
                    Aegus, and Ptolemy I., all that stood of the temple of Thoth; and on the
                    opposite side of the river were considerable remains of the edifices of the town
                    of Antinoöpolis founded by Hadrian. While we regret the destruction of such
                    interesting records, we must not charge either the Turks or the native Egyptians
                    with all the mischief of this kind which is perpetrated, and our sorrow is
                    increased by the reflection that to European travellers, principally Englishmen
                    and Americans, must be assigned no small share in the destruction or mutilation
                    of the monuments, which in the case of educated men is nothing less than a
                    crime.</p>
                <p>A short distance south of Antinoöpolis is the town of Mel-lawee, on the western
                    bank, and a little farther, on the other side of the river, the promontory
                    called Gebel-esh-Sheykh Sa’eed, which is honeycombed with grottoes, some of
                    which are shown by their sculptures to be very ancient, but are so ill preserved
                    as to require but a short examination. A little beyond, however, in the district
                    of Tell-El-’Amàrineh, or the Mound of El-’Amârineh, a small fertile tract where
                    the eastern mountains recede, noted, like Benee-Hasan, for the turbulent and
                    thievish propensities of its inhabitants, are most curious remains of a very
                    ancient town. It was the capital of Khu-n-aten, the sun-worshipper of Dynasty
                    XVIII,, and was no doubt destroyed by Horus, and not subsequently rebuilt. In
                    the mountain behind it are very interesting sepulchral grottoes, in which were
                    buried the courtiers of this king, and from them we obtain much information
                    respecting his religion, a very pure form of sun-worship. The representations
                    are chiefly of the king, his queen, and their children, distributing presents to
                    the soldiers and others, of acts of worship to the sun, and of the temple of the
                    sun as well as gardens and villas.</p>
                <p>On the western bank of the Nile, a little to the south of Tell-el-’Amârineh, is
                    the small town of Deroot-esh-Shereef, supposed to be on the site of the Thebaica
                    Phylace, which guarded the northern boundary of the Thebais. About 20 miles to
                    the south is the town of Manfaloot, on the same side of the river, which has a
                    decayed appearance from the manner in which the stream has encroached upon and
                    washed away part of it. Opposite to Manfaloot in the eastern range are extensive
                    crocodile-mummy catacombs. There is nothing of note during the next 25 miles of
                    the river’s course, which is very winding, until we reach the village of El-Ham
                    rà, the port of Asyoot. This town, the capital of Upper Egypt, or the Sa’eed,
                    that is, of the whole country above Cairo, lies inland, about two miles from
                    El-Hamrà, in a richly cultivated plain. Asyoot, with its beautiful mosques, two
                    of which, one of the Memlook style, and the other of the Turkish, are not
                    unworthy of comparison with those of the metropolis, and its Constantinopolitan
                    palace, surrounded on three sides by verdant fields, and having behind it a fine
                    rounded spur of the western chain, which here, for the first time, is near the
                    river, presents a picturesque aspect as the traveller approaches it. On entering
                    Asyoot he is not disappointed, for the excellence of the goods and provisions
                    sold in the well-built chief market, and the solid look of the houses, indicate
                    activity and prosperity. And it is not a little remarkable that this was an
                    important town some 4000 years ago, and has thus outlived Thebes and Memphis,
                    Tanis and Pelusium. The ancient Egyptian name was Ssut, or probably Ssiut, but
                    the Greeks called it Lycopolis, on account of the worship of the wolf-or
                    jackal-headed divinity of the place, a form of Anubis. In the mountain behind
                    Asyoot are some ancient grottoes, one of which is of great size, but their
                    sculptures have unfortunately suffered much. The view of the valley and the town
                    beneath is an ample reward for the ascent.</p>
                <p>Thirty miles farther by the river, on the eastern bank, is the village of
                    Kâw-el-Kebeereh, where was anciently Antaeopolis. The interesting remains of the
                    temple of Antaeus, which stood here early in the present century, have entirely
                    disappeared through the encroachment of the river, and also, it is believed,
                    from having been used as a quarry by the Turks. A few miles beyond, the lofty
                    part of the eastern range called the Gebel-esh-Sheykh-El-Hareedee from a famous
                    Muslim saint, hems in the river on one side for a short distance. It soon,
                    however, retires again, and the valley on that side becomes broader than usual.
                    Here, a short way from the river, stands the small town of Akhmeem, the ancient
                    Chemmis, or Panopolis. No remains of importance mark this site. About 22 miles
                    farther by the course of the river, on the western bank, is the important town
                    of Girgà, which was, until a comparatively recent period, the capital of the
                    Sa’eed. The rise of Asyoot, however, and the agency of the river which is
                    gradually washing it away, have contributed to its decline, and it wears a
                    dilapidated aspect.</p>
                <p>The city of Abydos was a few miles from Girgà, in a south-westerly direction on
                    the border of the desert, here separated from the Nile by a broad cultivated
                    tract. Close to it was Thinis or This, the town of Menes. Two interesting
                    edifices render Abydos worthy of a visit. They are both dedicated to Osiris, the
                    chief divinity of the place. The southernmost of these is a temple of Osiris, in
                    which we find the names of Ramses II. and his father Setee I. The other
                    structure is smaller, and in a worse state of preservation than the other
                    temple, and among its sculptures are the same names, those of Setee I. and
                    Ramses II. Hence was taken the famous list of Pharaohs known as the Tablet of
                    Abydos, which is now one of the most valuable objects in the British Museum, and
                    M. Mariette has since discovered a corresponding tablet in the other temple,
                    happily complete. In the desert near by are many sepulchres, remarkable on
                    account of the interesting antiquities which have been discovered by clearing
                    them out. The sanctity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n799/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0799-0776"/> of Abydos as a reputed burial-place of Osiris
                    rendered this a favourite necropolis of the ancient Egyptians from very early
                    times, particularly under Dynasty XII.</p>
                <p>At a distance of more than 40 miles from Abydos, but in nearly the same latitude,
                    is the village of Dendarah, on the left, here the southern, bank of the Nile.
                    Before reaching it we pass the small town of Farshoot at the mouth of the great
                    canal called the Bahr-Yoosuf, and the large village of Hoo, marking the site of
                    Diospolis Parva. Opposite the latter place are some sepulchral grottoes in the
                    eastern chain, called those of Kasr-es-Seiyâd, which is believed to occupy the
                    position of Chenoboscion. They contain names of kings of Dynasty VI., but the
                    representations which occupy their walls are not of unusual interest. At
                    Dendarah is the first well-preserved and unencumbered temple that is seen in a
                    voyage up the Nile, that of Athor, the Egyptian Venus, who presided over the
                    town of Tentyra, or Tentyris, the capital of the Tentyrite nome. It stands on
                    the mounds of the town about a mile and a half from the Nile. From it we gain a
                    good idea of Egyptian religious architecture under the Greek and Roman
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>The temple is surrounded by a great wall of crude brick, entered by a stone
                    portal adorned with sculptures representing the emperors Domitian and Trajan,
                    engaged in acts of worship before several divinities. The portico to which it
                    leads is about 135 feet in width, and is one of the richest and most beautiful
                    structures of the kind. It is supported by twenty-four columns, four deep,
                    nearly 50 feet in height, and having a diameter of somewhat more than 7 feet at
                    the thickest part. The capitals have a full face of Athor sculptured on each of
                    their four sides, and above these a kind of shrine. The three columns on each
                    side of the entrance are connected by an intercolumniation. The portico, like
                    the rest of the temple, is of higher merit as regards its architecture than its
                    sculpture, for the latter art had declined under the Greek and Roman rule to a
                    much greater degree than the former. The sculptures are of the same kind as on
                    the portal, representing offerings made by some of the earlier Caesars; and on
                    the ceiling are various mystical subjects, probably of an astronomical import,
                    and the famous Zodiac from which an extravagant idea of the antiquity of the
                    temple was deduced before hieroglyphics were interpreted. The greater part of
                    the back wall of the portico was the front of the temple before this portion was
                    added. This inner part consists of three considerable chambers, an isolated
                    sanctuary, and numerous small apartments. The first of these is a hall,
                    supported by a double row of columns, three on each side, of a rather heavy
                    form, for they have, beneath the capital formed of the block with the faces of
                    Athor and the shrine, another capital of a cup shape. This hall is entered by a
                    doorway in the middle of the back wall of the portico, and passing through it we
                    reach a second and third chamber of tbe same breadth but shorter, and then the
                    sanctuary. This chamber is much narrower, and is isolated by a passage running
                    round it. On each side of the chambers and passage are many small apartments,
                    two passages to the exterior, and two staircases; and there are singular
                    inclined passages in the walls, two of which are entered from the sides of the
                    portico. The whole interior is covered with sculptures and inscriptions of a
                    religious character, stating in a systematic manueτ the use of each chamber in
                    the temple-worship. The royal names have not always been filled in, the rings
                    remaining vacant; but when they have been sculptured, they are generally those
                    of the last Cleopatra, and Ptolemy Caesar, her son by Julius Caesar. On the roof
                    of the temple to which the staircases lead, there are a sort of chapel and some
                    small chambers, one of which 13 very interesting, because its sculptures relate
                    to the myth of Osiris. The exterior of the temple is as completely covered with
                    sculptures as the interior. Among the figures represented here are those of
                    Cleopatra and Ptolemy Caesar; but they cannot be supposed to convey any
                    resemblance, since they belong not alone to a conventional art, but almost to
                    its lowest period. There are two smaller temples near the great temple of Athor,
                    one of Isis, and the other of the kind called a Typhonium. Both are of the Roman
                    time. See admirable account of the temple in Mariette’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monuments of Upper Egypt,</hi> 125 <hi rend="italic">seqq.</hi></p>
                <p>On the opposite side of the Nile, a little above Dendarah, is the town of Kiuè,
                    between which and Arabia some traffic is carried on by the route through the
                    desert to El-Kuseyr on the Red Sea. The best of the porous water bottles which
                    are used throughout Egypt are manufactured here; and the great water-jars,
                    called “bellâsee,” which the women carry, are made at the large village of
                    Bellas, a few miles higher on the western bank. Opposite to Bellâs is the
                    village called Kuft or Kift, marking the site of the important town of Coptos,
                    which was the emporium on the Nile of the Arabian and Indian trade under the
                    Ptolemies; and, somewhat to the south, is the inconsiderable town of Koos, the
                    ancient Apollinopolis Parva, which succeeded to the trade of Coptos, under the
                    Muslims, until Kinè supplanted it. On the western bank, a little higher, is the
                    small town of Nakâdeh, which the people call Nagâdeh, where are Roman Catholic
                    and Coptic convents. A short distance beyond Nakâdeh are the northernmost of the
                    remains of Thebes.</p>
                <p>The monuments of Thebes do not present from afar the imposing appearance of the
                    Pyramids of Memphis. Placed for the most part at a distance from the Nile, as
                    well as from one another, and having on the western side the picturesque form of
                    a much higher mountain than any near Memphis rising behind them, they do not
                    strike those who see them from the river. Most of them are not indeed visible
                    from the Nile except when it is at its height. The stately colonnade of the
                    temple of El-Uksur, incorrectly called Luxor, on the very bank, is, however, not
                    unworthy the magnificence of Thebes, and when one approaches the other monuments
                    his utmost expectations are exceeded by the grandeur of El-Karnak, the beauty of
                    the temple of Ramses IL, and the mystery of the Tombs of the Kings. Nowhere else
                    are the mythology, the history, the very life and manners of the Egyptians of
                    old times so vividly brought before the eye as in the sculptured and inscribed
                    monuments of the capital of the Empire.</p>
                <p>Thebes, or Diospolis Magna, is called in the hieroglyphic inscriptions Ap-t, or,
                    with the article prefixed, T-ap, whence Thebes, and Nu-Amen, the city of Amen,
                    the No-Amon or No of the Bible. The date of its foundation is unknown, but there
                    are remains of the time of Dynasty XL, the first of Diospolite kings. Under the
                    sovereigns of Dynasty XII. it must have become a place of importance, but it
                    probably declined during the troubles of the Shepherd period. With Dynasty
                    XVIII. it attained its highest prosperity, and maintained it during Dynasties
                    XIX. and XX. To this period its greatest monuments belong. Then its decline
                    evidently commenced; but from the manner in which Homer mentions it <hi
                    rend="italic">(II.</hi> ix. 381-4), Thebes must have been still a great city in
                    his days. After this it suffered severely from the violence of the Assyrians and
                    Persians, and lastly of Ptolemy Lathyrus; so that in Strabo’s time the Thebans
                    inhabited villages as now, and there was no longer a city <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geogr.,</hi> xvii. 1).</p>
                <p>The monuments of Thebes, exclusive of its sepulchral grottoes, occupy a space on
                    both sides of the river, of which the extreme length from north to south is
                    about two miles, and the extreme breadth from east to west about four. The <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0800-0777"/> city was on the eastern bank, where is the great
                    temple, or rather collection of temples, called after El-Karnak, a modern
                    village near by. The temple of El-Karnak is about half a mile from the river, in
                    the cultivable land. More than a mile to the south-west is the temple of
                    El-Uksur, on the bank of the Nile. On the western bank was the suburb bearing
                    the name Memnonia. The desert near the northernmost of the temples on this side,
                    the Setheum, almost reaches the river, but soon recedes, leaving a fertile plain
                    generally more than a mile in breadth. Along the edge of the desert, besides the
                    Setheum, are the Rameseum of El-Kurneh, and, less than a mile farther to the
                    southwest, that of Medeenet-Haboo, and between them, but within the cultivated
                    land, the remains of the Amenophium with its two gigantic seated colossi. Behind
                    these edifices rises the mountain, which here attains a height of about 1200
                    feet. It gradually recedes in a south-westerly direction, and is separated from
                    the cultivated tract by a strip of desert in which are numerous tombs, partly
                    excavated in two isolated hills, and two small temples. A tortuous valley, which
                    begins not far from the Setheum, leads to those valleys in which are excavated
                    the Tombs of the Kings beneath the highest part of the mountain which towers
                    above them in bold and picturesque forms.</p>
                <p>The temple of El-Uksur is nearest of the edifices to the river, and but an
                    appendage to the great group of El-Karnak. It takes its name from the small town
                    of El-Uksur, or Abu-1-Haggâg, which is built in and around part of it, thus
                    injuring its effect, and rendering examination difficult. It differs from most
                    Egyptian temples in not facing the river, but this is accounted for by its
                    connection with the temple of El-Karnak, from the southern approaches to which a
                    long avenue of sphinxes (now wholly ruined) leads to it, ending at its entrance.
                    This is a massive propylon, or portal with wings, 200 feet in width, before
                    which is a very fine obelisk of red granite. Its fellow, which stood on the
                    western side, was removed by the French to Paris in 1831, and now adorns the
                    Place de la Concorde. Both have beautifully cut hieroglyphic inscriptions. The
                    height of that which remains is about 80 feet. It is adorned with three vertical
                    lines of hieroglyphics on each side, bearing the titles of Ramses II. The other
                    obelisk differs from this only in being slightly shorter. Close to the winged
                    portal are three seated statues of red granite representing Ramses II. · a
                    fourth has been destroyed. The wings of the portal are covered with sculptures
                    of remarkable interest, representing occurrences in the war of Ramses II. with
                    the Klιeta or Hittites, in his fifth year. On the left wing is depicted the
                    defeat by the Egyptians, led by their king, of the confederate peoples under the
                    walls of the Hittite stronghold called Ketesh, or Kadesh, on the Orontes. The
                    king is represented, according to the Egyptian custom, of a gigantic size,
                    standing in his chariot, which he has urged into the midst of the hostile force,
                    whose warriors fall by his well-directed arrows. The Egyptians, on the other
                    hand, sustain no loss. On the right wing is represented the Egyptian camp. This
                    has been sculptured over another subject, of which part may be now seen, owing
                    to the falling out of the plaster with which it had been filled. All these
                    representations are in sunk relief, and beautifully executed.</p>
                <p>The entrance to the temple is contracted by a modern wall, through the small door
                    of which we pass into a great court choked by the huts of the town, among which
                    stands a mosque. The court is surrounded by a double row of columns, the
                    capitals of which have the form of the bud of the papyrus. À ruined portal with
                    wings forms the end cf this court, and with it begins the older part of the
                    edifice, which has a more southerly direction; and its southernmost part in like
                    manner turns a little more in that direction, that is, from the river, though
                    not so remarkably. Some deviation was probably rendered necessary by the course
                    of the Nile. The second court is much obstructed by rubbish; nothing is seen of
                    it but a magnificent central avenue of fourteen columns, having capitals of the
                    bell-shaped flower of the papyrus. The columns are about 60 feet in height, of
                    fine form, and elegantly sculptured. They were raised by Amenophis III., whose
                    name is the oldest which occurs on them and in the rest of the temple. Behind
                    this is another court, which has a double row of columns on each side, and at
                    its end a portico supported by columns four deep. This court is much ruined.
                    Beyond it are several chambers of the time of Amenophis III., and in the midst
                    of them an isolated sanctuary, the sculptures of which bear the name of
                    Alexander Aegus, in whose reign it was built, in the place, no doubt, of one
                    destroyed by the Persians under Cambyses or Ochus, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson
                    remarks <hi rend="italic">(Modern Egypt and Thebes,</hi> ii. 245). Most of these
                    apartments are in a dilapidated state.</p>
                <p>Although there is an approach to the temple of El-Karnak from that of El-Uksur,
                    the grand entrance was towards the river, and from that direction it should be
                    entered. This extraordinary assemblage of buildings consists of a great temple
                    and several smaller structures, surrounded by a massive crude brick wall. There
                    are other remains similarly inclosed, which were connected with the great
                    temple.</p>
                <p>The grand entrance is through a propylon more than 360 feet wide, for this is its
                    measure above the rubbish which is piled up around it. It was never sculptured,
                    nor was its surface smoothed. It presents, therefore, a rude appearance, and is
                    much ruined, a great part of the left or northern wing having been demolished.
                    The court of which the propylon forms the front measures 329 feet in width and
                    275 in length, having on each side a gallery with a single row of columns; and a
                    double colonnade, of which one column alone stands, formed an avenue from its
                    entrance to that of the hypostyle hall beyond. On the right side a temple of
                    older date interrupts the side gallery, extending 50 feet into the court. Its
                    front is formed by a propylon, about 90 feet wide, on each wing of which Ramses
                    III. is portrayed in the act of slaying prisoners before Amen-ra. The interior
                    of this temple consists of a court, which has on each side a row of Osiridean
                    pillars, and at the end another row of such pillars with columns behind them, a
                    hall or portico supported by eight columns, next to the court, and, beyond,
                    other apartments. Nearly all the sculptures are of the reign of Ramses III., but
                    the names of later sovereigns occur. On the other side of the great court is a
                    small structure which may be called a chapel, or three chapels. The most
                    interesting sculptures in this part of the group of temples are outside the
                    eastern portion of the south wall of the great court, for here is the famous
                    list of countries and towns subdued by Sheshonk I., or Shishak, the head of
                    Dynasty XXII. Among the names is that thought to be the kingdom of Judah, and
                    those of several places in the dominions of Rehoboam and Jeroboam I. At the end
                    of the court is a fine portal, the wings of which are much ruined. This is the
                    entrance to the great hypostyle hall, the most magnificent work of its class in
                    Egypt. Its length is 170 feet, and its width 329; it is supported by 134
                    columns, the loftiest of which are nearly 70 feet in height, and about 12 in
                    diameter, and the rest more than 40 feet in height, and about 9 in diameter. The
                    great columns, 12 in number, form an avenue through the midst of the court from
                    the entrance, and the others are arranged in rows very near together on each
                    side. There is a transverse avenue made by two rows of the smaller columns being
                    placed farther apart than the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0801-0778"/> rest. This great hall is therefore crowded with
                    columns, and the effect is surprisingly grand. The spectator, being generally
                    unable to see beyond the columns which are immediately around him, perceives the
                    vast dimensions which, if viewed from a distance, might lose their effect. The
                    forest of columns seems interminable in whatever direction he looks, producing a
                    result unsurpassed in any other Egyptian temple. The partial ruin of its stone
                    roof, and of some of the columns, renders the hall the more picturesque, and
                    makes us wonder at the force which must have been expended in attempting to
                    demolish it. This grand hall was built by Setee I., Dynasty XIX., and sculptured
                    partly in his reign and partly in that of his son and successor Ramses II., who
                    has sometimes effaced his father’s name to substitute his own. It commemorates,
                    not in its grandeur alone, but also by its sculptures, the magnificence and
                    power of these two great Pharaohs. The sculptures of the interior of the walls
                    represent these kings making offerings to the gods, and the like subjects occupy
                    the columns. Far more interesting are those which adorn the exterior of the
                    walls, and record the achievements of the same kings, those of Setee I. being on
                    the north wall, and those of Ramses II. on the south. The former are of much
                    greater interest than the latter, as far as we can judge, and in this respect
                    inferior to none in Egypt. The scenes on the north wall are arranged in three
                    compartments, of which the upper one has been nearly destroyed. In these scenes
                    the king is represented of a gigantic size, charging in his chariot, and putting
                    to the rout his enemies, capturing their strongholds, and returning home in
                    triumph. The chief nations are the <hi rend="italic">Kheta</hi> or Hittites; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Paten</hi><hi rend="italic">(Leuten),</hi> at this time a
                    great nation of Syria; the <hi rend="italic">Shasu,</hi> or Arabs; the <hi
                    rend="italic">IChalu,</hi> Syria, or Syrians; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pemenen,</hi> Armenia. Among the captured places is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ketesh,</hi> in those days the most important stronghold between Egypt and
                    Mesopotamia. There is also a long list of countries, cities, and tribes,
                    conquered or ruled by the king, among which we find <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naharina,</hi> that is Aram-naharaim, or Mesopotamia, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kesh,</hi> Kush, or Ethiopia, &amp;c. The battle-scenes of Ramses II. on the
                    south wall do not, as far as they are seen, equal these in interest. Here also
                    is a list of the king’s conquests and possessions, and on the west side of a
                    wall which joins this one at right angles, forming the side of a court of the
                    southern approach to the temple, is a representation of the capture of Askelena
                    or Ascalon, and an inscription recording the treaty between Ramses II. and the
                    Kheta, concluded in the twenty-first year of his reign. The back of the
                    hypostyle hall is formed by a ruined propylon bearing the name of Amenophis
                    III., and then at a distance of about 50 feet is another propylon, entirely
                    ruined. In the space between these propyla, which was a court, stands a
                    beautiful obelisk of red granite, upwards of 70 feet high, raised by Thothmes I.
                    The fragments of its fellow, which was more to the north, strew the ground.
                    Behind the second of these propyla is another granite obelisk, 108 feet high,
                    and according to M. Mariette the loftiest known <hi rend="italic">(Monuments of
                    Upper Egypt,</hi> 170). This great obelisk of El-Karnak is a monument of Queen
                    Hatshepu of Dynasty XVIII., and an inscription on its pedestal records the
                    period which elapsed (nineteen months) from the time that it was begun to be cut
                    in the quarry until its completion in the queen’s sixteenth year. The fellow of
                    the great obelisk, which stood to the south of it, has been broken, and its
                    fragments occupy its place. Beyond the great obelisk is the chief sanctuary, a
                    structure almost entirely of granite, divided into two apartments, which was
                    built under Philip Aridaeus, in the place, no doubt, of one destroyed by
                    Cambyses or Ochus. The space between the hypostyle hall and this sanctuary is
                    extremely ruined, the huge stones being piled up in heaps as though au
                    earthquake had overthrown the temple. But this destruction was probably due to
                    human violence. Behind the sanctuary are fragments of a very ancient part of the
                    temple, bearing the name of Usurtesen I., Dynasty XII. Considerably farther is a
                    large oblate building of the time of Thothmes III., which affords a remarkable
                    example of architectural caprice, its columns having inverted shafts and
                    capitals, and its cornices being likewise inverted. Behind this and a stone wall
                    of inclosure are ruined chambers, and far beyond, directly behind the centre of
                    the great temple, in the crude brick wall of inclosure, is a handsome portal,
                    never finished, bearing the name of Nectanebes II.</p>
                <p>The southern approach to the temple of El-Karnak from that of El-Uksur is, as
                    before mentioned, by a ruined avenue of sphinxes, which ends near the great
                    structure, and two other avenues begin. The westernmost of these, which is of
                    colossal rams, conducts to a temple situate not far to the south-west of the
                    first court of the great temple: we approach it through a stately portal bearing
                    in its inscriptions the name of Ptolemy Euergetes I. The front of the temple,
                    before which was another avenue of rams, is a propylon, which is almost
                    uninjured. Behind it is a court having a double row of columns on each side and
                    at the end, and again behind this is a hall supported by eight columns, and many
                    small chambers. This temple was dedicated to Khuns, the third member of the
                    Theban triad. It was begun under Dynasty XX., and continued by the high-priest
                    kings. A small edifice having sculptures of the time of the Greek and Roman rule
                    stands on the west of the court of this temple.</p>
                <p>The avenue of sphinxes which branches off at the same place as the avenue of rams
                    leading to the temple of Khuns takes an easterly direction and ends where
                    another begins at right angles to it, which connects the southern courts leading
                    to the great temple with a separate inclosure. The latter contains a lake which
                    has the shape of a horseshoe, and the remains of the temple of Mut. At the
                    northern extremity of the avenue, which is of criosphinxes, is a propylon
                    forming the front of a large court ending in a second propylon, which, like the
                    other, is much ruiued. Beyond this, but not in exactly the same direction, after
                    a vacant space, the approach continues through two smaller propyla, the second
                    of which is nearly destroyed. Each fronts a court, and at the end of the
                    secondof these courts was the great side entrance to the temple. The first and
                    second propyla were, like the criosphinxes, monuments of King Har-em-heb, or
                    Horus, of Dynasty XVIIL,and were partly built of materials of a temple or palace
                    of the sun-worshipping kings whom he overthreλv. The third propylon is more
                    ancient, for it bears the name of Thothmes III. and Amenophis IL, as well as of
                    subsequent kings; the age of the fourth is not certain; the name of Ramses II.
                    occurs here, but it may have been founded before his time. There is an inclosure
                    in the angle formed eastward by the third and fourth propyla with the great
                    temple, which contains a sacred lake.</p>
                <p>Adjoining the great crude-brick wall of inclosure at its north-eastern portion is
                    another containing the ruins of an important temple. The chief approach is
                    through a stately portal of the Ptolemaic period, in the crude-brick wall. The
                    temple to which it conducted was very beautifιd and costly, as we can judge from
                    its remains, which show with how much violence it was destroyed. It seems to
                    have been founded under Dynasty XVIII. There are two small temples or chapels,
                    one of the time of Achoris and the other of that of Nectanebes I. and IL, in the
                    same inclosure. Another crude-brick inclosure of small dimensions, near the
                    south-east corner of that of the great temple, contains some unimportant remains
                    of a small edifice.</p>
                <p>This brief description will convey some idea of the magnitude of the temple of
                    Amen-ra at Thebes, with its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0802-0779"/> appendages; but no one who has not seen that
                    wonder- ∣ ful assemblage of ruins can picture to himself the massiveness of its
                    castle-like propyla, the grandeur of its hall of columns, the beauty of its
                    great obelisk, and the sublimity of its heaped-up ruins. Of the city of Thebes
                    there are scarcely any remains. Doubtless its edifices were of perishable
                    materials.</p>
                <p>Beginning our examination of the monuments of the western bank, where was the
                    great suburb of the Memnonia, from the northward, the first object of interest
                    is the Setheum, a small temple of Setee I., which the natives call
                    Kasr-Er-Rubeyk, at the ruined village of El-Kurneh. A portico, originally
                    supported by ten columns, of which two have fallen, extends along the whole
                    front of the building. Three entrances lead to the interior of the temple: the
                    middle one of these is the door of a hall having twelve columns. From this
                    apartment we pass into several small chambers, which are of little interest,
                    like the ruined chambers which we enter from the northern door. The southern
                    door is the entrance of a separate part of the edifice, which contains a small
                    hall supported by two columns, and three chambers behind it, the middle one of
                    which was a sanctuary or chapel, devoted, as its sculptures show, to the worship
                    of Ramses I., the father of Setee I. The inscriptions of the temple tell us that
                    it was dedicated to Amen-ra by its founder Setee I., and continued by his son
                    Ramses IL, and his grandson Menptah. It was the funereal chapel of the tombs of
                    Ramses I. and Setee I.</p>
                <p>The great temple of Ramses II, which may be called the Rameseum of El-Kurneh, but
                    is commonly though incorrectly known as the Memnonium, is situate at a distance
                    of about a mile to the westward of the Setheum, and is like it on the edge of
                    the desert, which here is much farther from the Nile. Notwithstanding that its
                    condition is much more ruined than that of other edifices of Thebes, the
                    beautiful architecture of what remains, and the historical interest of its
                    spirited sculptures, render it altogether second alone in its attractions to the
                    great pile of El-Karnak. A propylon, 225 feet in width, of which a great part
                    has been thrown down, forms the front of the edifice. Through its portal we
                    enter a spacious court 180 feet wide and 142 long. It had originally a double
                    colonnade on either side, every column of which has been destroyed, while the
                    side walls have been entirely demolished and the end wall partially. On the back
                    of the propylon are sculptured a battle and other scenes of a campaign in the
                    king’s eighth year. In this court is one of the most wonderful objects at
                    Thebes, a colossal statue of Ramses II., broken in pieces, exceeding in its
                    weight and equalling in its dimensions any other known Egyptian statue. It was
                    of a single block of red granite, and must have been transported hither from the
                    quarries of Syene, notwithstanding that its weight was, according to Sir Gardner
                    Wilkinson’s computation, about 887 tons, 5∣ cwt. <hi rend="italic">(Modern Egypt
                    and Thebes,</hi> ii. 144, 145). It was 60 feet in height, representing the king
                    seated on his throne, and was placed on the left side of the entrance to the
                    second court. Of that court, happily, there are more remains than of the first.
                    Its width was about 170 feet and its length about 140, so that it was not much
                    smaller than the other court. It had a double colonnade m each side and at the
                    end, and but a single colonnade at the front. These were of columns having
                    capitals of the form of the papyrus bud, except eight of the ten forming the
                    front row, that is, all of that colonnade but the two extreme columns, and, in
                    like manner, the corresponding ones of the opposite row, which were Osiridean
                    pillars, formed of a square block, having in front a figure of Ramses as Osiris.
                    Many of the columns and pillars have been demolished; but those which yet stand
                    enable us to judge how magnificent this part of the temple must have been. On
                    what remains of the front wall of the couft, that is, on its northern half, are
                    very remarkable sculptures. Here is a great scene representing a battle between
                    the Egyptians, led by Ramses IL, and the Kheta or Hittites, near the strong city
                    of Ketesh. The king of Egypt is portrayed routing the chariots of the enemy, who
                    flee in disorder towards Ketesh <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> across a double
                    moat, beyond which and beneath the city a strong force of regular infantry
                    endeavours to protect their retreat. This was doubtless the decisive action of
                    the campaign against the confederates, which must be regarded as the most
                    important of the wars which distinguished the reign of Ramses IL Higher up on
                    the same wall is a procession of priests bearing small statues of kings, the
                    first of which is that of Menes, the earliest sovereign of Egypt, the second of
                    a Munt-hotp, of Dynasty XT., and the subsequent ones of the kings of Dynasties
                    XVIII. and XIX., as far as Ramses IL, with whom the series ends.</p>
                <p>Next to the second court is a hypostyle hall, which is the most admirable part of
                    the temple. It measures 100 feet in length and 133 in breadth, and originally
                    contained forty-eight columns in eight longitudinal rows, each consisting of six
                    columns. A central avenue is formed by twelve lofty columns, about 36 feet high,
                    which have capitals of the shape of the papyrus flower; while the columns on
                    each side, about 24 feet high, have capitals of the shape of the bud of the same
                    flower. The elegance of the form and the justness of the proportions of all
                    these columns is not equalled in any other Egyptian temple, and render this hall
                    one of the most beautiful structures of its kind.· Happily, although much
                    injured, it has suffered less from violence than the first and second courts. On
                    its front wall, to the left as one enters, are curious sculptures, representing
                    the rout of a hostile force, and the capture of a town, the walls of which the
                    Egyptians ascend by means of scaling ladders: Ramses II. and six of his sons
                    lead the army. On the end wall are religious subjects, and a series of the sons
                    and daughters of Ramses IL, whose legitimate offspring they seem to have been,
                    twenty-six in number, twenty-three sons and three daughters. At the temple of
                    Wadee-es-Suboo’a, in Nubia, a much larger number of children of this king were
                    represented.</p>
                <p>Beyond the hypostyle hall are two smaller chambers, the first of which is entered
                    by a doorway in the middle of the end wall of the hall. It is supported by eight
                    columns, and has on its walls representations of mythological subjects. It is
                    chiefly remarkable, however, for its astronomical ceiling, one of the most
                    precious records of ancient Egyptian science. Behind this is a ruined chamber,
                    which seems to have been of the same dimensions. The other apartments which must
                    have adjoined these are entirely demolished. This temple was the chapel of the
                    king’s tomb. The description which Diodorus Siculus gives from Hecataeus of
                    Abdera of the Tomb of Osymandyas agrees best with the Rameseum of El-Kurneh; and
                    the mention of the sacred library is in accordance with the character of the
                    sculptures of the first chamber beyond the hypostyle hall, as well a3 with the
                    statement in several papyri that they were written by the scribes in this
                    temple, in which, or attached to which, was a kind of college (Lepsius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronologie</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeggpter,</hi> i. 39, 53).</p>
                <p>To the south-west of the Rameseum of El-Kurneh, at a distance of less than half a
                    mile, a mound just within tho cultivable plain marks the site of a magnificent
                    temple of Amenophis III., which may be called the Amenophium, and which, there
                    is reason to believe, was destroyed by Cambyses. Of the obelisks and colossi
                    which stood on either side of the approach of the Amenophium, all are thrown
                    down except the two gigantic statues, one of which is known as the Vocal Memnon.
                    The latter indeed, was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0803-0780"/> broken, but afterwards restored. These colossi
                    stand about a quarter of a mile to the south-east of the mound where are the
                    scanty remains of the temple. They are of hard gritstone, monolithic, and about
                    47 feet in height, with pedestals about 12 feet high. They represent Amenophis
                    III. seated on his throne. Smaller tlιough colossal standing statues of the
                    king’s mother, Queen Mut-em-wa, and of his wife, Queen Tai, rest against the
                    space between the sides of the throne and the legs of the great statues, one at
                    either extremity; while there are remains of two other statues of Queen Tai, of
                    smaller size, standing between the feet of each colossus. The colossi are a
                    little less than GO feet apart, a distance judiciously chosen, so that they
                    should neither seem smaller than they actually are, by being placed too far from
                    each other, nor should be so near as to appear but a double statue.</p>
                <p>The Vocal Memnon is the more northern of the two statues. It was broken in the
                    midst either by the barbarism of Cambyses, or by an earthquake, more probably
                    the former (comp. Paus. A⅛te. i. 42), but long afterwards repaired. It presents
                    in consequence a very shattered appearance, and the other colossus gives us a
                    better idea of what the pair must anciently have been. Many Greek and Latin
                    inscriptions on the Vocal Statue record the visits of those who were with
                    Hadrian, and of others, and relate that they heard the voice of Memnon. There is
                    thus satisfactory evidence to show that some sound was frequently heard here at
                    sunrise; and the only dispute is whether it was produced by a physical cause, or
                    was an imposture of the priests. That it was a natural occurrence does not seem
                    impossible from the examples we have of sounds resembling that which is
                    described as having been heard here by the ancients.</p>
                <p>Less than half a mile from the mound of the Amenophium, in a south-westerly
                    direction, within the desert, is the group of temples known as those of
                    Medeenet-Haboo. This name is that applied by the Arabs to a town, which appears
                    to be that called Papa in the Roman times. The ruins of its houses obstruct the
                    temples, more especially the larger of the two. The smaller temple is nearer to
                    the river, to the eastward of the other. We first enter a ruined court, which
                    was never completed, and which had a colonnade of which two columns alone yet
                    stand, at its end, a little before the first propylon of the temple, which bears
                    the names of Ptolemy Lathyrus and Auletes among the sculptures of its gateway.
                    Beyond this is a court which had a colonnade on each side, and a propylon, much
                    smaller than the other at the end. Most of its columns have fallen, and the
                    propylon has also suffered much. On the latter we see the names of Tahraka, or
                    Tirhakah the Ethiopian, and later sovereigns. Beyond this is another court, and
                    then the chambers of the temple. The chief of these is an isolated sanctuary,
                    with a gallery around it having square pillars and fluted columns like those of
                    certain of the tombs at Benee-Hasan. The sanctuary is ornamented with sculptures
                    of sovereigns of Dynasty XVIII., including Queen Hatshepu.</p>
                <p>To the south of this temple is a very remarkable structure, which differs from
                    any other ancient monument in Egypt. It is supposed to have been a palace.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The size and character of the
                    only chambers in the temples which could have been used for habitation render it
                    most improbable that any but priests and scribes resided in them; and it is most
                    likely that the royal abodes were usually extensive pavilions constructed of no
                    stronger materials than the houses of the people, and this view the
                    representations of the tombs seem to support. The temples, however, were called
                    palaces</p></note> After passing between what seem to have been lodges, we
                    arrive at the main part of the edifice. This consists of two towers on each side
                    of a court, ending in another tower, beneath which is a gateway conducting to
                    the great temple. On the front of each of the two towers first mentioned Ramses
                    III. is represented slaying his enemies before Amen-ra, and below is a series of
                    captured chiefs. The inscriptions that remain tell us that these are the chiefs
                    of the Kheta, or Hittites, the Amari, or Amorites, the Takkaru, or Teucrians,
                    the Shardana of the sea, or Sardones, the Tuirsha of the sea, or Etruscans, and
                    of other peoples. On the walls of the chambers are curious sculptures usually
                    supposed to represent the private life of Ramses III., but probably of a
                    mythological import. Among these the king is portrayed playing at a game like
                    that of draughts with a goddess, while another stands by him.</p>
                <p>The great temple of Medeenet-Haboo is directly behind the palace through which
                    was, as already mentioned, the approach to it, and is a monument of the same
                    king, Ramses IΓT., a sovereign inferior alone as a conqueror to Ramses IL, the
                    greatest ruler of Egypt. Both the magnificence of its architecture, and the high
                    interest of its sculptures, render it one of the most interesting edifices at
                    Thebes.</p>
                <p>The first propylon cannot be less than 200 feet wide. It is partly destroyed, and
                    much of it is hidden by the remains of the town. Ou its wings the king is
                    represented slaying prisoners before the gods, and acts of worship are also
                    depicted. The court, of which this propylon is the front, is about 110 feet in
                    length and 135 in breadth, and has a colonnade on either side, forming a
                    gallery. The gallery on the right side consists of seven Osiridean pillars, that
                    on the left of eight columns having capitals of the form of the papyrus-flower,
                    affording a remarkable example of the irregularity of Egyptian architecture. At
                    its end is a second propylon, on the left wing of which Ramses III. is
                    represented bringing captives of the Takkaru, or Teucrians, before Amen-ra.
                    Passing through the granite portal of this propylon we enter the second or
                    peristyle court, the finest part of the temple. This court measures about 123
                    feet in length, and about 133 or somewhat more in w idth, thus exceeding in size
                    the first court, contrary to the usual practice of ancient Egyptian architects.
                    It has a single colonnade at the front and on either side, and a double one at
                    the end. The colonnade at the front and that facing it are each of eight
                    Osiridean pillars, while that behind the latter is of columns with capitals of
                    the papyrus-bud, and the side colonnades consist each of five similar columns,
                    one of which, on the left side, has fallen. The Christian inhabitants of the
                    town, the ruins of whose church are seen in the court, defaced many of the
                    sculptures, and particularly the Osiridean pillars; nevertheless the general
                    effect is not lost, and one is struck by a simple grandeur, which is unsurpassed
                    in any similar Egyptian structure. The sculptures of the walls are of especial
                    interest. On the back of the left wing of the propylon a series of sculptures
                    relating to the wars of Ramses III. begins and extends along the wall on the
                    left side of the court. The rout of the Rebu or Lebu, the Libyans, is depicted,
                    the triumphal return of the king, the bringing of prisoners before him on the
                    field of battle, and the like; and besides these are subjects portraying
                    ceremonies. On the right side-wall is a curious representation of the
                    celebration of the Panegyry of Amen-ra Ka-mut-f, which, from the detail in which
                    it is given, affords us considerable insight into the manner in which such
                    solemnities were kept <hi rend="italic">(Λnc. Ey.,</hi> iv. pl. 76). On the end
                    wall, and on part of each side wall, are depicted the many children of Ramses
                    III. A door in the end wall conducts to the inner part of the temple, which
                    occupies but little less space than the two courts just described. It is in a
                    very ruined condition.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0804-0781"/>
                <p>The sculptures of the exterior of this edιfi e next claim our attention, none of
                    which have been mentioned except those which occupy the face of the first
                    propylon. On the north-eastern wall is a remarkably interesting series of scenes
                    in the wars of Ramses III., equalling in the importance of their subjects and
                    the boldness with which they are executed any other records of the kind in
                    Egypt. In the first representation, which is to the extreme right, we sec Ramses
                    III. going to war; in the second is depicted the rout of the Tamhu, a Libyan
                    people; and in the third, prisoners of the Tamhu and Mashuasha, also Libyans,
                    are brought before the king, while scribes count the hands, &amp;c., which have
                    been cut from the slain, showing their number to have been 12,535. Then weapons
                    are counted for distribution to the troops. Then we see troops setting forth.
                    The next scene is a great battle with the Takkaru or Teucrians, whose army is
                    defeated by the Egyptians. The Takkaru fight in chariots of two horses and in
                    waggons drawn by four oxen. Mercenaries or allies of the Shardana, Sardoues,
                    fight in the army of Egypt. The scene which follows this is one of the most
                    spirited of Egyptian sculptures, and if compared with similar Assyrian reliefs,
                    shows the great superiority of the best Egyptian art over that of Assyria. The
                    king, who is passing through a marshy country in his chariot, encounters three
                    lions, and having smitten two of them with his javelins, turns round to meet the
                    third which is about to spring. The next subject, the most remarkable of the
                    series, represents the sea-fight, in which the Egyptian fleet defeated that of
                    the Shardana and the Takkaru, while Ramses and his army fought them from the
                    shore. Ramses then receives the praises of his warriors, and the hands of the
                    slain are brought before him and numbered. Next he leads prisoners, who are of
                    the Takkaru and Rebu, before the gods of Thebes. The other battle-scenes of the
                    series represent the capture of strong places, the carrying away of captives,
                    &amp;c. On the end wall the king is portrayed setting forth on an expedition,
                    and on the other side w all, the south-west, is a long calendar, which appears
                    to occupy the whole wall. This temple was no doubt connected in purpose with the
                    royal tomb. Not far from the Rameseum, to the southward, is a small Ptolemaic
                    temple containing three chambers. Farther in the same direction is a great lake.
                    More than half a mile in a south-westerly direction from the lake is another
                    small temple of Roman times, having an isolated sanctuary and other
                    chambers.</p>
                <p>The private and royal tombs must now be briefly noticed, but from their great
                    number, and the variety of the paintings which occupy their walls, it will not
                    be possible to give as detailed an account of them as has been given of the
                    other monuments. Two temples which are situate in the necropolis likewise
                    require a notice. The tombs, as before mentioned, occupy some of the space at
                    the foot of the mountains, or are excavated in their sides towards the valley,
                    and in two isolated hills, except the Tombs of the Kings, which are cut in the
                    sides of two ser* <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ιded valleys to the
                    westward.</p>
                <p>Beginning from the north, we first see the entrances of grottoes in the low spur
                    of the Libyan chain behind the Setheum. Several of these have a series of square
                    apertures, leaving pillars to support the roof, so as to form a kind of portico,
                    behind which is a chamber or chambers, having pits, from which open other
                    chambers for sepulture. Some grottoes here, and others extending towards the
                    Rameseum, are inhabited by the people of El-Kurneh, whose village is ruined. At
                    the foot of the mountains, as well as on their least steep sides, here and
                    throughout the necropolis, are the entrances of many mummy-pits. On the spur
                    above mentioned are brick pyramids, for the most part nearly destroyed; and in
                    the wide tract beyond, the Asaseef, where tne mountains recede, are very
                    remarkable sepulchres of die time of Dynasty XXVI. These are extensive
                    excavations, profusely sculptured almost entirely with hieroglyphics, having
                    before their entrances open courts hewn in the rock, and entered through
                    crude-brick propyla, from which walls of inclosure of the same material extend
                    around the courts. The largest of these, and indeed of all those known at
                    Thebes, is the tomb of Pet-amen-apt, a priest whose date is not fixed, but who
                    probably lived after the fall of the Ramessides. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says that
                    “the area of the actual excavation is 22,217 square feet, and with the chambers
                    of the pits 23,809, though, from the nature of its plan, the ground it occupies
                    is nearly one acre and a quarter” <hi rend="italic">{Modern Egypt and
                    Thebes,</hi> ii. 222). Almost all the passages and chambers are covered with
                    hieroglyphic inscriptions on a small scale, aud the few sculptures are of a
                    religious character. At the end of the Asaseef is a temple which was approached
                    by a very long avenue of sphinxes now entirely demolished. The temple is at the
                    base of a steep cliff, and is partly excavated in the rock, and partly built of
                    masonry. The built portion is almost wholly destroyed. A portal of red granite
                    which formed its entrance yet remains, bearing the name of Thothmes III., cut
                    over the erased name of Queen Hatshepu. A second granite portal stands behind
                    this, almost close to the rock. At some distance to the left of this are two
                    small chambers, one of which is remarkable for the form of its roof, which is
                    vaulted by horizontal stones, of which the two uppermost meet in the centre, all
                    being cut internally, so as to form an arch. The excavated part of the temple
                    consists of an oblong chamber of moderate dimensions, another of smaller size
                    with a cell on each side, and at the end a sanctuary. All these, except the
                    sanctuary, are of the time of Queen Hatshepu and Thothmes HI., and have vaulted
                    roofs. The sanctuary bears Ptolemaic sculptures, affording a remarkable contrast
                    to the delicate style of those of the chambers which lead to it, and it is
                    flat-roofed. This temple was probably sepulchral.</p>
                <p>The isolated hill of the Sheykh’Abd-El-Kurneh (probably a mistake for
                    ’Äbid-El-Kurneh, meaning “the Devotee of El-Kurneh ”), presents a singular
                    appearance from the plain, as on that side it is honeycombed by the entrances of
                    tombs. Several of these, like some of those first mentioned, have porticoes
                    before them hewn in the rock, and many have very interesting paintings,
                    representing scenes of domestic life, funeral ceremonies, arts, trades, &amp;c.,
                    in their chapel or chapels. These have unfortunately suffered greatly from the
                    disgraceful Vandalism of European travellers, and the cupidity of the natives
                    which they have encouraged. Farther towards Medeenet-Haboo is a similar isolated
                    hill, called Kurnet-Mara’ee, which contains a fewgrottoes of the same
                    description, and in the valley between this and the main mass of mountain are
                    many other interesting grottoes. At one extremity of this valley, at some
                    distance behind the Rameseum, is a small edifice with a high inclosure of
                    crude-brick walls. It is a temple of Athor, of the Ptolemaic period, and has a
                    small portico and three chambers, in one of which, the side chamber to the left,
                    is a curious sculpture, of which the subject is the judgment of a soul by
                    Osiris. Hence we may infer that this was a temple attached to the necropolis.
                    Beyond the other extremity of this valley is the secluded valley called that of
                    the Tombs of the Queens, from its containing the sepulchres of queens and
                    princesses of Dynasties XVIII., XIX., and XX. These are similar to the Tombs of
                    the Kings, but are not large, nor are the subjects on their walls, which seem
                    generally of little interest, well preserved.</p>
                <p>A long and winding valley, the entrance to λvhich is an <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0805-0782"/> opening in the mountains behind the Setheum,
                    leads to two other valleys, that of the Tombs of the Kings, and the Western
                    Valley. Both these contain royal sepulchres, but those of the former are the
                    more important. The sepulchres in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings are
                    twenty-five in number. Nineteen are the mausolea of kings, of a queen with her
                    consort, and of a prince, all of Dynasties XIX. and XX. One tomb is without
                    sculpture, and there is likewise an unsculptured passage running for a
                    considerable distance into the mountain, which may be regarded as an uncompleted
                    tomb. M. Mariette has found the tombs of functionaries in this valley <hi
                    rend="italic">{Mon.,</hi> 234). Their plan is always the same in its main
                    particulars, but they differ greatly in extent, in consequence of having been
                    begun at a king’s accession, or even before (for one of them is the tomb of an
                    heir-apparent), and continued throughout his reign, like the pyramids of
                    Memphis. Their paintings and painted sculptures likewise do not present
                    remarkable varieties, for they are almost wholly of a religious character, and
                    principally refer to the future state. These subjects are taken from the Book of
                    the Lower Hemisphere, treating of the course of the sun in the twelve hours of
                    the night, and so in the nether world. They are interesting for the manner in
                    which they illustrate the Egyptian religion, and for the beauty of their
                    execution; but their intricate nature forbids any detailed description of them
                    in the present article. The plan of one of the most interesting sepulchres may,
                    however, be described. The tomb of Setee I., commonly called Belzoni’s, since
                    that explorer first opened it since ancient times, is in the freshest state of
                    preservation, except in its outer part, although the miserable barbarism of
                    modern travellers is yearly lessening its beauty. We enter by a staircase, and
                    pass along a steep passage, which ends in a deep pit, now filled up. Thus far
                    the subjects and inscriptions which occupy the walls are unfinished, showing
                    that the tomb was not completed. Immediately beyond the pit, the part discovered
                    by Belzoni begins with a hall 26 feet by 27, supported by four square pillars,
                    the walls of which are covered with very beautiful painted sculptures, including
                    the celebrated procession of the four races. To the right of this is another
                    chamber, supported by two columns, the decorations of which were never begun,
                    having only been drawn in outline. From the left side of the former chamber we
                    descend a flight of steps, which leads to a passage, another flight of steps,
                    and then another passage, ending in a chamber 17 feet by 14, from which we pass
                    into a hall 27 feet square, having six square pillars, and on either side a
                    small chamber. This forms the portico of the great sepulchral hall, the most
                    splendid part of the tomb, which is of an oblong form, 19 feet in length and 30
                    in breadth, with an arched roof. In the midst, in a depression, was a splendid
                    sarcophagus of alabaster, now in the Soane Museum, and on its removal blocks of
                    stone were found filling up the entrance of an inclined descent, which was
                    cleared for 300 feet by Belzoni, without its termination being discovered. It is
                    not impossible that the king was buried in a chamber at the end of this passage.
                    The great sepulchral hall is covered with beautiful painted sculptures, and on
                    its ceiling are astronomical or astrological representations, resembling the
                    astronomical ceiling of the Rameseum of El-Kurneh. A door in the left side of
                    the sepulchral hall leads to a chamber which has two square pillars, and on the
                    same side is a cell; there is another chamber on the opposite side. A large
                    apartment, which was left unfinished, is behind that in which was the
                    sarcophagus, and is the last of those contained in the tomb, if the inclined
                    descent does not lead to other unknown ones. From the entrance to the end of
                    this chamber is a distance of about 300 feet.</p>
                <p>The tomb of Ramses III. is among the most splendid of the royal sepulchres. Its
                    length a little exceeds 400 feet, but from the nature of the rock its sculptures
                    are less delicately executed than those of the tomb of Setee I. In cells on
                    either side of its passage, a little within the entrance, are interesting
                    paintings illustrating manners and customs, in one of which is the celebrated
                    representation of the harpers.</p>
                <p>The tombs which have been found in the Western Valley are only four in number,
                    and but two of these contain paintings, those of Amenophis III. and of King Aï,
                    the sun-worshipper who succeeded Khu-n-aten. The former is decorated with
                    paintings in a very good style, but unfortunately they have sustained much
                    damage; the latter is historically interesting as a record of an obscure king,
                    but its paintings are of poor execution.</p>
                <p>Nowhere, perhaps, are we so forcibly struck by the feeling of the ancient
                    Egyptians with respect to death and the future state as in the Valley of the
                    Tombs of the Kings, and in the sepulchres themselves. The desolateness of the
                    spot, apart from all signs and sounds of life, fitted it for the solemn use to
                    which it was assigned; and those long dark passages, and lofty chambers, on
                    -whose walls we see the awful punishments of the wicked and the rewards of the
                    good,.fitly unveil the most secret mysteries of the Egyptian religion.</p>
                <p>Not far south of Thebes, on the western bank, is the large village of Arment, the
                    old Hermonthis, where stands a picturesque temple built by Cleopatra. It has two
                    courts with colonnades, and three chambers around which was also a colonnade, of
                    which but one column now stands. It is of small dimensions, having been the
                    “Typhonium” attached to the great temple of Mentu, the divinity of the place,
                    which has been razed. On the other bank of the river, a little higher, at Tôd,
                    anciently Tuphium, is a small Ptolemaic temple. Not far beyond, and about 20
                    miles above Thebes, by the course of the stream, are the “Gebeleyn,” or “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> Mountains,” on the western side of the river, where
                    the sandstone begins. The town of Isnè, the ancient Sne, called by the Greeks
                    Latopolis, is likewise situate on the western bank, about twelve miles higher,
                    and is remarkable as containing a very fine Egyptian monument, the portico of
                    its great temple of Kneph. This is in the heart of the modern town, and was much
                    choked with rubbish until cleared by Mehemet Ali. It is supported by twenty-four
                    lofty and massive columns, six in front, and four deep, having capitals of
                    various forms, of which those alone in corresponding positions on opposite sides
                    are of the same description, a deviation from regularity of which we do not see
                    examples previous to the Greek rule. The columns and walls are covered with
                    minute sculptures of the bad style of the period when the portico was erected.
                    —that of the Caesars. It contains the hieroglyphic names of Claudius, Vespasian,
                    Titus, and other emperors as late as Severus. The back is, however, more
                    ancient, for it bears the name of Ptolemy Philometer, being the front of the
                    older temple of which nothing more is known for certain to remain. Upon the
                    ceiling is a zodiac, from which this monument was supposed to have been of very
                    great antiquity before the interpretation of hieroglyphics had been discovered.
                    On the other bank of the Nile, on the site of Contra Latopolis, is a small
                    temple of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.</p>
                <p>A few miles above Isnè, where both the Libyan and Arabian chains approach the
                    river, are the curious remains of Eilethyia (so written in Egyptian geography).
                    There is a small temple of the Ptolemaic time, and two little sacred edifices of
                    the period of the Pharaohs, but the most interesting monuments are the tombs and
                    the fort. The former, which are excavated in a hill, are very remarkable<pb

                    husbandry, &amp;c.; and in one of them is the very curious inscription of its
                    occupant Aahmes, chief of the mariners, recording his services to early kings of
                    Dynasty XVIII. The fort is a large inclosure of crude-brick,<note

                    as the Shepherd war, for it is mentioned as the “Fort of Suben,” that is of
                    Eileithyia, in a part of the inscription above mentioned, relating to the time
                    of that war. The goddeu of the place was Suben or Lucina (Eileithyia), who was
                    especially regarded as the protector of Upper Egypt.</p>
                <p>Having proceeded about twelve miles to the southward we reach the large village
                    of Adfoo or Edfu, which represents the town called by the Greeks Apollinopolis
                    Magna, the great temple of which yet stands in a comparatively perfect state,
                    and is one of the most stately monuments of ancient Egypt, although of a time at
                    which art had greatly declined. It was dedicated to Har-hut, the god of the
                    place, whom the Greeks called Agathodaemon. Mounds of rubbish around it, as well
                    as the huts of the village, injured its effect, until it was lately cleared by
                    M. Mariette.</p>
                <p>The great propylou which forms the front of the temple measures about 226 feet in
                    width, and is, like the rest of the edifice, in a good state of preservation.
                    The sculptures upon its face represent acts of worship by Ptolemy Auletes, who
                    is portrayed slaying prisoners.</p>
                <p>The portal between the wings of this propylon is the entrance to the temple, of
                    which the first part is a great court about 161 feet long and 140 broad, with a
                    colonnade along its front and each side, of columns with various capitals
                    supporting covered galleries. At the end is a portico having eighteen columns,
                    six in front and three deep, about 82 feet broad and 46 long, measured within,
                    beyond which are a hall and passages and other chambers, the most important of
                    which is an isolated sanctuary. The wall of the great court is continued so as
                    to inclose the further portion of the temple, leaving a passage around it. The
                    sculptures show that it was begun by Ptolemy Philopator and completed at the end
                    of the Greek monarchy, though an insignificant additional subject was added by
                    Claudius. Not far from the great temple is a smaller one of the sort called
                    Typhonia, containing two chambers, around which runs a gallery supported by
                    Typhonian columns.</p>
                <p>About twenty-three miles above Adfoo the mountains on either side, which had for
                    some distance confined the valley to a narrow space, reach the river and
                    contract its course. They are low, but steep and picturesque, and in their
                    western side are seen the entrances of excavations. They are called
                    Gebel-es-Silsileh, a name derived from the earlier Silsilis. The most
                    interesting of the excavations is a rocktemple in which is portrayed the defeat
                    of a negro nation by King Har-em-heb, or Horus, of Dynasty XVIII.; here, also,
                    are subjects depicting acts of worship paid to Nilus and Sebek. To the southward
                    of this, and also facing the river, are the entrances of several excavated
                    tombs, the representations in which are not of a remarka⅛le character. Beyond
                    these are three chapels of the time of Dynasty XIX. On the opposite side are
                    very important quarries, where much of the materials of the great temples was
                    cut, especially under the Eighteenth and subsequent Dynasties.</p>
                <p>Beyond Gebel-es-Silsileh, although the mountains recede, the tract of cultivated
                    land is extremely narrow, and sometimes the desert touches the river: this is
                    partly owing to the sinking of the level of the stream, which, as already
                    mentioned, was very anciently restrained by some barrier at Silsilis. About
                    eleven miles above that place is the extremely picturesque temple of 0mbos,
                    placed on a rocky eminence called “Kbm-Umboo,” “the Hill of Urnboo.” It stands
                    within a great inclosure of crude-brick walls, which we see on every side,
                    except that towards the river. There is a portal in this wall of the time of
                    Queen Hatshepu and Thothmes III. The great temple is double, one-half having
                    been dedicated to the worship of Sebek, and the other to that of Har-oer, or
                    Aroëris. It consists of a portico of fifteen columns, of which two have fallen,
                    the foremost being connected by a wall of intercolumniation having two
                    entrances, and behind, there is a smaller portico and remains of chambers,
                    including the two sanctuaries. The earliest name here is that of Ptolemy
                    Philometor <hi rend="italic">(Modern Egypt and Thebes,</hi> ii. 282), unless
                    Champoilion be right in saying that the name of Epiphanes is also found in the
                    temple <hi rend="italic">(Lettres,</hi> 173), and it appears to have been
                    completed by Ptolemy Auletes. There were also remains here of a smaller
                    Ptolemaic temple which have been washed away by the river.</p>
                <p>Nothing remarkable occurs between Ombos and Syene, a distance of about twenty
                    miles. The valley is confined to a very narrow space by the mountains, which
                    take bold forms on both sides near the latter place. Just before we reach it, we
                    see the island of Elephantine, where is the famous Nilometer of the Roman time.
                    The town of Aswan, which represents the ancient Syene, stands amid palm-trees on
                    the eastern bank opposite to Elephantine. It is a considerable place, of greater
                    political than commercial importance, and has succeeded to an older town of the
                    same name, the ruins of which occupy the river’s bank and a granite hill to the
                    south. Among them may be mentioned a pier, which has a well, most probably the
                    Nilometer constructed by ’Amr, the Muslim conqueror of Egypt. In the ruined town
                    is also a small temple of Roman date. Farther to the south is its extensive Arab
                    cemetery, which is full of curious tombstones bearing inscriptions in Cufic
                    characters. In the granite hills to the eastward are the quarries w <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ι</hi> hence were taken the obelisks and very many of the
                    statues which adorned the Egyptian temples.</p>
                <p>The bed of the river above Aswân is obstructed by numerous rocks and islands of
                    granite, one of the latter of which, that of Saheyl, is interesting on account
                    of the numerous hieroglyphic tablets and inscriptions at its southern part. This
                    island is almost a mile and a half above Aswan, and at the distance of another
                    mile from it begin the rapids called the First Cataract, caused by the granite
                    rocks, which almost entirely choke the river. The cataract is so inconsiderable,
                    that during the inundation boats favoured by a strong northerly wind can pass it
                    without aid, though at other times it is necessary to hire natives, who drag
                    them through, but then the principal rapid has a fall of only five or six feet
                    <hi rend="italic">(Modern Egypt and Thebes,</hi> ii. 294), and that is not
                    perpendicular. Nevertheless the roaring of the troubled stream, and the red
                    granite islands and rocks which stud its surface, through which the boat threads
                    its way, give the scene a wild picturesqueness, until we reach the open stream,
                    less than two miles farther, and the beautiful isle of Philae suddenly rises
                    before the eyes, completely realizing our highest idea of a sacred place of
                    ancient Egypt.</p>
                <p>Philae is beyond the proper limits of Egypt, but as it is usual to describe it in
                    noticing Aswân and the rapids, some account will here be given of its very
                    beautiful and interesting monuments. The island is very small, being only a
                    quarter of a mile long, and about 500 feet broad. On its granite rock is a
                    little alluvial soil and some vegetation, with a few date-palms, but its verdure
                    has been exaggerated, and to this it little owes its beauty. It was highly
                    reverenced by the ancient Egyptians as a buiial-place<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0807-0784"/> of Osiris. On.the east side is a small but very
                    picturesque temple, now hypaethral, of the Greek and Roman time, and unfinished.
                    It is 48 feet in width and 63 in length, and has 14 columns with capitals of
                    various forms, connected by intercolumnal walls. The great temple of Isis stands
                    to the westward of this. Its front is formed by a propylon, before which is a
                    kind of court, to be afterwards described. The portal bears the name of
                    Nectanebes IL, but the wings were added by the Ptolemies, making the entire
                    width about 122 feet. Through the portal we enter a court, on the right side of
                    which is a gallery fronted by columns, behind which are several small chambers,
                    and on the left side is a separate small temple of Athor, the main entrance to
                    which is by a door and passage in the left wing of the great propylon. This
                    small temple begins with a portico having four columns with the faces of Athor
                    sculptured in high relief upon each of their sides above the capitals. Beyond
                    this are three chambers behind one another, above the door of the first of which
                    is a Greek dedication by Ptolemy Euergetes IL, and the two Cleopatras. The
                    temple was, however, begun by Epiphanes. The court of the great temple, that of
                    Isis, is bounded by a second propylon of smaller dimensions than the first,
                    forming the entrance to the portico, which is a very elegant structure raised on
                    ten columns, eight of which are at the back and one on each side. It is partly
                    hypaethral, an open space being left between the two columns last mentioned. The
                    beautiful forms of the columns and the bright remains of colour on them and the
                    walls, with the effect of the sunlight through the aperture of the roof, produce
                    a charming effect. Behind this hall are several small apartments, one of which,
                    reached by a staircase, contains very curious sculptures relating to the story
                    of Osiris. The temple appears to have been begun by Ptolemy Philadelphus (whose
                    name is the earliest found there), and was continued under the Roman emperors.
                    The court before the temple remains to be noticed. It is bounded by two
                    galleries with columns in front. One of these is about 250 feet long, and is
                    built close to the western side of the isle, terminating at a small temple of
                    Athor near its southern end. This edifice, w hich is much ruined, was supported
                    by columns with faces of Athor above their capitals, of which six stand; it was
                    raised by Nectanebes II. The eastern gallery, w hich is shorter than the other,
                    is not parallel with it, and thus shows that this court was not part of the
                    great temple, but rather an approach to it. The other remains are of minor
                    importance, and the same may be said of the ruins of a temple on the
                    neighbouring large island of Bigè.</p>
                <p>A few words must be said respecting the eastern and western deserts. The latter
                    is remarkable for two valleys besides those called the Oases. The first of these
                    valleys is that of the Natron Lakes to the westward of the Delta, containing
                    four monasteries, the remains of the famous anchorite settlement of Nitriae. To
                    the southward of this, and parallel to it, is a sterile valley called the
                    Bahr-bela-Ma, or “River without Water.” Yet farther to the southward is the
                    Little Oasis (Oasis Parva), about 100 miles from the Nile in 29° E. long.,
                    nearly due west of the town of Bahnesè. It contains remains of little interest.
                    Within 200 miles due south of this oasis is another, of which the usual
                    apellation is Wâh ed-Dàkhileh, where, near the town of El-Kasr, is an Egyptian
                    temple of the Roman period. This, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, is the
                    most flourishing of the oase≡. About half-way between this oasis and the Nile at
                    Thebes lies the Great Oasis (Oasis Magna). Here, near the town called
                    El-Khârigeh, the ancient Hibe, is a great temple of Amen built by Darius I., and
                    in the same oasis are other ruins of the period of the Ptolemies and Caesars.
                    The Oasis of Jupiter Ammon, that of Seewah, is not far from the coast at a great
                    distance to the westward, and it is not properly included in Egypt. Various Arab
                    tribes occupy this desert, besides the settled inhabitants of the oases.</p>
                <p>In the eastern desert must be mentioned the town of Es-Suweys, or Suez (15,000
                    inhabitants), anciently Arsinoë, at the head of the gulf to which it gives its
                    name. To the southward, a little below 29° lat., are the secluded Coptic
                    convents of St Antony and St Paul, near the sea. Farther south are the porphyry
                    quarries of Gebel-ed-Dukhân, extensively worked under the Romans, and the
                    granite quarries of Gebel-el-Fateereh. Considerably more to the south, at
                    El-Hammâmàt, on the old way from Coptos to Philoteras Portus, are the Breccia
                    Verde quarries, which were much worked from very early times, and have
                    interesting hieroglyphic inscriptions. At Gebel Zabârah are emerald mines, now
                    abandoned as unproductive. At the various mines, and on the routes to them and
                    to the Red Sea, are some small temples and stations, ranging from the Pharaonic
                    to the Roman period. Along the shore of the sea are the sites of several ancient
                    ports, the most important of which were Myos Hormos and Berenice, and also the
                    modern town of El-Kuseyr. The northern part of this desert is occupied by the
                    Ma’âzee Arabs and smaller tribes as far as the Kuseyr road, beyond which are the
                    ’Abâbdeh, an African tribe very different from the Arabs in appearance; and to
                    the south of these, to the east of Lower Nubia, is the Bishâree tribe, a people
                    also of African race.</p>

                    personal, absolute, and independent sovereign; but his relations with the Porte
                    are somewhat less simple. When Selim I. of Turkey conquered Egypt at the
                    beginning of the 16th century, the Memlook power was still too strong for
                    complete subjection, and Selim was obliged to allow his new subjects liberal
                    terms. Egypt still retained practical autonomy, the government being in the
                    hands of a council of Memlook beys, presided <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> over
                    by a pasha, whose duty it was to look to the annual tribute paid to the Porte,
                    but who possessed little or no actual' pow er. This system was continued till
                    the French occupation, and was re-established when the English army evacuated
                    the country. The Memlooks were still the virtual governors of Egypt, until their
                    massacre by Mehemet Ali. The ambitious designs of this pasha opened the eyes of
                    the Porte to the dangers incurred by so lax a control of a governor unshackled
                    by the council of beys. Menaced with the loss of Syria as well as Egypt, the
                    cause of the sultan was espoused by four of the Great Powers; and the Treaty of
                    1840, confirmed by the Convention of 1841 limited Mehemet All’s pow er to the
                    vice-royalty of Egypt, hereditable by the eldest male of his family, ordered the
                    continuation of the customary tribute, restricted the military and naval
                    strength of the viceroy, and imposed certain other conditions, thus reducing
                    Egypt once more to the state of a Turkish province. But in the reign of the
                    present ruler a change has taken place in the relations between the sultan and
                    his viceroy. A series of expensive negotiations with the Porte, ending with the
                    raising of the tribute from .£376,000 to &lt;£675,000, procured for Ismail Pasha
                    the title of Khedive, and the right of succession from father to son. The
                    limitation of the Egyptian army <pb break="no"

                    removed in 1872 by another firmân, confirming all the rights previously granted,
                    and giving the khedive every substantial attribute of sovereignty, except only
                    theyws <hi rend="italic">legationis.</hi> The khedive is therefore virtually an
                    independent sovereign, holding his power on the easy tenure of tribute and
                    military aid in case of war.</p>
                <p>The real work of governing is entirely performed by the present energetic and
                    able sovereign. The merely formal business is transacted by a Privy Council and
                    eight ministers—the agents, not the rulers, of the khedive. The Privy Council,
                    presided over by the Prince Hérétier Mehemet Tawfik Pasha, and consisting of the
                    ministers, the Sheykh el-Islâm, and some other functionaries, examines and
                    reports to the khedive on the work of the several departments. The eight
                    ministries are those of (1) Finance, (2) Foreign Affairs, (3) Interior, (4) War,
                    (5) Marine, (6) Commerce, (7) Public Works and Agriculture, and (8) Public
                    Instruction. Besides these there are the sub-departments of the Customs and
                    Post-Office.</p>
                <p>The provincial administration (exclusive of the separate governors of the eight
                    “cities ”) is divided among the mudeers of the fourteen prefectures, the Feiyoom
                    now being one, each subdivided into departments and communes, or cantons
                    including several villages, governed by ma-moors, nâzirs, or sheykhs el-beled,
                    appointed by the Government and assisted and checked by councils of agriculture
                    and an administrative council for each canton.</p>
                <p>In 1867 the Assembly of Notables was revived, consisting of village sheykhs,
                    &lt;fcc., elected by the communes and meeting once a year to receive from the
                    Privy Council a report of the twelvemonth’s administration. Although the
                    Assembly has not yet attained to the full dignity of parliamentary power, it has
                    considerable weight in the control of state measures.</p>
                <p>By the Convention of 1841 the Egyptian army was limited to 18,000 men, but this
                    was raised to 30,000 by the firmân of 1866, and now all restrictions have been
                    done away. The present force may be placed at an average peace strength of
                    30,000 men, regulated, however, on a short service system, so that not more than
                    half this number are generally at one time with the colours. This army consists
                    of 18 regiments of infantry, 3 battalions each; 4 battalions of riflemen; 4
                    regiments of cavalry, 6 squadrons each; 4 of field artillery, 6 batteries each
                    (2 mounted); 3 of garrison artillery; and 3 battalions of pioneers. The infantry
                    are armed with the Remington rifle; the cavalry with revolver and lance, or
                    sabre and carbine; the field artillery with 100 Krupp guns and 50 smooth-bore.
                    Besides these there is a reserve of 30,000 men, and an irregular contingent of
                    60,000 mounted Bedawees. The army is raised by conscription, irregular levies
                    being held every two or three years. All Egyptians of any creed are liable to
                    conscription, except only the inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria; but immunity
                    may be purchased by payment of a tax. The monthly pay ranges from 20 piastres (
                    = 4s. 2d.) for a private, to £5 (Egyptian) for a captain, £40 for a full
                    colonel, and £75 for a full general. Under the training of French and American
                    officers, the army has been brought into an admirable state of discipline and
                    efficiency.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian navy hardly deserves notice. It consists at present of 2 frigates, 2
                    corvettes, 4 gunboats, and 2 sloops, all unarmoured.</p>
                <p>Mehemet Ali devoted considerable attention to the establishment of colleges and
                    military schools, besides sending young men to Europe for purposes of scientific
                    study. In Cairo and its environs he founded several elementary schools of a
                    higher order than the native schools of the same class; a school of languages; a
                    printing press at Boolâk, from which many valuable publications have issued; and
                    a school of medicine at Kasr-el-’Eynee, between Cairo and Masr-el- ’Ateekah,
                    which has done excellent work. At El-Khankah and in its neighbourhood he placed
                    a military hospital, a school of medicine, a veterinary college, an infantry
                    school, and a school of music; at El-Geezeh a cavalry school; and at Turâ one of
                    artillery. These and similar establishments were well designed and ably carried
                    out. When Mehemet All’s ambitious designs were defeated in 1840 by the action of
                    the Powers, his educational reforms languished, and under ’Abbas the schools
                    were closed and everything returned to the old system. Said Pasha endeavoured to
                    revive Mehemet All’s improvements; but it was reserved for the present khedive
                    entirely to carry out his grandfather’s designs. Besides the revived and newly
                    created military schools, there are two systems of education in Egypt—by the
                    schools established and supported by the Government, and by the old system of
                    mosque education and Arab primary schools,—besides the numerous establishments
                    of the non-Muslim communities. The Government schools are nine in number—the
                    Polytechnic, Book-keeping and Surveying, Law and Languages, Industrial, Medical,
                    Midwifery, two preparatory schools at Cairo, and one at Alexandria. Besides
                    these the Government supports a school for the blind, a normal school, two
                    girls’ schools, three industrial schools, and 23 municipal schools. At the
                    Polytechnic School the course extends over six years, and includes the higher
                    mathematics, chemistry, physics, geology, mechanics, geography, history,
                    drawing, Arabic, and English or French.</p>
                <p>Of the mosque colleges, the greatest, not only in Egypt but in the whole
                    Mohammadan world, is the Azhar, where over 11,000 students, coming from every
                    quarter of the Muslim empire, are instructed by 325 sheykhs in the old
                    curriculum of Muslim acquirement. The Arab primary schools, 4000 or 5000 in
                    number, are the regular providers of education for the fellâlieen, who pay
                    either nothing at all, or a merely nominal sum, for being taught to read and
                    recite the Korân, and sometimes writing and very elementary arithmetic. How
                    greatly the educational system in Egypt has been enlarged of late years may be
                    judged from the fact that, under Said Pasha it hardly cost the Government £4000
                    a year, whilst the educational budget (exclusive of the military schools) now
                    reaches the sum of £40,000, to which the khedive adds £12,500, making a total of
                    £52,500.</p>
                <p>Of the schools of non-Muslim communities the Copts have 16, the Greeks 4, the
                    Armenians 1, and the Jews several academies. Besides these there are two
                    undenominational “Universal Schools,” of foreign foundation, where a moderate
                    education, without religious instruction of any kind, is given to all comers,
                    and many schools founded by the American Board of Missions, and Miss Whately’s
                    admirable British Mission School. The proportion of girls’ schools is extremely
                    small, but their existence, and the fact that they receive the warmest support
                    of one of the wives of the khedive, is a hopeful sign.</p>
                <p>The public works carried out in Egypt during the present reign would fill a long
                    catalogue, without reckoning the Suez Canal, for an account of which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Canal,</hi> vol. iv. p. 789. Railway communication has been
                    established between Alexandria, Cairo, Ismaïlia, Suez, Damietta, the Feiyoom,
                    and Asyoot, the various lines covering over 1200 miles. A Soodân railway, from
                    Wadee Half eh to Hannek, and from near Dunkalah to Khartoom, involving costly
                    and difficult engineering for a length of more than 1000 miles, has been begun
                    with the view of shortening the passage to India, and bringing the produce of
                    the rich southern soil into easier connection with Cairo; these works are,
                    however, at present at a standstill. The canal <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0809-0786"/> system has been greatly enlarged and improved,
                    but a still better result is anticipated from the barrage of the Nile, a plan
                    projected by M. Mougel and now about to be carried out for the khedive by Mr
                    Fowler. In 1871 the work of building a breakwater to defend the New Harbour at
                    Alexandria from the seas caused by the constant southwest winds was begun. The
                    outer breakwater extends above two miles across the mouth of the harbour,
                    inclosing an area of 1400 acres of calm water. The structure rises 7 feet above
                    the highest sea-level, and is of a uniform width of 20 feet. Harbour works have
                    also been constructed at Suez. At a cost of over £180,000, fourteen fine
                    lighthouses have been erected, seven on the Mediterranean and seven on the Red
                    Sea, whereas at the beginning of the reign of the khedive there was but one.
                    Telegraph lines (begun by the enterprise of Said), have been set throughout
                    Egypt, covering nearly 6000 miles, and putting Alexandria into direct
                    communication with Khartoom; and this branch of the public service is managed by
                    English officials. Submarine telegraphs also bring Egypt into communication with
                    Candia and thence with Constantinople and Otranto, and with Malta and thence
                    with England, France, Ac. The post-office was bought by the Government in 1865,
                    and under the management of an English post official has been greatly improved.
                    In about 70 towns and villages offices have been established, and several mails
                    a day are despatched from the chief places.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Egypt have been in a declining state for several centuries.
                    Mehemet Ali tried to promote them, by establishing large manufactories of
                    cottou, silk, and woollen goods, tarbooshes, &lt;fcc., and, especially in Upper
                    Egypt, sugar-refineries. Ibrahim Pasha was much opposed to his father’s policy,
                    and in pursuance of his own views he laid out extensive plantations of olive and
                    other trees, erected powerful steam-engines for the irrigation of his lands, and
                    on all his estates endeavoured to encourage agriculture. It cannot be doubted
                    that had he lived the correctness of his conviction that Egypt is an
                    agricultural, not a manufacturing, country would under his rule have been fully
                    verified. Mehemet Ali introduced cotton and largely cultivated it; the Turkish
                    grandees found that from it they could extract more gain than from other field
                    produce, and large tracts were speedily devoted to its culture. The necessity,
                    however, of excluding the waters of the Nile has caused several destructive
                    inundations; and so long as the cotton growth remained a monopoly of the pasha
                    it was no means of enrichment to the producer. Now, however, that the monopoly
                    is abolished, the trade in cotton is greatly increasing, and this produce will
                    undoubtedly become every year a more important item in the wealth of the
                    country. The old restrictions upon agriculturists have been more or less done
                    away; and the Government, whilst not wholly abandoning Mehemet All’s views on
                    manufactures, is yet alive to the paramount importance of affording every
                    encouragement to agriculture.</p>
                <p>The cotton crop in 1875 extended over 871,847 feddans ( = acres, nearly) and
                    produced 2,615,541 quintals (of 110It&gt;) of ginned staple, 1,954,555 ardebbs
                    (of 5 bushels) of seed, and 3,749,446 loads of cotton sticks, altogether
                    reaching a total value of about twelve millions and a quarter. The wheat crop in
                    the same year was estimated at 6,662,632 ardebbs, of the value of E£7,995,158;
                    maize (durah), 10,502,715 ardebbs, = E£8,193,000; beans, 4,575,273 ardebbs, —
                    E&lt;fi4,575,273; barley, 3,103,085 ardebbs, = E£2,394,000; rice, 98,521
                    ardebbs, - E£738,908. The other crops of Egypt arc chiefly clover, sugar-cane,
                    flax, hemp, tobacco, hinnè, and indigo.</p>
                <p>The revenue is derived chiefly from the land-tax, the tax on date-trees, trade
                    licences, the customs, the tobacco duty, railways, and the Mukabalah (of which
                    an account will be given), and village annuities. Of these the land-tax is the
                    principal item, amounting to nearly half the total revenue; but this will be
                    considerably reduced when the Mukabalah comes to an end (in 1885). The whole
                    revenue may at present roughly be placed at £10,500,000. It is very-difficult to
                    estimate the exact amount of direct taxation on the population. One writer
                    places it at 25s. per head per annum; whilst a recent report states that,
                    including the Mukabalah, the annual payment of taxes has lately reached £4! It
                    is certain the taxation at present exceeds the possible returns of the land, and
                    that the fellâheen are compelled to borrow money to pay the taxes. The items of
                    expenditure may thus be roughly summarized general public administration,
                    £1,300,000; civil list, £600,000; tribute to the Porte, £700,000; army,
                    £700,000; the the rest being devoted to the payment of the debt.</p>

                <p>During the last fifteen years Egypt has acquired the enormous national debt of
                    about £80,393,000. The attempt to Europeanize the country has entailed a vast
                    expenditure. Public works have been carried out at an altogether unnecessary
                    rate of speed, and European contractors have been employed who have not scrupled
                    to drive bargains exceedingly favourable to themselves and ruinous to the
                    Egyptian Exchequer. To these causes of expenditure must be added the dishonesty
                    and extravagance of the Government officials, the waste of money on works which
                    have proved unproductive and useless, and the heavy damages given against the
                    khedive in the extraordinary award of the late emperor Napoleon as arbitrator in
                    the dispute with the Suez Canal Company. To meet the heavy expenses resulting
                    from these causes, five loans have from time to time been raised.</p>
                <p>The first was borrowed by Said Pasha in 1862, and amounted to only £3,292,800
                    nominal, to be repaid in thirty years, interest 7 per cent., and sinking fund 1
                    per cent. The present viceroy then raised the 1864 loan of £5,804,200 nominal,
                    with interest and sinking fund at 7 and 3'87 per cent., redeemable in 15 years.
                    The next loan, of 1868, redeemable in 1898, was for £11,890,000 nominal (of
                    which only £7,193,334 was received), with apparent interest and sinking fund of
                    7 and 1 per cent., really ll <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 56 and l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 68 pt·r cent, on amount received, or altogether 13∣
                    per cent.</p>

                <p>annual charge. The loan of 1873 was for the nominal amount of £32,000,000 at 7
                    and 1 per cent, interest and sinking fund; hut, as only £20,062,658 was
                    received, the interest and sinking fund became really 11 and l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 62 per cent. The actual amount received was, however,
                    slightly increased by part being paid in Egyptian Treasury bonds. Besides these,
                    in 1866 a railway Joan had been raised, of the nominal amount of £3,000,000 at 7
                    per cent. This was repaid in 6 annual instalments of £500,000 each, the last
                    being in January 1874. Two loans secured on the Daïra estates of the khedive
                    have been transferred to the state for value received; these are the
                    Anglo-Egyptian loan of 1865 for £3,000,000 at 9 per cent, interest, with sinking
                    fund of 3’27 per cent; and the Mustafa-Pasha loan of 1867 for £2,080,000 at 9
                    and 3∙4 per cent, interest and sinking fund. The khedive raised also a personal
                    loan secured on his private estates (Daïra) in 1870; £5,000,000 was received,
                    for which £7,142,860 was to be paid back iu twenty years, with interest at 7 per
                    cent on this nominal amount. “None of the Egyptian loans,” Mr Cave observes,
                    “cost less than 12 per cent, per annum, while some cost more than 13} per cent,
                    per annum, and the railway loan even 26'9 per cent, per annum, including sinking
                    funds.”</p>
                <p>These loans hardly sufficed to meet tho necessities for which they were raised,
                    and the exorbitant interest charged on the nominal sums, of which the khedive
                    received little more than half, effectually crippled the resources of the
                    country. In 1871 another fatal step was taken. A measure was passed by which a
                    landowner might redeem half his land-tax in perpetuity by paying six years’ tax
                    in advance, either in one paymentor in six yearly instalments. As, however, few
                    but the wealthiest proprietors could afford this additional charge on their
                    incomes, the six instalments were commuted into twelve, a discount of 8∣ per
                    cent, being allowed <hi rend="smallcaps">od</hi> each instalment. This
                    composition tax is called the “Mukabalah.” By this measure the Government, for
                    the sake of the immediate possession of about &lt;£27,000,000, will sacrifice
                    from 1885 onwards about £2,500,000 annually of certain revenue. For the
                    overtaxed fellaheen the change is most advantageous, if only they can avail
                    themselves of it; for the Government it nearly resembles suicide.</p>
                <p>In 1875 the khedive procured a temporary respite from his difficulties by the
                    sale of the Suez Canal shares to the British Government; and then, at last aware
                    of the critical state of his finances, and of the incompetence of Easterns to
                    mend it, His Highness requested the British Government to provide him with some
                    experienced financier to carry out a thorough reform. In December the Right
                    Honourable Stephen Cave, M.P., accompanied by Colonel Stokes, R.E., and clerks,
                    was sent out, and after some months’ examination wrote an elaborate report on
                    the Egyptian finances. But after Mr Cave’s departure, and the publication of his
                    report, Egyptian credit fell still lower, till in 1876 the khedive, finding
                    himself totally unequal to meet the demands of his creditors, and weary of
                    renewing bonds at ruinous rates, suspended payment for a time. A French scheme
                    was then urged upon him with so much insistance that on May 7 he adopted it in a
                    decree which announced the consolidation of all the state and Daïra loans, and
                    the distribution of a bonus of 25 per cent, to holders of treasury bonds. These
                    bonds had then reached a sum exceeding £20,000,000, and were held chiefly by
                    French firms. The arrangement speaks for itself. It was immediately quashed by
                    the firm actiou of the English Stock Exchange; and the Right Honourable G. J.
                    Goschen, M.P.,and M. Joubert were sent out to attempt the adjustment of the
                    affairs of Egypt. The result was a scheme which the khedive accepted, and which
                    may shortly be described as follows: the private Daïra debt was separated from
                    the state debt; the three small loans of 1864, 1866, and 1867 were reserved to
                    be paid off by the Mukabalah; the bonus on the treasury bonds was cut down to 10
                    per cent.; and £17,000,000 was converted into a preference stock, secured on
                    railways and harbour dues. The state debt was thus divided into three classes
                    :—unified debt of £59,000,000, iuterest percent., reduced till 1885 by a sinking
                    fund of 1 percent; preference stock, £17,000,000, interest 5 per cent.; and the
                    three short loans, interest 7 per cent., redeemable at 80 instead of 100, and to
                    be paid off by the Mukabalah. Besides these, there is the private Daïra debt of
                    the khedive. The scheme is perhaps the best that can be devised under the
                    present perplexing conditions; and if the Egyptian Government can maintain its
                    revenue and will hold to its engagements there is every probability that the
                    debts will be paid off at the appointed times. When the Mukabalah falls in in
                    1885 the three short loans will (presumably) have been paid off. Tho preference
                    debt is to be redeemed in 65 years by the operation of a sinking fund of £35,744
                    a year, and the unified debt in the same time and after a similar manner. With a
                    view to insure the carrying out of these reforms, the khedive has appointed
                    English and French comptrυllers-general, who are intrusted with the collection
                    of the revenue and the appropriation of it to the purposes settled by the
                    financial scheme. A European Commission of the Public Debt has also been
                    appointed for receiving the revenue devoted to the payment of the debt charges;
                    and another commission, composed of three Europeans and two natives, controls
                    the railways and the port of Alexandria. So long as the present arrangement is
                    held to, and if no unforeseen decrease takes place in the revenue, the financial
                    position of Egypt may be considered hopeful. The khedive has been the subject of
                    much censure at the hands of his bondholders. It must however be remembered that
                    he received but half of the sums supposed to have reached him. Of the
                    £45,000,000 received he has paid back over £30,000,000 in interest, Ac., and
                    £10,000,000 went in the Suez Canal indemnity, so that only £4,000,000 could have
                    been squandered. That the khedive is no financier is obvious; but he seems
                    honestly determined to pay his debts, and if there was any dishonesty in the
                    matter of the loans it was not on the khedive’s side.</p>
                <p>The principal exports from Egypt are cotton, cereals, and sugar. In 1875,
                    163,912,336 lb of raw cotton was exported to Great Britain, at the value of
                    £6,668,340; and the total cotton export is estimated at over two millions and a
                    half of quintals. Of beans, 490,257 ardebbs were exported in 1875; of wheat,
                    836,997 ardebbs; of sugar, 986,000 quintals. Maize, barley, flax, natron, dates,
                    hinnè, and other produce form less important items in the list of exports. The
                    total value of exports is estimated at between twelve and thirteen million of
                    pounds. The imports are estimated at about five millions and a half of pounds
                    and consist chiefly of manufactured goods, coals, oil, wine, machinery, &amp;c.
                    Of the whole commerce about 70 per cent, is with Great Britain. There is also a
                    considerable transit trade, which, however, has necessarily diminished since the
                    opening of the Suez Canal.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian measures are—the fitr, or space measured by the extension of the
                    thumb and first finger; the shibr, or span; and the cubit (of three kinds, = 22
                    j, 25, and 26J inches). The measure of land is the feddân, very nearly equal to
                    the English acre, subdivided into 24 keerâts, and each of these into 330
                    (formerly 333⅜) kasabehs, or rods, the kasabeh being a square measure with side
                    of 22 kabdehs, each equalling 6∣ inches. The ardebb is equal to about 5 bushels,
                    and is divided into 6 weybehs, and each weybeh into 24 rubas.</p>
