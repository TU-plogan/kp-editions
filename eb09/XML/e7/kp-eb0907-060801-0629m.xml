                    attention of man, it is nevertheless only within the last thirty years that the
                    phenomena have been subjected to exact investigation. A new science has been
                    thus established under the name of <hi rend="italic">seismology
                    (σearμb&lt;&gt;,</hi> an earthquake). This branch of knowledge, however, has
                    hitherto attracted but few students, and its development in England has been
                    almost exclusively due to the researches of Mr Robert Mallet. References to his
                    principal works will be given at the end of this article.</p>
                <p>Accounts of earthquakes are to be found scattered through the writings of many
                    ancient authors, but they are, for the most part, of little value to the
                    seismologist. There is a natural tendency to exaggeration in describing such
                    phenomena, sometimes indeed to the extent of importing a supernatural element
                    iuto the description. It is true that attempts were made by some ancient writers
                    on natural philosophy to offer a rational explanation of earthquake phenomena,
                    but the hypotheses which their explanations involved are, as a rule, too
                    fanciful to be worth reproducing at the present day. It is therefore unnecessary
                    to dwell upon the references to seismic phenomena which have come down to us in
                    the writings of such historians and philosophers as Thucydides, Aristotle, and
                    Strabo, Seneca, Livy, and Pliny. Nor is much to be gleaned from the pages of
                    mediaeval and later writers on earthquakes, of whom the most notable are
                    Fromondi (1527), Maggio (1571), and Travagini (1679). In this country, the
                    earliest work worthy of mention is Dr Robert Hooke’s <hi rend="italic">Discourse
                    on Earthquakes,</hi> written in 1668, and read at a later date before the Royal
                    Society. This discourse, though containing many passages of considerable merit,
                    tended but little to a correct interpretation of the phenomena in question.
                    Equally unsatisfactory were the attempts of Priestley and some other scientific
                    writers of the last century to connect the cause of earthquakes with electrical
                    phenomena. The great earthquake of Lisbon in 1755 led the Rev. John ΛIichell,
                    professor of mineralogy at Cambridge, to turn his attention to the subject; and
                    in 1760 he published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> a
                    remarkable essay on the Cause and Phenomena of Earthquakes. Regarding the earth
                    as having a liquid interior covered by a comparatively thin crust, he conceived
                    that waves might be generated in this subterranean liquid, and that such waves
                    by shaking the flexible crust would produce the shocks of an earthquake.</p>

                <p>Hie illustration of the movement of the ground is that of a loose carpet thrown
                    into undulations by being shaken at one corner. Although Michell’s hypothesis is
                    still accepted, in a modified form, by some geologists, it should be remembered
                    that many arguments of considerable weight have been urged by modern physicists
                    against the doctrine of a liquid nucleus and a thin crust. Whatever the merits
                    of Michell’s theory, he failed to understand the true nature of wave-motion, and
                    the way in which it is transmitted during an earthquake shock. Modern
                    seismologists believe that an earthquake is a vibratory motion propagated
                    through the solid materials of the earth, much in the same way that sound is
                    propagated by vibrations in the atmosphere. It appears that this view was first
                    suggested by Dr Thomas Young in his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Natural
                    Philosophy,</hi> published in 1807. The development of this view, especially in
                    its quantitative results, lies at the very base of seismology. In 1846 Mr Mallet
                    communicated to the Royal Irish Academy his first paper “On the Dynamics of
                    Earthquakes;” and in the following year the late Mr Hopkins, of Cambridge,
                    presented to the British Association a valuable report in which
                    earthquake-phenomena are discussed in some detail. Since that date the great
                    advances in this country have been made by Mr Mallet, assisted occasionally by
                    the Rev. Professor Haughton and other mathematicians.</p>
                <p>Even at the present day, after all that has been written on the subject, but
                    little is really known as to the origin of earthquakes. Probably several
                    distinct causes should be recognized, for it is hardly to be supposed that all
                    subterranean disturbances, differing as they do so widely in intensity and in
                    duration, should be referable to one common mechanism. Any great concussion,
                    even upon the surface, is competent to produce tremors which may be regarded as
                    diminutive earthquakes; thus the great landslip at the Rossberg in Switzerland
                    in 1806 was accompanied by a local quaking of the ground. Volger and Mohr have
                    suggested that some of the small earthquakes which have been felt in Germany may
                    be referred to the falling-in of the roof of enormous subterranean cavities
                    formed by the long-continued solvent action of water on deposits of rocksalt,
                    limestone, and gypsum. Such causes, however, can have given rise to only very
                    petty shocks, and must be quite subordinate to subterranean disturbances of a
                    more general character. The late Mr Poulett Scrope was led to refer most
                    earthquakes to “the snap and jar occasioned by the sudden and violent rupture of
                    solid rock-masses, and perhaps the instantaneous injection into them of
                    intumescent molten matter from beneath.” He believed that the rupture of the
                    rocks was due to expansion of deeply seated masses of mineral matter, consequent
                    upon either increased temperature or diminished temperature. It is argued,
                    however, by Mr Mallet, on mechanical principles, that such fractures could
                    produce only very weak impulses; but he believes that some earthquakes,
                    especially those marked by long continued tremors, may be due to the movement
                    and crushing of rock masses by tangential pressures produced by secular cooling
                    of the earth. Steam has always been a favourite agent with seismologists, since
                    it is clearly competent to produce great effects by its sudden generation or by
                    its sudden condensation. It has been suggested that water, finding its way
                    through fissures in the earth’s crust, might reach highly-heated rocks and
                    remain quietly, in the spheroidal condition, until a local reduction of
                    temperature suddenly caused it to flash into steam. After all, the origin of
                    earthquakes is probably to be regarded as part only of a much wider question.
                    Whatever causes are competent to produce volcanic action are, in all likelihood,
                    equally competent to produce the ordinary manifestations of seismic energy. A
                    relation is clearly traceable between the geographical distribution of volcanoes
                    and the chief earthquake-areas; and although it is not for a moment to be
                    supposed that the volcano and the earthquake stand to each other in the relation
                    of cause and effect, it is nevertheless highly probable that they represent
                    merely different expressions of the same subterranean forces.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the real origin of the earthquake shock, it is convenient to
                    regard its effects as proceeding from a concussion or sudden blow delivered
                    underground at some definite centre. This centre of impulse is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">seismic focus.</hi> It must be borne in mind, however, that such a
                    centre, so far from being anything like a mathematical point, is in nature a
                    subterranean region, which in many cases is no doubt of very large dimensions,
                    measuring perhaps some miles in diameter.</p>
                <p>From the seismic centre waves are propagated in all directions through the solid
                    materials of the earth’s crust; and if the focus be situated beneath the sea,
                    the vibrations of the ground will be accompanied by undulations of the water.
                    Those waves which pass through the elastic materials of the earth consist, for
                    the most part, of <hi rend="italic">longitudinal</hi> vibrations, like those of
                    atmospheric sound-waves, and consequently not like ordinary water-waves. In the
                    sound-wave the air is alternately condensed and rarefied, the molecules
                    advancing and retreating in the line of direc tion in which the wave is
                    travelling. In a water-wave, on the contrary, the molecules of liquid rise and
                    fall, or rather describe closed curves in planes which are transverse to the
                    direction in which the undulation or wave-form advances. According to Mr
                    Hopkins, both orders of vibration—longitudinal and transversal—coexist in the
                    earth quake-wave, and call for investigation. When, for example, the molecules
                    of an iron bar are disturbed by a blow delivered at one end, both kinds of
                    vibration are generally excited, and hence two waves are sent through the bar,—
                    the longitudinal, however, having a much greater velocity than the transversal
                    wave. But it may be doubted whether the seismologist need concern himself with
                    any but longitudinal vibrations. For, admitting that small transversal
                    vibrations are generated at the seismic focus, it is probable that they would be
                    cut off to a great extent during transmission from stratum to stratum. Indeed,
                    the planes of junction between the several beds in stratified deposits would
                    hinder the transmission of transversal vibrations travelling in a direction
                    normal to the strata. Hence Mr Mallet maintains, that in studying the effects of
                    an earthquake, attention may be restricted, without danger of error, to the
                    longitudinal or normal vibrations, the transversal or tangential vibrations
                    being neglected.</p>
                <p>Around the seismic centre, or mean focal point, the molecules of the rock will
                    first be squeezed together by the concussion, and then separated by virtue of
                    the elasticity of the solid medium; the onward motion is then rapidly taken up
                    by the next set of molecules, which in like manner are pushed against each
                    other, and then spring apart. In this way the pulse, or form of the wave, may be
                    propagated to an enormous distance, whilst the excursions of the individual
                    particles are confined within very narrow limits. It is therefore of great
                    importance to distinguish between the transit of the wave and the movement of
                    the material particles. Each molecule may move only through a few inches, but
                    the undulation may travel for hundreds of miles. The distance through which the
                    individual particles oscillate is called the <hi rend="italic">amplitude</hi> of
                    the wave. After the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857 Mr Mallet found from actual
                    observation at a place called Polla, situated nearly above the seismic centre,
                    that the amplitude of a wave which caused certain fractures in masonry could not
                    have been more than 2∣ inches. He is thus led to believe, contrary to the
                    opinion of most geologists, that earthquakes are not great agents of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n631/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0631-0610"/> permanent elevation. That elevation has been
                    frequently observed after an earthquake is a fact beyond question; thus, Captain
                    Fitzroy found, after the South American earthquake of 1835, that a part of the
                    isle of Santa Maria, in the Bay of Concepcion, had been raised upwards of 10
                    feet, and, although this elevation was followed by a slow subsidence, it is
                    believed that the land was permanently left considerably higher than its level
                    before the occurrence of the catastrophe. Mr Mallet, however, would refer such
                    alteration of level to the action of elevatory forces accompanying the
                    earthquake, but not to the direct transit of the earth-wave.</p>
                <p>From the density and the modulus of elasticity of a given rock, it is possible to
                    calculate the velocity with which a vibration would travel through such a
                    medium. But the rate deduced by calculation usually exceeds very greatly that
                    actually observed in an earthquake. To determine the rate of transit through
                    various rocks, Mr Mallet and his son Dr J. W. Mallet conducted many years ago a
                    series of experiments, at the instance of the British Association. A mile was
                    carefully levelled and measured on sand in Killiney Bay, near Dublin, and by
                    explosion of gunpowder the velocity of transmission through this damp sand was
                    observed. This sand was selected as a medium likely to give a minimum velocity,
                    whilst an assumed maximum velocity was observed by experiments on the granite of
                    Killiney Hill. The velocity in sand was about 825 feet, and in solid granite
                    1665 feet per second. These figures are much lower than those obtained from
                    theoretical considerations, and it is believed that the difference is due to
                    loss of speed occasioned by the discontinuity of the rock, even the solid
                    granite being always more or less affected by joints. The velocity deduced from
                    these experiments accords tolerably well, however, with that observed during
                    earthquake-shocks. Thus the velocity of shock during the Lisbon earthquake of
                    1755 is computed to have been about 20 miles per minute, or 1760 feet per
                    second. This velocity of the vibration, or wave of shock, is of course to be
                    carefully distinguished from the velocity of the oscillating particles. The
                    mischief of the shock depends in fact on the rate at which the earth-molecules
                    are moving, and this is vastly inferior to that of the wave. Thus Mr Mallet
                    calculated from his observations in Naples that the shock of the great
                    earthquake of 1857 had a mean velocity at the surface of 788 feet per second,
                    whilst the greatest velocity of the wave-particles was never more than 15 feet
                    per second, and in many places was very much less. Yet this low velocity is
                    quite sufficient to produce effects of the most disastrous kind upon solid
                    objects exposed to the shock.</p>
                <p>If the earth were a homogeneous solid, perfectly isotropic —that is to say,
                    possessing equal elasticity in all directions —the waves of alternate
                    compression and expansion would take the form of a series of concentric
                    spherical shells around the seismic focus as a common centre. As a matter of
                    fact, however, the crust of the earth is made up of rocks varying greatly in
                    physical properties, each having its own density and elasticity, whilst the
                    rocks themselves are fissured in all directions. Symmetry of wave-surface is
                    therefore hardly to be expected; for the waves will necessarily have greater
                    velocity in one direction than in another, whilst the transit of the wave may be
                    interrupted by breach of continuity in the transmitting medium. The points at
                    which a wave-shell reaches the surface form a curve which is conveniently called
                    a <hi rend="italic">coseismal line.</hi> It is obviously the line along which an
                    earthquake shock will be simultaneously felt, and where the waves will emerge at
                    the same angle. Since the wave-shells are not concentric spheres, the coseismal
                    curves cannot be concentric circles.</p>
                <p>It may readily be supposed that the greatest effect of an earthquake, at least in
                    shaking a building up and down, will be felt at that point of the surface which
                    is situated vertically over the centre of impulse. A line joining this point
                    with the earthquake-focus is termed the <hi rend="italic">seismic vertical,</hi>
                    and the wave travelling to the surface along this vertical has a shorter path
                    than that of a wave emerging at any other point. Just as the seismic focus is,
                    in nature, not a single point, but a considerable space, so the seismic vertical
                    is not a single line, but rather a succession of parallel lines drawn vertically
                    from every point of the focal area to the surface. The mean of these lines may
                    be taken as the seismic vertical. In the neighbourhood of this line the waves
                    emerge at very steep angles, and indeed for a considerable area may be regarded
                    as practically vertical in direction. As the distance from the seismic vertical
                    increases, the angle of emergence becomes less and less; but it is evident that
                    since the focus is seated beneath the surface, the path of an emergent wave can
                    never be perfectly horizontal, unless indeed it be that of a reflected wave.</p>
                <p>Almost any object which has been overthrown or projected by an earthquake-shock
                    may afford direct information as to the path of the wave along the surface. For
                    when the vibration is transmitted to such a solid body as an upright column, the
                    particles are pushed together and then pulled apart in the line of wave-transit.
                    It is clear too that half the excursion of each particle is executed in the same
                    direction as that jn which the wave is travelling, and half in the opposite
                    direction. Each particle of the object when first disturbed moves with the wave,
                    and its velocity increases from zero to the maximum, this maximum being reached
                    at one quarter of the total vibration; then the velocity diminishes from the
                    maximum to zero, which it attains at the end of half the oscillation. During
                    this first semi-phase, therefore, the vibration has been in the direction in
                    which the wave moves. After <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> the first half
                    oscillation has been executed, movement begins afresh, but this time in the
                    contrary direction, attaining its maximum at the end of the third quarter, and
                    then falling again to zero when the vibration is completed. Hence during the
                    first semi-phase, the motion of the particles is in the same sense or direction
                    as that of the wave, and during the second semi-phase in the opposite direction.
                    But in consequence of the inertia of the body its apparent movement if free,
                    will be in a direction contrary to that of the wave during the first semi-phase.
                    Whatever the direction of overthrow, however, it will always be in the <hi
                    rend="italic">line</hi> of wave-transit. Hence the azimuthal direction of the
                    wave is easily found.</p>
                <p>Whenever any two wave-paths, not in the same right line, can be thus traced on
                    the surface, the position of the seismic vertical may be immediately determined.
                    For this line must pass through the point of their intersection. If, for
                    example, it is found by observation on bodies displaced by the shock that one
                    wave moved in the direction AB (fig. 1), whilst another had a path along CD, it
                    is only necessary to mark on the surface the point 0, at which these azimuths
                    meet, and the seismic focus will be vertically beneath such a point. The point
                    indicates, in fact, the centre on the surface from which the waves radiated.
                    Practically it is found that the several wave-paths of an earthquake do not
                    diverge from a single point, for reasons already indicated; but intersections of
                    the paths are crowded together in the neighbourhood of the mean vertical.</p>
                <p>It is easy to understand that the greatest amount of mechanical damage is not to
                    be expected immediately above the focus, although this is the point nearest to
                    the origin of impulse. It is true, the shock passing directly upwards along the
                    seismic vertical might destroy the roof or floor of a building, but it would not
                    tend directly to overturn the walls or produce lateral disturbance. In fact, the
                    side-thrust will be greatest in waves which reach the surface at small angles,
                    and are therefore necessarily at great distances from the seismic vertical. But
                    the energy of the wave diminishes as the square of the distance along the normal
                    increases. Hence there must be some definite position upon the surface beyond
                    which advantage of direction is counterbalanced by loss of energy. Indeed it is
                    generally possible after an earthquake to trace a zone of maximum disturbance,
                    where the damage to the shaken country has been greatest. The line indicating
                    this maximum is termed the <hi rend="italic">meizoseismie curve,</hi> whilst
                    lines along which the overthrow of objects may be regarded as practically the
                    same are known as <hi rend="italic">Vioseismw curves.</hi> After what has been
                    already said, it is hardly necessary to remark that these lines are not true
                    circles, nor indeed are they in all cases regular closed curves.</p>

                <p>Fractures and fissures in walls which have been rent by an earthquake, are of
                    great value to the seismologist, since they often indicate the direction in
                    which the waves emerge at the surface. The interpretation of such phenomena, in
                    some cases very complicated, has been ably discussed by Mr Mallet, who applied
                    the results with excellent effect to his observations on the Neapolitan
                    earthquake. If it is possible to find, from such indications, the direction in
                    which any two waves emerged at the surface, the depth of the seismic focus is
                    easily determined. For since the waves radiate from this focus, any two
                    wave-paths when produced backwards will meet at the seismic centre. It has
                    already been shown how easily the vertical is found, and when this is known the
                    determination of the focus is simplified, for as the vertical itself represents
                    one-wave path it is necessary to find only one other. Let 0 (fig. 2) be the
                    seismic focus, and OA the seismic vertical; if a wave, OB, emerge at the surface
                    B, at an angle 0, it is evident that</p>
                <p>AO = AB . tan 0.</p>
                <p>To find the depth of the focus, it is consequently only necessary to know the
                    angle of emergence of a wave at a given station, and the distance of this
                    station from the seismic vertical. As the stations A and B are comparatively
                    near each other, the earth’s sphericity may be neglected, and the surface
                    between the two regarded as practically a horizontal plane.</p>
                <p>Where several wave-paths are known, several values of AO will be obtained, and as
                    the seismic centre is not a point, like 0, but a cavity of determinate
                    magnitude, the average of these different values must be taken to represent the
                    <hi rend="italic">mean focal depth.</hi> After the great Neapolitan earthquake
                    of 1857, Mr Mallet, aided by the Éoyal Society, spent some months in carefully
                    examining the country which bad been visited by the shock; and in 1862 he
                    published an elaborate report in which his observations were fully discussed. By
                    determining the wave-paths at twenty-six stations in every azimuth around the
                    seismic vertical, he was enabled to deduce the important fact that the mean
                    focal depth of the earthquake was about 5∣ geographical miles. Similar
                    principles have since been applied by Dr Oldham to an examination of the results
                    of an earthquake which occurred in Cachar in India, on January 10, 1869; and he
                    has found that the seismic focus there must have had a depth of about 30 miles.
                    This coincides very nearly with the depth which Mr Mallet believes to be the
                    maximum at which any earthquake is likely to originate in our planet.</p>
                <p>When the centre of disturbance is seated beneath the sea, as appears to have been
                    the case with that which produced the great earthquake of Lisbon in 1755, a
                    water-wave is generated; but since this has less velocity than the earth-wave,
                    it does not roll in upon the shore until after the shock has been felt on land.
                    The height of the sea-wave depends on the depth of the water. During the Lisbon
                    earthquake the wave at Cadiz was as much as sixty feet in height. It is this
                    great sea-wave which, breaking upon the shore after the earthquake-shock,
                    generally completes the work of devastation. At first the water retires from the
                    land, but in a few moments the gigantic wave rolls in, and sweeps all before it.
                    The earthquakes which are so frequently felt on the western coast of South
                    America are generally terminated in this manner; and the great tidal wave which
                    accompanied the earthquake of May 1877, wrought dreadful havoc at Arica,
                    Iquique, and other towns on the coast.</p>
                <p>In addition to the waves propagated through earth and sea, it commonly happens
                    that waves are transmitted through the air and thus produce sound. These
                    sound-waves, travelling at the rate of about 1100 feet per second, may reach the
                    observer either simultaneously with the shock or before it or even after it.
                    They probably result from sudden fracture and dislocation of rock-masses, or
                    from subterranean explosions.</p>
                <p>Almost every object disturbed by an earthquake may be made to yield, when
                    properly questioned, more or less information with respect to the direction and
                    intensity of shock. Special instruments termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >seismometers</hi> have, however, been constructed for this purpose, and have
                    assumed considerable variety of form. Perhaps the simplest seismometer is that
                    suggested by Mr Babbage, consisting merely of a bowl of some viscid liquid like
                    treacle. On the passage of a shock the liquid rises up one side of the vessel,
                    leaving its mark to indicate rudely the direction and extent of motion. As a
                    modification of this simple instrument Mr Mallet proposed the use of a common
                    wooden tub having its inside rubbed with chalk, and half filled with coloured
                    water. An apparatus devised by Professor Cacciatore, of Palermo, and much used
                    in Italy, is constructed with a shallow dish having eight notches in the side,
                    and containing mercury up to the level of the lips. When any oscillation occurs,
                    the liquid is spilt into a series of cups placed under the notches; and the
                    quantity ejected, which may be readily weighed, gives some notion of the
                    intensity of the shock. Since the notches face the four cardinal points and
                    bisecting rhumbs, the direction in azimuth is approximately obtained. Mr Mallet
                    suggested a convenient form of seismometer in the shape of a system of four
                    L-shaped glass tubes having the upper ends closed and the horizontal limbs
                    directed to the cardinal points. The tubes are partially filled with mercury,
                    and the horizontal component of any shock causes the mercury to move in the
                    lower limbs; whilst the vertical component is determined by the motion of
                    quicksilver in a U-shaped tube. In both cases, the movement of the liquid column
                    is registered by means of indexes.</p>
                <p>All these instruments depend for their indications on the displacement of liquids
                    by the shock of the earthquake. But it is obvious that the oscillations of solid
                    bodies may be equally well employed in seismometry. Thus a pendulum free to move
                    in all directions will be set vibrating by a shock, and may be made to record
                    the direction and extent of its vibration by means of a stile below the bob,
                    which moves over a bed of fine sand in a properly-shaped dish. Two pendulums are
                    sometimes used, as proposed by Santi. One pendulum vibrates in a vertical plane
                    directed north and south, and the other in one striking east and west,—the arcs
                    traversed in these planes being registered by means of a tracing-stile affixed
                    to the bob. Professor J. Forbes employed an inverted pendulum, or rod fixed at
                    its base and weighted above, carrying at its free end a pencil or tracer by
                    which any oscillation could be recorded. A modification of the inverted pendulum
                    was proposed by Mr Budge of Valparaiso, in which the pendulum when moved by the
                    first shock was kept in position at the end of a semioscillation, by means of a
                    pawl working in a ratchet on the base of the vibrating body.</p>
                <p>Such seismometers as those previously noticed require to have their indications
                    observed after each shock. Several ingenious instruments have, however, been
                    constructed on self-registering principles, so that however often they are
                    disturbed, each movement leaves a permanent record. The first of these
                    self-registering seismometers was devised by Mr Mallet, and described in 1846.
                    Both the horizontal and the vertical element of a shock are recorded by the
                    movement of mercury in a system of glass tubes, the tubes being placed in a
                    galvanic circuit so arranged that contact is broken by displacement of the
                    liquid. As long as the circuit remains complete, a pencil traces a line on ruled
                    paper wound round a cylinder rotated by clock-work, but the motion of the
                    mercury intercepts the current and thus breaks the line. Two forms of “ball
                    seismometer” are also due to the ingenuity of the same investigator. In one of
                    these instruments, two heavy metal balls are placed on slightly inclined planes
                    supported by a cast-iron table, the axis of which passes through a vertical <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n633/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0633-0612"/> spiral spring. During the passage of an
                    earthquake wave the spring is compressed and the balls displaced,—their
                    displacement breaking contact in an electric circuit which had previously been
                    completed through the balls. That ball which first moves gives the time at which
                    the shock commences, whilst the other gives the elements of the shock. Two such
                    instruments are necessary to form one seismometer, the two being placed at right
                    angles to each other.</p>
                <p>An elaborate electro-magnetic seismograph has been constructed by Professor
                    Palmieri, and has done good service in the observatory on Mount Vesuvius. The
                    vertical movements are recorded by a helix of copper wire, the lower end of
                    which is caused by even the slightest shock to dip into a basin of mercury, and
                    thus complete a galvanic circuit. An electro-magnet, brought into action when
                    the connections are completed, strikes an alarm bell which calls an attendant,
                    and also stops a clock, so that the instant at which the shock occurs is
                    permanently marked. At the same time a second electro-magnet releases the
                    pendulum of another clock, which being thus set in motion unrolls a band of
                    paper, while a pencil continues to mark upon the paper as long as the shock
                    lasts. To record the vertical element a system of four U-shaped tubes is
                    employed, the tubes being placed in different azimuths. Each limb is partly
                    filled with mercury, and any oscillation in the level of the liquid is indicated
                    by movement of a little float connected with an index. The oscillation of the
                    quicksilver also completes a galvanic circuit, and brings into action the
                    electro-magnets already described.</p>
                <p>Although the limits of this article forbid reference to some other seismometers,
                    such as that of Kreil of Vienna, mention should certainly be made of one
                    instrument which is marked by its extreme simplicity. Its construction, which is
                    due to Mr Mallet, will be understood by reference to fig. 3. Two sets of right
                    cylinders are turned in some hard material, such as boxwood. The cylinders are
                    all of the same height, but vary in diameter. Two planks of wood are fixed to a
                    level floor, one having its length in a north-and-south, and the other in an
                    east-and-west direction. The cylinders stand upright on the planks in the order
                    of their size, with a space between each pair greater than their height, so that
                    when one pillar falls it does not strike its neighbour. The surrounding floor is
                    covered up to the level of the planks with dry sand. When a shock passes, some
                    of the cylinders are overturned, the number depending on the velocity of the
                    wave. Suppose the shock knocks over the narrow-based cylinders 4, 5, 6, leaving
                    Nos. 1, 2, 3 standing; then the velocity of the horizontal component must have
                    been greater than that needed to overturn No. 4, but not great enough to
                    overturn No. 3. Hence the velocity (V) can be approximately obtained by using a
                    formula due to Professor Haughton, viz.:</p>

                    and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the angle formed by the side and a line drawn
                    through the centre of gravity to the extremity of the base. The direction in
                    azimuth is indicated by the position in which the overturned pillars are found,
                    since the bed of sand prevents rolling. It is possible to obtain the exact time
                    at which the shock commences by connecting the narrowest-based pillar with the
                    pendulum of a clock so as to stop it at the instant of overthrow. Where the
                    angle of wave-emergence is very steep, this instrument is not to be recommended,
                    since it ignores the vertical element of the shock.</p>
                <p>Catalogues of earthquakes, showing their distribution in time and space, have
                    been constructed by Mallet, Perrey, Von Hoff, Cotte, and other seismologists.
                    The most complete of these statistical works is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >catalogue</hi><hi rend="italic">raisonné</hi> compiled by Mr R. Mallet and his
                    son, Dr J. W. Mallet, and published by the British Associa <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi> tion between the years 1854 and 1858. This includes notices of all
                    recorded earthquakes from 1606 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to 1842 A.D., and
                    is thence carried on to 1850 from Perrey’s annual catalogues. Between 6000 and
                    7Ö00 separate earthquakes are recorded as having occurred in almost every part
                    of the world, both on land and at sea. But though seismic energy may thus become
                    sensible at any point of the earth’s surface, there are, as everyone knows,
                    certain regions peculiarly subject to earthquakes; and it is, in fact, possible
                    to trace seismic bands of variable width following the great lines of elevation
                    which divide the oceanic basins.</p>
                <p>It is now several years since Professor Alexis Perrey, of Dijon, sought to trace
                    a relation between the occurrence of earthquakes and the age of the moon. By
                    careful analysis of his catalogue he believed that he had established the
                    facts—that earthquakes occur more frequently at the syzygies than at the
                    quadratures, that their frequency increases at the perigee and diminishes at the
                    apogee of the moon, and that shocks are more frequent when the moon is on the
                    meridian than when 90° from it. Such a connection between seismic phenomena and
                    the phases of the moon would accord with Zantedeschi’s views on the existence of
                    a terrestrial or terrene tide, views which were based, however, on the old
                    hypothesis of a liquid nucleus in the earth, covered by a thin crust.</p>
                <p>From Mallet’s discussion of his catalogue for three centuries, he was led to
                    detect definite periods of maximum energy. Thus it is found that the greatest
                    number of earthquakes are recorded about the middle of each century; whilst a
                    second epoch, less powerful than the first, occurs towards the close of the
                    century. According to Perrey there is a preponderance of earthquake-shocks at
                    particular seasons, the equinoxes and solstices, which he terms “critical
                    epochs.” Mallet’s analysis of a large catalogue showed a decided maximum about
                    the winter solstice, but Perrey’s other epochs were less marked. In the present
                    state of our knowledge it would be rash to regard seismic force, whatever it may
                    be, as a distinctly periodic force, or to insist upon any of those relations
                    between earthquakes and meteorological phenomena which have sometimes been
                    discussed.</p>
                <p>Annual reports on earthquakes have been published for many years by Professor
                    Fuchs. During the year 1876 he recorded 104 earthquakes, which were distributed
                    among the months as follows :— In January 10, February 10, March 14, April 8,
                    May 7, June 7, July 8, August 5, September 7, October 14, November 5, December
                    9. In the preceding year 97 earthquakes were noticed, occurring as follows :—In
                    January 15, February 7, March 12, April 7, May 9, June 10, July 6, August 5,
                    September 3, October 2, November 9, December 12.</p>
