                <p><label type="entry">ECHINODERMATA</label> (from eχιvoς, a hedgehog or sea-urchin,
                    and δip∕zα, skin), a class of marine animals which constitutes with the class
                    <hi rend="italic">Scolecida</hi> the sub-kingdom <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annuloida</hi> υf Huxley, or, according to some authorities, is a distinct
                    sub-kingdom of the Invertebrata. Familiar examples of the Echinodermata are the
                    Sea-urchins, Starfishes, Feather-stars, and Sea-cucumbers of the coasts of
                    Britain. The characteristics of the group may be briefly summarized thus. The
                    adult presents a more or less marked, although never perfect, radial symmetry of
                    parts; the larva, in most instances, is bilaterally symmetrical. The perisome or
                    dermis develops a calcareous skeleton of numerous interlocking plates or of
                    detached plates or spicules. The muscular tissue consists chiefly of unstriped
                    fibres. The intestinal canal terminates in a distinct anal aperture. An
                    aquiferous or ambulacral system of organs, regarded as homologous with the
                    water-vascular system of the Scolecida, is generally present; and there is a
                    nervous system consisting of a ganglionated circular or polygonal cord, which
                    surrounds the oesophagus, and sends off’ branches parallel with and superficial
                    to the ambulacral canals. The sexes are in the majority of cases distinct, and
                    the reproductive organs are generally placed symmetrically with respect to the
                    radially disposed skeleton,</p>
                <p>In all Echinodermata of which the life-history has been worked out, the larva,
                    <hi rend="italic">echinopaedûtm,</hi> or, as it has been termed by Sir Wyville
                    Thomson, the <hi rend="italic">pseud-embryo,</hi> produced from the egg is, with
                    but one or two exceptions, ovoid, free-swimming, and provided with cilia, which
                    become after a time confined to one or more bilaterally symmetrical bands
                    running transversely or obliquely to the long axis of the body, and frequently
                    borne on processes of the same. In the Asteridea and Holothuridea the larva is
                    vermiform and devoid of skeleton; in the Echinidea, it is pluteiform (Latin, <hi
                    rend="italic">pluteus,</hi> a pent-house, or breast-work), and has a continuous
                    calcareous skeleton, passing into and affording support to the body processes. A
                    stomach, with an oesophagus and intestine, which make with each other an angle
                    open towards the ventral side of the body, is early developed in the Echinoderm
                    larva. The peritoneal cavity and ambulacral system of vessels are developed from
                    diverticula of the alimentary canal. A tube formed by an involution of the
                    integument of the pseud-embryo to one side of the dorsal line may remain
                    connected with the ambulacral system of the adult as the madreporic canal. In
                    the Echinidea, Asteridea, Ophiuridea, and Crinoidea the body-wall of the adult
                    is formed from the blastema; the larval body, more or less of the intestine,
                    and, when present, the skeleton are cast off or absorbed into the new organism,
                    and another mouth appears in the centre of the circular vessel. It is by this
                    peculiar metagenetic mode of development of the Echinoderm within its larva that
                    the class Echinodermata is specially allied to the orders <hi rend="italic"
                    >Turbellaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Toeniada</hi> of the class
                    Scolecida.</p>
                <p>The Echinodermata may be divided into the following orders :—(I.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Echinidea,</hi> or Sea-urchins; (II.) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asteridea,</hi> or Star-fishes; (III.) <hi rend="italic">Ophiuridea,</hi> or

                    or Seaslugs. Of these orders V., VI., and VII. have been extinct since the
                    Palaeozoic period. By some authorities the Edrioasterida are included with the
                    Cystidea.</p>

                    peristomial plates of <hi rend="italic">Cidaris.</hi> The plates are composed of
                    a dense calcareous network, consisting chiefly of calcium carbonate. As the test
                    is invested with an epidermis, and is produced mainly by calcification of the
                    mesoderm, it is to be regarded as an internal shell or endo-skeleton.</p>
                <p>In the typical recent echini the walls of the corona or main body of the shell,
                    when freed from spines, are seen to consist of five zones or areas, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ambulacra</hi> (Latin, <hi rend="italic">ambulacrum,</hi> a walk),
                    composed of double rows of pentagonal plates, and alternating with five other
                    double rows, the <hi rend="italic">iηterambu lacra.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Palaeozoic forms, which constitute the suborder <hi rend="italic"

                    interambulacrum is made up of more than two rows of plates, of which the
                    intermediate and central are hexagonal in form (see figs. 3 and 4). In the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Melonites</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oligoporus</hi>
                    there are extra ambulacra! as well as interambulacral plates. The ambulacra,
                    which <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n651/mode/1up"

                    have near their outer edge small shield-like spaces, «m&amp;ones, bounded by a
                    more or less elevated wall, and perforated by pairs of small orifices or pores
                    for the protrusion of the feet or <hi rend="italic">pedicels,</hi> each pair of
                    pores corresponding to one of the pore plates—the primitive ossicles which
                    commonly unite to form the ambulacral plates. The ambulacra are either
                    homogeneous, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> composed of similar elements gradually
                    diminishing in size towards the poles of the test, or (as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spatangoida</hi> and most of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clypeastroida)</hi> are heterogeneous, having the upper portion petaloid in
                    shape, and the lower with pores scattered in areas not always confined to the
                    ambulacral plates, or arranged in ramifying fasciae. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spatangoida</hi> the anterior unpaired ambulacrum is commonly obsolete (see
                    fig. 5). In the Oolitic genus <hi rend="italic">Dysaster,</hi> the two
                    postero-lateral ambulacra, forming the <hi rend="italic">bivium,</hi> are
                    separate from the rest, and converge over the anal opening; while the three
                    anterior, the <hi rend="italic">trivium,</hi> unite at the apical disk (see fig.
                    8). The growth of the urchin in length is effected by the formation of new
                    plates at the apical end of the corona, and in breadth by additions to the
                    margins of the plates. On the surface of the plates are tubercles of different
                    sizes, each with a knob or elevation, sometimes crenulated, by which the
                    acetabulum of the spine is attached (see figs. 4 and 5). The presence or absence
                    in the tubercle of a central perforation for the passage of a ligament for the
                    spine is an important distinguishing character in various groups of fossil
                    echini. The spines in the young state are ciliated; like the plates of the test
                    they are composed of a calcareous network, and are interpenetrated and covered
                    by the perisome, which contains the muscular fibres by which they are moved.
                    They are short in the <hi rend="italic">Clypeastroida</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spatangoida,</hi> and of various lengths in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hchinoida,</hi> and offer a considerable diversity of form and ornamentation.
                    Dr Gray <hi rend="italic">{Ann. of Nat. Hist.,</hi> i. p. 414) mentions the
                    discovery in Sicily of the fragment of a spine of an echinus, the circumference
                    of which was nearly 1∣ inches, and tho length more than 8 inches. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Porocidaηs</hi><hi rend="italic">purpurata,</hi> a deep-sea form,
                    the spines are paddle-shaped, and very flat, and are serrate on the edges; in
                    <hi rend="italic">Coelopleurus</hi> the long curved spines resemble the antennae
                    of certain beetles. Scattered over the surface of the test, and more especially
                    on the oral membrane, are the pedicellariae, generally regarded as peculiarly
                    modified spines; these, when well developed (fig. G), consist of a long flexible
                    stem, furnished at the summit with a forceps of three pincers or prongs, which
                    snap together, and seize firm hold of any object that comes in their way. They
                    serve for the removal from the neighbourhood of the shell of dirt of all kinds,
                    and apparently also for defence. <hi rend="italic">Calvema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fenestrata</hi> has pedicellariae with four valves. In some Spatangoid genera
                    the corona bears symmetrical bands of minute tubercles with attached spines, the
                    <hi rend="italic">stmitoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fas-cioles,</hi>
                    distinguished, according to their position with respect to the anus or to the
                    apical or the marginal teι minations of the petaloid ambulacra, as <hi
                    rend="italic">sub-anal, circum-anal, intrapetalous,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >peripetalous.</hi> The spines of the semitae have a thick integumentary
                    covering, and except at the enlarged apex, are closely studded w ith cilia.
                    Lovén has shown, the occurrence, in all Echinidea but <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cidaris,</hi> of another kind of appendages of the test, possibly sensory
                    organs, to which he has given the name of <hi rend="italic">sphoeridia.</hi>
                    These are button-like, spheroidal bodies, seldom above ι⅞Ι&gt;^h inch in length,
                    furnished with a short stalk, and normally articulated with small projecting
                    tubercles on the plates of the ambulacra and peristome. Sometimes they become
                    concealed by a layer of the test, in which there remains only a fine external
                    fissure. At the summit or apical pole of the test is a space occupied by the
                    ocular and genital plates, which in the <hi rend="italic">Hchinoida</hi>
                    (Endocyclica) encircle the anus with its anal plates. The fhe genital plates,
                    which are opposite the interambulacra, or interradial in position, are
                    perforated by apertures for the exit of the reproductive products. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clypeastroida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Spatangoida</hi>
                    (Exocyclica), in which the anus is eccentric, and exterior to the apical disk,
                    one of the genital plates is usually imperforate (fig. 7). The five ocular
                    plates are situated radially, crowning the apical ends of the ambulacra; on the
                    surface of each is a depression, having a pore for an ocellus or eye-spot.
                    Always, except in the <hi rend="italic">Clypeastridoe,</hi> the right antero
                    lateral genital plate, or, in other words, that situated to the right of the
                    anterior ambulacrum of the trivium, is larger than the others, and bears the
                    convex, perforated <hi rend="italic">madreporic tubercle</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">madreporite.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Clypeastroida</hi> this
                    is most frequently extended over the other apical plates. The hinder genital
                    plate, with apparently one exception, is wanting in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spatangidoe,</hi> its place being occupied by the madreporite. The Palaeozic
                    Echinidéa differ from the more modern forms by the greater number of
                    perforations of their ocular and genital plates. At the base of the test is the
                    mouth with its buccal membrane and plates. The species <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leskia</hi><hi rend="italic">mirabilis</hi> (the type of the sub-family <hi
                    rend="italic">Leskiadoe,</hi> family <hi rend="italic">Spatangidoe)</hi> has
                    both mouth and anus closed by converging triangular valves. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hchinoida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clypeastroida</hi> the mouth
                    is central in position, and provided with teeth; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spatangoida</hi> it is eccentric and edentulous. The teeth resemble those of
                    Rodents in form, and are arranged in hard wedge-shaped sockets or <hi
                    rend="italic">alveoli,</hi> which by their union form a pentagonal cone. As the
                    outer substance of the tooth is harder than the inner, it is less readily worn
                    away, and thus always presents a sharp edge. Each alveolus is composed of two
                    halves united in the middle line, and each half, again, consists of a superior
                    and inferior portion. The alveoli are inter-radial in position, or opposite the
                    interambulacra. They are connected by transverse muscular fibres, and alternate
                    with superiorly placed, thickish, radial structures, the <hi rend="italic"

                    answering to the racemose appendages of the Holothuridea; (3) the membranous or
                    calcareous madreporic canal, termed also the sand-canal, which runs nearly
                    vertically through the axis of the body, and, communicating with the exterior by
                    the madreporic tubercle, supplies water to 1; (4) vessels radiating from 1 along
                    the parietes of the body, and opening eventually in <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> O basal sacs, or <hi rend="italic">ampullae,</hi> proceeding from the
                    canals of the pedicels shortly above their origin. In the vessels of the
                    ambulacral system is contained a watery fluid strained from the perivisceral
                    cavity. The pedicels, which may vary considerably in shape, are tubular
                    structures, usually terminated by a sucking-disk; they have contractile,
                    muscular walls, and are capable of being protruded beyond the extremities of the
                    spines. They subserve locomotor, tactile, or branchial functions. The
                    corpusculated perivisceral fluid is kept in motion by the cilia clothing the
                    lining membrane of the body and the viscera, Where modified pedicels or
                    ambulacral gills are absent, as in the <hi rend="italic">Echinoida,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cidαridαe</hi> excepted, aeration of that fluid is apparently
                    promoted by branchial developments from the peristome, the hollow stems of which
                    communicate with the body-cavity. The nervous system consists of a slender,
                    pentagonal, red or violet hoop around the gullet, superficial to the circular
                    ambulacral vessel, with five ganglia sending off as many cords, which, passing
                    out between the alveoli, take a course similar to that of the ambulacral radial
                    canals, giving off fine side branches which pass in their course through the
                    ambulacral pores, probably supplying the pedicels, spines, aud pedicellariae,
                    and terminate eventually in the pigmented eye-spots. The principal vessels of
                    the pseud-haemal or blood-vascular system of the Echinidea appear to be two
                    trunks, the one on the dorsal, the other on the ventral side of the alimentary
                    canal; these, according to Hoffmann, communicate either directly or by a
                    distinct trunk with the water-vascular ring.</p>
                <p> From an examination of Echinus sphoera, Psammechinus miliaris, Tοxopneustes
                    lividus, ' and Amphidetus cordatus, Perrier determined that, as maintained by
                    Hoffmann, the circulatory and aquiferous systems are identical; that the
                    so-called “heart” is only a gland, which opens by a canal.into a funnel-shaped
                    space bounded by the lining membrane of the test and the madreporite; that the
                    artery proceeding from the water-vascular ring is distributed upon the first
                    loop of the intestine, forming there ramifications which unite with those of the
                    intestinal vein; and that the vein has no communication with the water-vascular
                    ring, but is connected by ten branches and by its two extremities with a
                    collateral canal, which floats freely in the perivisceral cavity beneath the
                    intestine. Further, he found that the ambulacral vessels and their branches
                    terminate blindly, the circulation consisting simply in a to-and-fro movement.of
                    their contents.</p>
                <p>The reproductive organs are large racemose glands, situated beneath the upper
                    termination of the interambulacra, and opening externally by the genital pores.
                    The sexes are distinct. The spermatozoa have vibratile filaments; the egg is
                    fecundated after leaving the body of the female, and in about eight hours
                    undergoes complete yelk-division.</p>
                <p> The pseud-embryo or echinopaedium, at first ciliated and spheroidal, becomes
                    after a time wedge-shaped; at its broad end appears the mouth or pscudostome,
                    and at the other the anus or pseudoproct. Simultaneously with these the skeletal
                    rods and ciliated bands of the pluteus begin to be produced. The development of
                    the ambulacral system commences with the formation of a sac which lies to the
                    left of the junction of the pseud-embryonic gullet and stomach, and is prolonged
                    into a canal opening by a pore on the dorsal surface of the larva. The blind end
                    of the sac becomes a quinque-petaloid rosette, from which radiate the ambulacral
                    vessels; a new mouth is formed in the centre of this, at the bottom of a
                    depression in the integument of the pseud-embryo, and the canal of the sac
                    becomes the madreporic tube. The skeleton of the pluteus separates, as
                    development proceeds, into several pieces, and is by degrees discarded, whilst
                    its processes atrophy, and the body assumes the rounded form of the embryo
                    urchin. This, however, has in many cases to undergo sundry important changes
                    before its resemblance to the adult is complete. Thus in the young of species of
                    Spalangus the peristome is almost central, and is pentagonal in form. In the
                    Echinoida, before the appearance of the anus in the embryo, its place is
                    occupied by a single plate, the sub-anal, and the anus appears near its border,
                    towards the posterior right ambulacrum. It lies within a circle formed by five
                    imperforate pieces, the future genital plates, and these again aie surrounded by
                    five imperforate ocular plates, with intervening ambulacral plates. The central
                    anal plate persists in the family Salenidoe among the Echinoida. If it be
                    considered as homologous with the dorso-central plate of Marsupitcs, or the
                    basalia of the calyx in other Criuoids, the genital plates correspond to the
                    ρarabasalia, and the ocular to the first radialia.</p>
                <p> The food of the Echinidea consists either of seaweed, and small shell-fish and
                    crustaceans, which are conveyed to the mouth by the pedicels, or, as in the case
                    of the edentulous forms,, of sand and earth containing nutritive material. In
                    the species Anochanus sinensis, one of the Cassidulidcc, Grube discovered the
                    presence of an incubatory chamber at the apical pole of the test, containing
                    embryos in various stages of their growth. Certain species, as observed by
                    Cailliaud, Deshayes, and Lory, have the power at a very early age of drilling
                    for themselves burrows in the hardest rocks, such as granite and grit.</p>
                <p> Allusion is made to the echinus in the writings of Aristophanes, Horace,
                    Martial, and other classical authors. By the ancients it was considered a
                    delicacy, and the common species Psammechinus (Echinus, L.) esculentus, Ag.,
                    especially in spring, when the ova are matured, is still eaten in some parts of
                    Europe. Sir Thomas Browne, in his Vulgar Errors, mentions a notion formerly
                    current that the spines of the echinus were a remedy for the stone, and “films
                    in horses’ eyes.” They are put to practical use in some countries as
                    slate-pencils.</p>
                <p> Various systems of classification have been adopted for the Echinidea. In the
                    following scheme the principal groups are arranged chiefly according to the
                    position of the anal opening and the nature of the ambulacra.</p>

                    perisome are numerous spines, attached to the ossicula on the dorsal surface and
                    to those bordering the ambulacral grooves; sometimes also there are tufts of

                    divaricator and adductor muscles.</p>
                <p>The lower or oral surface of the star-fish with the ambulacra corresponds to the

                    the echinus. The deep ambulacral grooves which occupy the middleof the lower
                    face of each ray are formed each by a series of plates, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertebral ossicles,</hi> articulated to one another by their inner opposed
                    ends, and united by their lower or outer ends to rows of plates, the <hi

                    ossicles</hi> (fig. 12). The outer ends of the innermost pairs of ambulacral
                    ossicles unite round the mouth to form five crests, which bear spines and
                    pedicellariae. On the aboral surface of the body are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tergal</hi> plates (fig. 13). Transverse muscular fibres unite the lateral
                    halves of the arm-segments; similar fibres supply the floor of the ambulacral
                    groove; besides these there are intervertebral and interambulacral longitudinal
                    muscles. The ambulacral grooves are nearly filled with the tube-feet or
                    pedicels, which have a nervous external and muscular internal layer, are usually
                    cylindrical in form and furnished with terminal sucking-disks, and communicate
                    by ducts passing through the ambulacral pores with vesicles lying above the
                    ambulacral ossicles and opening into the ambulacral canal of the ray. In the

                    four-ranked (fig. 14). They are formed by notches or semipores incised one on
                    the distal and the other on the oral surface of each ambulacral ossicle, and
                    lying alternately external and internal to one another in position on successive
                    ossicles (fig. 15). The mouth, which is devoid of dentary apparatus, is situated

                    Ctenodiscus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lηiclia</hi> there is no anus. The
                    madreporic tubercle is situated dorsally in the body disk, near one of the
                    interradial angles; it is oval or slightly pentagonal in form, and the surface
                    is marked with undulating grooves, and is finely perforated (fig. 16). In some
                    genera <hi rend="italic">(Oρhidiaster, Edwηαster)</hi> there are several
                    interradially placed madreporic tubercles. The doubly involuted madreporic canal
                    is invested by the peritoneal membrane, which incloses a sinus, or “heart,” as
                    it has been termed; it passes downwards into a pentagonal circum-oral ring which
                    gives off the five radial canals occupying the uppermost part of the ambulacral
                    grooves. The circum-oral ring may or may not possess Polian vesicles. A dorsal
                    or aboral ring has been described as communicating with the “heart,” and sending
                    off interradial branches to the genital glands, the products of which, in the
                    case of starfishes devoid of external genital apertures, it has been supposed
                    they are the means of removing. The genital glands are racemose masses placed
                    interradially in pairs; their processes sometimes extend a considerable distance
                    into the arms. The nervous system consists mainly of a circular canal around the
                    gullet, with five ambulacral trunks opening into it at their inner ends. The
                    ambulacral neural trunk in each ray underlies a strong band of transverse
                    fibres, by which it is separated from the ambulacral canal above. At the
                    extremity of the ray the nerve terminates in an eye and its tentacle. The eyes
                    are small processes of the ectoderm, having a convex surface or cornea
                    containing a large number of simple, conical, pigmented ocelli. In the
                    peritoneal cavity and ambulacral vessels is a watery fluid containing
                    corpuscles. Respiration appears to be effected by means of water supplied <pb

                    cribriform plates through which the genital ducts pass.</p>
                <p> Among the Asteridea several modes of development have been observed. In some
                    species reproduction appears at times to be effected by division of the rays.
                    The species Pter aster militaris hatches its young in a special pouch on the
                    dorsal surface. The larva on leaving its egg is oval, but subsequently assumes a
                    pentagonal form, and the provisional mouth comes to be placed at one of the body
                    angles. The central mouth and stomach afterwards developed open into each other
                    at the time that the young star-fish leaves the maternal pouch. In other cases
                    the breeding-chamber may be formed by the bringing together of the bases of the
                    rays, and the ciliated embryo develops at its anterior end club-shaped
                    tubercles, by which it can attach itself to the breeding-chamber or to submarine
                    objects. Until these processes appear the breedingchamber remains closed. In
                    general, the larva of the Asteridea begins life as a lobed and ciliated
                    pseud-embryo, a common form of which is the Bipiηηaria. Another form, the
                    Brachiolaria, is distinguished principally by three tuberculated processes at
                    the anterior end of the body. The ambulacra! vessels of the adult are developed
                    in the pseud-embryo from a portion of one of the diverticula of the stomach in
                    which originate the peritoneal cavity and the whole or great portion of the
                    nιesoderιnic structures.</p>

                <p>Distribution in time of Asteridea (fig. 17).—The Asteridea are represented in the
                    Lower Silurian series of strata by the genera Edriaster, Palοe∙ aster (ranging
                    to Carboniferous), Stenaster, Taeniaster, and Urasterella; in the Upper Silurian
                    by Glyρtaster, Palaeasterina, Palaeocoma, Petraster, Palmipes, Lepi-dastcr, and
                    Trochitaster; in the Devonian by Aspidosoma, Ptilonaster, Asterias (also in
                    Carboniferous), and Helianthaster; in the Carboniferous by Schaen-aster and
                    Cribellitcs; by Pleuraster in the Trias; by Tropidaster in the Lias; and by
                    Astropeeten with other still living genera in the Lias and Oolites. The
                    Cretaceous strata are more especially characterized by species of the recent
                    genera Oreaster, Astrogonium, Goniodiscus, and Stellaster.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order III.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ophiuridea.</hi> The
                    brittle-stars (fig. 18) have a general external resemblance to the Asteridea.
                    The body consists of a central disk with five or more simple or less usuaTy
                    ramifying rays, which are sharply distinguished from the disk, are without
                    ambulacral grooves, and contain no prolongations of the stomach. Spines and
                    plates, also hooks (considered to be the representatives of t ιe pedicellariae
                    of the Asteridea), are developed in the perisome. The dermal skeleton of the
                    arms is constituted usually of a ventral or superambulacral row of plates, a
                    dorsal median or antambulacral row, and two side rows of spinous imbricated
                    plates. More rarely the perisome of the arms is leathery in consistence, and
                    bears small plates, of which the ventral are the largest, and perforated with a
                    double line of pores. The internal axial skeleton is formed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">vertebral</hi> or <hi rend="italic">axial</hi> ossicles (fig. 19),
                    the right and left halves of which are united by a longitudinal suture. The
                    axial ossicles are articulated to one another by means of peg-and-socket joints.
                    On the lower surface of each, corresponding to a depression on its dorsal
                    surface, there is a groove for the passage of a radial ambulacral vessel and a
                    nerve. The innermost of the axial ossicles is in two articulated halves, and the
                    neighbouring halves of every two arms are connected with a couple of
                    interambulacral pieces, with the inner edges of which is articulated a single
                    ossicle, the <hi rend="italic">torus</hi><hi rend="italic">angularis.</hi> The

                    which are short flat processes, moved by muscles, and serving as teeth (see fig.
                    20). Right and left of the origin of each arm, within the body disk, on the
                    ventral side, is an elongated ossicle, which in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euryalidoe</hi> unites at the margin of the disk with an arched piece running
                    towards the centre of the dorsal surface. The mouth is in the centre of the
                    ventral face, and at each of its angles is a pair of tentacles. It leads into a
                    simple sac-like alimentary canal, which is without anus. The madreporic canal,
                    the walls of which are strengthened with calcifications, leads from the surface
                    of one of the interradially situated <hi rend="italic">scuta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">buccalia</hi> on the ventral side of the disk into a circular

                    vesicles. The necks of the Polian vesicles and the ambulacral ring give off the
                    diverticula termed by Simrock <hi rend="italic">vasa ambulacralia caνi.</hi>
                    From the ambulacral ring proceed <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> the five radial
                    canals between the superambulacral plates and the axial ossicles. In front of
                    each ossicle they give off right and left branches to the pedicels. These are
                    tentacle-like, devoid of basal vesicles, and, except in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euryalidae,</hi> pass out through openings between the superambulacral and l
                    iteral plates. The nervous system consists of an oral ring, which supplies a
                    branch to each arm, running superficial to its radial ambulacral canal. Between
                    the nerve and the latter is a neural canal. The genital organs are pairs of
                    racemose glands attached to the inner dorsal surface of the disk; their products
                    are shed into the perivisceral cavity, whence they make their way through the
                    genital clefts between the origins of the arms.</p>
                <p> Hermaphrodisni lias been observed in the species Ophiolepis squamata; and in
                    some genera, as Ophioeoma and Ophiaetis, scissiparous reproduction occurs.
                    According to Lütken, this at an early age is more especially exhibited by the
                    six-rayed forms. In certain cases development takes place within the egg,
                    without any free pseud-embryonic stage; but most generally metamorphosis from a
                    pluteiform larva takes place. The bilaterally symmetrical skeleton of the
                    pluteus consist's of eight radially diverging calcareous rods. The development
                    of the embryo commences with the production of two cylindrical solid bodies, one
                    on each side of the gullet, which form cellular blastemic masses, one behind and
                    another in front of the stomach, and a third to the left of the pseudostome. The
                    ambulacral system of the adult is developed from the last of these, which unites
                    with the mass in front of the stomach to form the ventral portion of the body,
                    whilst the posterior mass furnishes the dorsal portion.</p>

                <p>Distribution in time of Ophiuridea.—The following Palaeozoic genera are commonly
                    referred to the Ophiuridea :— Protaster (Lower Silurian); Palawdiseus, Acroura,
                    and Eueladia (Upper Silurian); Eugaster (Devonian of New York). Ophiura (?)
                    occurs in the Carboniferous Limestone of Russia. In the Muschelkalk occur
                    A&gt;pidura and Aplocorna, and in higher Secondary strata Ophio-d'.rrna,
                    Ophioeoma, Amphiura, and other genera.</p>
                <p>The Ophiuridea and Asteridea possess, in a marked degree, the power exhibited by
                    the whole of the Echinodermata of reproducing lost portions of the body. The
                    former have received the name of “Brittle-stars” on account of the remarkable
                    facility with which species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Ορhiocoma</hi> not
                    merely cast away their arms entire, but, at will, rapidly break them into little

                    E. Forbes remarks: “The first time I ever took one of these creatures I
                    succeeded in getting it into the boat entire. Never having seen one before, and
                    quite unconscious of its suicidal powers, I spread it out on a rowing bench, the
                    better to admire its form and colours. On attempting to remove it for
                    preservation, to my horror and disappointment, I found only an assemblage of
                    rejected members. My conservative endeavours were all neutralized by its
                    destructive exertions, and it is now badly represented in my cabinet by a

                    perisomatic system in the calyx of the older Crinoids and forms allied to them
                    is hence a fact of considerable interest to the embryologist.</p>
                <p>The stern is made up of numerous ossicles articulated and interpenetrated by
                    elastic fibres and soft connective tissue. It is attached at its distal end by a
                    root-like expansion, or by numerous, filamentous, branched cirri, having joints
                    similar to those of the stem. Other and unbranched cirri are attached in whorls
                    to many of the ossicles of the stem. Through the centre of the stem runs a canal
                    containing a soft solid substance. In the adult <hi rend="italic">Antedon,</hi>
                    as has been pointed out by Dr Carpenter <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi>
                    1876), the medullary portion of the Crinoidal axis passes up through a
                    pentangular five-chambered dilatation of its cortical portion within the
                    centrodorsal plate, and, reaching the cavity of the calyx, forms the pedicle by
                    which chiefly the basal or dorsal surface of the visceral mass is attached to
                    the calyx. The pedicle enters into the axial canal and passes through out its
                    entire length, more or less imbedded in its walls, to the commencement of the
                    subtentacular canals, where it apparently becomes continuous with the generative
                    plexus of the disk. The stem varies in length, being short in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apiocrimιs,</hi> long in <hi rend="italic">Pentacrinus;</hi> it is round and
                    sometimes moniliform in most Palaeozoic Crinoids, but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plαtycrvηus</hi> compressed as it nears the calyx; in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Woodocrinus</hi> it tapers from the calyx downwards. In the Palaeozoic Crinoids
                    the articulations of the ossicles radiate from the central canal, which is
                    larger than in the more modern forms. In the Mesozoic genera the articular
                    facets are commonly united by crescentic or stellate ridges. In the Silurian
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Periechocrl·mns</hi> the ossicles of the stem are
                    alternately thicker and thinner. The calyx, which may be regarded as formed of
                    the uppermost ossicles of the stem, is composed of several series of plates. The
                    lowest of these is commonly formed by 2-6 pieces, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >basalia,</hi> which in <hi rend="italic">Rhizocrinus</hi> appear to be
                    represented by a single central plate. The basalia in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tesselala</hi> are succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">parabasalia</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">sub-radialia;</hi> after the basalia or these come one or more
                    rows of plates (in <hi rend="italic">Rhizocrinus</hi> three), the <hi
                    rend="italic">radialia</hi> (see fig. 23). In <hi rend="italic">Pentacrinus</hi>
                    the radialia seem to form the commencement of the calyx. Supported by the
                    radialia are series of arm plates, or <hi rend="italic">brachialia,</hi> from
                    the uppermost of which, as in <hi rend="italic">Pentacrinus,</hi> may bifurcate
                    the <hi rend="italic">palmaria.</hi> The ossicles of the arms are sometimes
                    single, sometimes united by <hi rend="italic">syzygies,</hi> or immovable
                    sutures. In the Silurian genera <hi rend="italic">Anthocrinus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Crota-lοcrinus</hi> the subdivisions of the arms are very
                    numerous, and by their lateral articulation form web-like expansions.</p>
                <p>The arms of <hi rend="italic">Poteriocrinus</hi><hi rend="italic">plicatus</hi>
                    bifurcate 4 times, giving 80 rays; the total number of plates in that species
                    has been estimated at 1300 (see J. G. Grenfell, <hi rend="italic">Rep. Brit.
                    Assoc.,</hi> 1875, p. 65). In the calyx of the <hi rend="italic">Tesselata</hi>
                    there are plates, <hi rend="italic">interradialia,</hi> present between the
                    radialia. In <hi rend="italic">Antedon</hi> the central portion of the viscera
                    is contained in a basin formed by the 1st, 2d, and 3d radialia, and by the 1st
                    and 2d pairs of brachialia, and the basal segments of the pinnules borne by the
                    second; and the calyci ne cavity is completed by the perisome uniting the basal
                    segments of the arms. Where, as in the ΛrticwZαta, represented by the modern
                    Crinoids, the disk is more or less membranous, four or five deep furrows radiate
                    upon its surface from the mouth, which pass on to the oral surface of the arms
                    and extend to the extremity of their pinnules. They carry the hollow ambulacral
                    tentacles, which pass out through pores in the perisome. In 1865 Sir J. Rofe
                    demonstrated <hi rend="italic">(Geol. Mag.,</hi> ii. 245) in the case of several
                    genera .of Tesselate Crinoids from the Mountain Limestone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Actinocrinus, Amphoracmnus, Cyathocrvnus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Platycrinus)</hi> that the groove on the upper surface of the arms divides at
                    their base into two channels—(1) a superior channel passing up beneath (in some
                    cases partly within) the plates of the dome or disk to its apex, and there
                    uniting with an internal circular aperture, probably the mouth; and (2) an
                    inferior channel which goes direct into the visceral cavity. These channels,
                    since their discovery by Mr Rofe, have been shown to be generally present in the
                    Tesselate Crinoids. The superior channels, on the supposition that the central
                    opening is a mouth, doubtless served for the supply of food and of water for
                    respiration; whilst the inferior channels probably gave passage to the motor
                    muscles of the arms, and placed the visceral cavity in connection with the
                    ovaries, if the latter, as in modern Crinoids, were situated in the arms. In the
                    Palaeozoic genus <hi rend="italic">Rhodocrinus</hi> the arm is cylindrical, and
                    without a groove on the upper surface, but immediately below its base is
                    situated the orifice of a passage which turns upwards under the dome. What in
                    the Palaeozoic Crinoids is commonly regarded as the anal opening, is situated at
                    the extremity of a proboscidiform tube (fig. 24) interradially placed, and often
                    of great length—as much as 4∣ inches in <hi rend="italic">Poterwcmnus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plicatus.</hi> In existing Crinoids there are two apertures in the
                    disk—the mouth, usually central, as in <hi rend="italic">Rhizocrinus,</hi> and
                    the interradially situated anus. The mouth is closed by lobes of the perisome,
                    the <hi rend="italic">oral valves,</hi> which may contain calcareous plates.
                    Between these run the oral or ambulacral grooves from the mouth to the arms. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Antedon</hi><hi rend="italic">(Comatula)</hi> the alimentary
                    canal passes obliquely downwards from the mouth, then horizontally, and after
                    more than a complete turn bends upwards again, and ends in a rectal chamber
                    terminating in a spout-like prominence. Between the exterior of the mucous wall
                    of the alimentary canal and its peritoneal covering is the intramural space. The
                    double wall of the canal is strengthened by calcareous disks; and it is by the
                    folding of the inner side of the wall, and the resultant piling together of
                    layers of these plates that the vertical <hi rend="italic">columella</hi> is
                    produced. The body cavity is lined by a smooth peritoneal membrane. The
                    ambulacral furrows are bordered by plates, the <hi rend="italic">ambulacral</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">marginal lamell&lt;ν,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhizocrinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pentacrinus,</hi> or, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Antedon,</hi> by elevated ridges of the perisome, produced at the
                    edge into a series of small lobes or valvules, and having grouped on their inner
                    side the pedicels. The epithelial floor of the grooves, there is good reason to
                    believe, is lined with cilia, which, like those of the gullet, serve to create
                    currents in the water and thus to bring into the mouth Diatomaceae, spores of
                    Algae, minute Entomostraca, and other nutritive material.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Antedon,</hi> as has been shown by Dr Carpenter <pb

                    bases with a common trunk, the <hi rend="italic">tentacular canal.</hi> Beneath
                    this, but having no communication with it, lies the <hi rend="italic"
                    >subtentacular canal,</hi> which is usually divided by a more or less incomplete
                    septum. Each of the subtentacular canals is continuous with a branch of the <hi
                    rend="italic">axial canal,</hi> which communicates with the deeper portion of
                    the perivisceral cavity by means of a minute pore situated nearly at the centre
                    of the lower surface of the visceral mass, and partly occupied by the pedicel
                    before referred to. As the axial canal extends downward through the visceral
                    mass it comes into contiguity with the alimentary canal, and opens into it by
                    irregular passages. There is in the arm3 a third canal, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coeliac,</hi> which is a continuation of the body-cavity or coelom, and is
                    separated from the subtentacular canal by a transverse partition. At the
                    junction of this partition with the septum of the subtentacular canal there is a
                    passage, the <hi rend="italic">genital canal,</hi> in which lies the cellular
                    cord known as the <hi rend="italic">generative</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rachis,</hi> in connection with the visceral genital tissue. Enlargements of
                    the rachis in the pinnules constitute the genital glands of the Crinoidea, the
                    products of which may or may not be discharged by special orifices. Towards the
                    extremity of the pinnules, in <hi rend="italic">Antedon,</hi> the partition
                    between the coeliac and subtentacular canals thins away, and becomes finally
                    obsolete, thus possibly affording a means for the circulation of the nutritive
                    fluid of the body, the subtentacular canals constituting an arterial or
                    distributive and the coeliac a venous or collective system of vessels.</p>
                <p>From the arms the tentacular canals proceed inwards to unite with a circular
                    canal situated around the gullet, and having connected with it numerous short
                    processes similar to the <hi rend="italic">vasa am</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">&gt;ulacralia caνi</hi> of the Ophiuridea
                    (see page 635). There is no madreporic tubercle, and the madreporic canal is
                    apparently unrepresented in the Crinoidea. Respiration seems to be effected by
                    the tentacles, and in <hi rend="italic">Comatula</hi> also by the access of
                    water through pores in the oral perisome, communicating with a series of sinuses
                    below its under surface by means of funnel-shaped canals. The central organ of
                    the nervous system in <hi rend="italic">Antedon,</hi> according to Carpenter, is
                    the dilated cortical portion of the axis of the stem within the centro-dorsal
                    plate, which supplies branches to the cirri and the arms, and corresponds
                    probably with the axial sheath which, in <hi rend="italic">Pentacrintis,</hi>
                    sends off cords at the nodes of the stem into the whorls of cirri (see fig. 21).
                    A fibrillar band underlying the epithelial floor of the brachial furrows is
                    regarded by Ludwig as a nerve —“an afferent rather than a motor nerve”
                    (Carpenter).</p>
                <p>The development commences with the formation from the egg of an oval morula,
                    which acquires four hoop-like ciliated bands, and a posterior terminal tuft of
                    cilia. An endodermal sac or archenteron results from an invagination of the
                    blastoderm between the third and fourth ciliated bands; and from this three
                    diverticula, two lateral and one ventral, take their rise, the remainder of the
                    archenteron becoming an alimentary cavity communicating with an anterior
                    oesophagus. The lateral diverticula are transformed into peritoneal sacs, one on
                    the dorsal the other on the ventral side of the alimentary cavity, and their
                    walls coming in contact produce a circular mesentery. In the ventral
                    diverticulum the ambulacral vessels have their origin. Around the alimentary
                    cavity, when the pseud-embryo is scarcely a line in length, there are formed two
                    circles, each of five calcareous plates, which eventually become the oral and
                    basal ossicles of the calyx. From the centre of the posterior circle extends a
                    row of eight calcareous rings, the future stem of the Crinoid, surrounding a
                    backward prolongation of the dorsal peritoneal sac. At the posterior extremity
                    of the row is a cribriform disk, by which the young Crinoid subsequently
                    attaches itself. The sarcodic body of the pseud-embryo begins to shrink, the
                    pseudostome and the two lower bands of cilia disappear, and afterwards the two
                    upper bands, and the embryo then becomes fixed to a stone, seaweed, or some
                    other object. A new mouth is formed in the centre of the disk by the separation
                    of the oral plates, and the intestine by the production of a diverticulum of the
                    alimentary cavity. In the early Pentacrinoid stage of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comαtulα</hi> the basais rest upon the centrodorsal segment, but become at
                    length metamorphosed into a single piece, the <hi rend="italic">rosette;</hi>
                    and the centro-dorsal segment by degrees increasing in size, the first radials
                    come to rest upon its enfolded lip. During the same period, after the formation
                    of an anus, the oral and basal plates disappear. The development of the dorsal
                    cirri takes place as the proximal joint of the column enlarges to form the
                    centro-dorsal piece. At the end of five or six months, when about ⅛ an inch in

                    is attached by a stem, and may be provided with arms or pinnules developed from
                    the upper or oral surface. The stem is short, usually similar to that of the
                    Crinoidea in construction, but without cirri; the joints are rounded, and
                    sometimes moniliform, and usually become broader but thinner towards the base of
                    the body. In <hi rend="italic">Ateleocystites</hi> (see H. Woodward, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geol. Mag.</hi> 1871, p. 71) the calyx is compressed laterally,
                    and shows sculpturing similar to that of the plates of the pedunculated <hi
                    rend="italic">Cirmpedia.</hi> The plates of the calyx are pentagonal, hexagonal,
                    or imperfectly triangular, and are closely united together; they vary in number,
                    and in <hi rend="italic">Splκeronites</hi> (1 in fig. 28) are very numerous. In

                    plates, which may be regarded as basalia, parabasalia, and radialia. According

                    surrounding the mouth, which vary considerably in number (fig. 29). The plates
                    are frequently ornamented with grooves and tubercles. Arms and pinnules are not

                    >punctatus,</hi> Billings, the arms are free; sometimes they are wanting, and
                    the pinnules are attached to the upper portion of tho calyx. Commonly the arms
                    resemble ambulacra, and are reflected towards the base of the calyx, and closely
                    applied to its surface. Pores on the antambulacral surface may be absent <hi

                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Cαryocriηus</hi><hi rend="italic">ornatus</hi> there are

                    <hi rend="italic">Pleurocystites</hi> are not tubular as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caryoeriwus,</hi> but are made up of numerous parallel inward folds of an

                    bordered by peculiar plates. A small perforation alongside the mouth, considered
                    to be the anus, is generally present. It has sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinoencrinus</hi> (fig. 30) and <hi rend="italic">Λpiocystites,</hi> the form
                    of “an arched or crescentic groove terminating apparently at each end with a

                    middle line of a suture, as if in the junction of two oral plates” (Forbes).
                    Almost invariably, on the oral portion of the body, interradially placed, is a
                    round or oval aperture covered by a pyramid of 5 or 6 triangular valves. This in
                    the opinion of most authorities is probably the ovarial orifice; but according
                    to Mr Billings it is an oro-anal aperture, the central opening or mouth above
                    mentioned being an “ambulacral orifice.” <hi rend="italic">Cystidaι</hi> first

                    <hi rend="italic">Pentremites</hi> two are double; succeeding the basais is a
                    row of five pieces, and into the deep clefts of the upper portion of these fit
                    the lower ends or apices of the ambulacra; a third series of five small,
                    deltoid, interradial plates occupy the spaces between the oral portions of the

                    formed by a double series of ossicles running from a median line to the border,
                    where they support pinnules; beneath the ossicles is usually a lanceolate plate

                    through which air from the water could pass by diffusion.” The expanded ends of
                    the neighbouring tubes of each two ambulacra form at the summit of the test four
                    double and two single apertures commonly termed “ovarian orifices;” between the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Order VHP—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Holothurtdea.</hi> —The
                    Holothuridea, Sea-slug3, Trepangs, or Sea-cucumbers (figs. 33 and 34) have a
                    long, cylindroid, sometimes flattened body, which is without shell, and is brown
                    to purplish-red in colour. The perisome, which is unciliated, is composed of
                    three layers,— a structureless epidermis, a cellular dermis, and an internal
                    elastic layer. The two interior layers contain calcareous spiculae, which vary
                    much according to the species, and may take the shape of perforated disks,
                    wheels, anchors, and hooks (fig. 35). Rarely the dorsal integument may develop
                    an armature of overlapping plates <hi rend="italic">(Psolus),</hi> which may
                    bear spines <hi rend="italic">(Echinocucumis).</hi> Underlying the perisome is a
                    layer of circular muscular fibres, some of which pass into the mesenteries; a
                    second internal set of five simple orpaired bands of longitudinal muscular
                    fibres are attached at one end to the radial pieces of the calcareous oral ring,
                    and supply branches to the oral tentacles, and at the other are inserted into
                    the sphincter of the anus. It is by means of the longitudinal muscles that the
                    Holothurid, when irritated, effects the discharge of its viscera at the hinder
                    extremity of its body. In the midst of a circle of tentacles, five or multiples
                    of five in number, is the mouth, which is without dental apparatus. The
                    tentacles vary considerably in shape, and may be cylindrical, shield-shaped,
                    pinnate, or ramified. They serve as organs of touch, of nutrition, and
                    occasionally also of locomotion. The alimentary canal is simple, and usually
                    longer than the body, so as to be two or three times folded on itself; it is
                    attached to the interior surface of the body by mesenteries, and may terminate
                    in a cloaca. Its w alls are composed of an external layer of circular, and an
                    internal layer of longitudinal muscular fibres, and an innermost cellular
                    lining. In common with the peritoneal surface of the body, it is ciliated. Two,
                    or more rarely four or five, branched processes of the cloaca, the <hi
                    rend="italic">respiratory trees</hi> or <hi rend="italic">water-lungs,</hi> are
                    ordinarily present, and are connected to the body-wall by a mesentery or by
                    threads (fig. 36). They appear to be excretory in function, water being
                    continually passed into and out of them through the contractile cloaca. Their
                    ultimate ramifications terminate in minute openings, by means of which they
                    appear to have communication with the peritoneal cavity. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinοcucumis</hi> the respiratory trees are only singlebranched. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Synαpta,</hi> in which they do not occur, there are funnel-shaped
                    ciliated bodies attached to the mesentery of the aliment-ary canal. The

                    in many cases to be surrounded by a plexus of the pseudhaemal system of vessels.

                    protrusion externally. The main trunks of the pseudhaemal system, which is often
                    exceedingly complex, are two vessels, one on the dorsal, the other on the
                    ventral face of the intestine, which are connected with each other-by capillary
                    reticulations. The calcareous ring surrounding the gullet, already referred to,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n661/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0661-0640"/> consists usually of five interradial, and five
                    notched or perforated radial plates united by muscles—the homologues of the
                    auriculae of the Echinidea. A circlet of plates, in certain species, surrounds
                    the anus. The fluid filling the various canals of the ambulacral system contains
                    nucleated cells. The ambulacral circular vessel lies behind the calcareous ring;
                    it gives off from one to five or more Polian vesicles, also one or more
                    madreporic canals. Calcareous spiculae are contained in the wall of the
                    madreporic canal, and often it is terminated at the free end by a cribriform
                    plate similar to a madreporite. By means of the madreporic canal the ambulacral
                    vessels communicate with the peritoneal cavity. From the ambulacral ring there
                    proceed five, sometimes more tentacular canals, which supply caecal branches to
                    the tentacles, and usually, also, five ambulacral canals, which give rise to as
                    many rows of pedicels situated in most cases radially, and forming a dorsal
                    bivium and ventral trivium. Sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic">Psolus,</hi> the
                    pedicels are irregularly dispersed over the whole perisome, or they may be met
                    with only on the lower surface of the body, where they subserve locomotion. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Molpadia</hi> and its allies there are ambulacral canals, but
                    no pedicels; in the <hi rend="italic">Synaptidoe</hi> the canals are wanting.
                    The sexual organs are one or two groups of branched tubuli, which open either on
                    the dorsal surface or between the two dorsal tentacles. Except in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Synaptidoe,</hi> and apparently also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liodermatidoe,</hi> the sexes are distinct. The nervous system consists of a
                    circular cord, lying above the ambulacral ring, and giving off five apparently
                    hollow branches, which pass through holes or notches in the radial plates of the
                    calcareous ring, to proceed down the centre of the longitudinal muscular bands
                    of the body.</p>
                <p>Development is direct in <hi rend="italic">Holοthuriα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tremula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Peηtacta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >doliolum;</hi> and a species of <hi rend="italic">Synapta</hi> is viviparous.
                    The majority of the Holothuridea undergo metamorphoses, during which, however,
                    no portion of the echinopaedium is discarded. By invagination of the morula an
                    intestinal cavity is produced, into which an ectodermic invagination opens,
                    forming the upper portion of the alimentary canal. The cilia that at first
                    clothe the body commonly become limited to a doubly bent band, the larva
                    developing into an <hi rend="italic">auricularia,</hi> which has sac-like
                    processes, and occasionally spicules, but never a skeleton. Growing less
                    transparent, the auricularia loses its lateral processes, the mouth disappears,
                    and the larva reaches the “pupa-stage,” in which the body is surrounded by five
                    ciliated hoops. A new mouth with tentacles is now developed, the ciliated bands
                    are lost, and the animal attains the same shape as the adult. The peritoneal
                    cavity and the ambulacral system both originate in a caecal process of the
                    archenteron or primitive endodermal sac, which, separating from the latter,
                    forms what has been termed the <hi rend="italic">vaso-peritoneal vesicle.</hi>
                    This gives off a process which opens on the dorsal surface, and which eventually
                    furnishes the madreporic canal. A portion of the vesicle remains in connection
                    with this process, and is transformed into the ambulacral vessels; the other
                    portion becomes two sausage-shaped vesicles at the sides of the alimentary
                    canal, above and below which they grow together, and form a continuous space,
                    the future peritoneal cavity. The inner and outer wall of the chamber thus
                    resulting become attached respectively to the parietes of the body and to the
                    alimentary canal, and mainly contribute to the production of their peritoneal
                    and muscular layers.</p>
                <p>The Holothuridea are creeping in habit; some, however, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synaptidoe</hi> are able to swim. The apodal forms move themselves by
                    contractions of the body, and by means of their tentacles. The Holothuridea
                    derive their nourishment from the sand which they swallow, and from Diatomaceae,
                    Foraminifera, and other minute marine organisms. Among the internal parasites of
                    the Holothuridea are small fishes of the genus <hi rend="italic">Fierasfer,</hi>
                    embryos of the gasteropod <hi rend="italic">Euioeoncha,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mirabilis,</hi> and Copepod crustaceans <hi rend="italic">(Pinnotheres).</hi>
                    Certain species of <hi rend="italic">Holothuria</hi> are much esteemed in China
                    as food, and constitute an important article of commerce with that country.</p>
                <p>The Holothuridea may be grouped as follows :—</p>
                <p>I. APNΕUMONA. Bespiratory trees and Cuvierian organs absent; mouth and anus at

                    same end of it, the former surrounded by ten tentacles and ten calcareous
                    plates, the latter by as many papillae and plates; five ambulacra diverge from
                    the anal, and five from the oral region of the body; pedicels in two rows. Ex.

                <p>Mr C. Moore, F.G.S. <hi rend="italic">(Rep. Brit. Assoc.,</hi> 1872, ρ. 117),
                    lias described wheel-like spiculae of four species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chirodota,</hi> one from the Inferior Oolite, one from the Upper Lias, and two
                    from the Middle Lias. “They are formed of a number of minute wheel-spokes,
                    varying from 5 to 13, which start from a central axis, and are surrounded on the
                    outside by a wheel-tire; on the inner edge of some species are a series of very
                    minute teeth, extending over the central cavity.” Mr R. Etheridge, jun. (in the
