                    native woollen stuffs, pottery, and silver work, but also a considerable variety
                    of European goods. In the principal square there is a large mosque dedicated to
                    Abraham, who, according to Mahometan legend, was slain in the city; and in its
                    immediate vicinity is a pond shaded by fine pomegranate, plain, and cypress
                    trees, and tenanted from time immemorial by sacred fish. The only ancient
                    remains are those of a tower ascribed by tradition to Nimrod; but in the
                    neighbourhood there exist extensive catacombs with numerous inscriptions of an
                    early date. The prevailing language is Turkish, though more than three-fourths
                    of the inhabitants are Christian. The population was estimated about 1796 by
                    Olivier as from 20,000 to 24,000; by Buckingham at 50,000; and, in 1873, by
                    Chernik at 40,000. There are two mission establishments, an American and a
                    French, and in connection with the former a school with about 250 pupils. The
                    outskirts are occupied by melongardens, vineyards, and mulberry plantations.</p>
                <p>Nothing is known of the origin of Edessa. It has been suggested that probably the
                    early inhabitants were Sabaeans, and that the sacred fish originally belonged to
                    the worship of Atergatis. According to the Targum of the pseudo-Jonathan,
                    Jerome, and Ephraem Syrus, the city is to be identified with the Erech of
                    Genesis x.</p>
                <p>10, and the local tradition of the Arabs and Jews makes it the same as Ur of the
                    Chaldees; but there is no historical basis for either identification, though the
                    former has received the support of Michaelis, Buttmann, and Von Bohlen. The
                    first authentic mention of the city connects it with Seleucus, who appears to
                    have greatly increased its prosperity, and was probably the bestower of the name
                    by which it is best known in history. This, according to Stephanus, was taken
                    from the Macedonian Edessa, from the abundance of the water in both cities, but
                    a modern etymologist recognizes the Syrian Haditha or New Town. Another
                    designation, Callirhoe, found in the ancient writers, undoubtedly alludes to its
                    fountain; and it is at least possible that this may be the derivation of its
                    modern name—Urlιoi among the Syrians, Er Roha among the Arabs, and Orfa among
                    the Turks and Christians. In the time of Antiochus VII., about 135 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.o.,</hi> the city became the seat or centre of the Osrhoenic
                    kingdom, founded by Orhoi-Bar-Khevyo, and governed for centuries by a series of
                    elective monarchs. Of these the eighth in succession, Abgar Bar-Abgar, fought
                    against Lucullus, but afterwards sided with the Romans; the fifteenth Abgar
                    Uchomo is famous for the legendary correspondence with Christ reported by
                    Eusebius. The city was plundered by Trajan’s general Lusius Quietus, and the
                    kingdom became tributary in 116. Restored by Hadrian it was finally abolished by
                    Caracalla in 217, and a Roman military colony was established with the title of
                    Colonia Marcia Edessorum. Meanwhile Christianity had been taking fast root in
                    the city, the first church having been built as early at least as 202. By the
                    time of Julian, the wealth of the Christians was sufficient to attract his
                    revengeful cupidity; and in the course of the following century, the number of
                    monasteries alone .is said to have exceeded 300. Great theological schools were
                    established, and the city, in fact, became one of the chief seats of Oriental
                    learning. Most famous of all was the <hi rend="italic">Schola Persica</hi> or
                    Persian School; but its professors having adopted the Nestorian heresy were
                    expelled by Martyrus the bishop, and the building was destroyed in 489, and
                    replaced by St Mary’s Church. The prosperity of the city gradually disappeared
                    during the next five centuries, as it passed successively into the hands of the
                    Arabs and the Seljuks. From the latter it was captured in 1097 by Baldwin de
                    Bouillon, and for the next fifty years it continued an independent Christian
                    countship. Baldwin’s successors were his cousin Baldwin</p>
                <p>11. (1100-1118), Jocelin de Courtenay, surnamed the Great (1118- 1131), and
                    Jocelin II. (1131-1144). The negligence of this last count permitted the city to
                    fall into the hands of Zengi of Mosul, and in 1466, the attempt of the
                    inhabitants to recover their independence brought down the vengeance of Zengi’s
                    successor Nur-eddin. The sultans of Egypt and Syria obtained possession in 1181,
                    the Byzantines in 1234, the Mongolians under Tamurlane about 1393, the Turkomans
                    and the Persians at a later date, and finally the Turks in 1637.</p>
