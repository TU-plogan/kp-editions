                    distinguished from those of Shushan, which elsewhere (Dan. viii. 2) is placed in
                    Elam. Strabo (xv. 3, 12, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> fcc.) makes Susiana a part
                    of Persia proper, but a comparison of his account with those of Ptolemy (vi. 3,
                    1, &amp;c.) and other writers would limit it to the mountainous district to the
                    east of Babylonia, lying between the Oroatis and the Tigris, and stretching from
                    India to the Persian Gulf. Along with this mountainous district went a fertile
                    low tract of country on the western side, which also included the marshes at the
                    mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris and the north-eastern coast land of the Gulf.
                    This low tract, though producing large quantities of grain, was intensely hot in
                    summer; the high regions, however, were cool and well watered. The whole country
                    was occupied by a variety of tribes, all speaking agglutinative dialects allied
                    to each other and to the so-called Accadian language of primitive Chaldea, but
                    in very different stages of civilization. The most important of the tribes were
                    the natives of southern Susiana, called Anzan in the cuneiform inscriptions, who
                    established their capital at Susa, and founded a powerful monarchy there at a
                    very early date. Strabo (xi. 13, 3, 6), quoting from Nearchus, seems to include
                    them under the Elymaeans, whom he associates with the Uxii, and places on the
                    frontiers of Persia and Susa; but Pliny more correctly makes the Eulaeus the
                    boundary between Susiana and Elymais (W. 7Z., vi. 29-31). The Uxii are described
                    as a robber tribe in the mountains adjacent to Media, and their name is
                    apparently to be identified λvith the title given to the whole of Susiana in the
                    Persian cuneiform inscriptions, <hi rend="italic">Uwaja,</hi> or “Aborigines.”
                    Uwaja is probably the origin of the modern Khuzistan, though Mordtmann would
                    derive the latter from “a sugar-reed.” Immediately border ing on the Persians
                    were the Amardians or Mardians, in whom we may see the Apharsathchites and
                    Λpharsites of Ezra iv. 9, as well as Khapirti or Khalpriti, the name given to
                    Susiana in the Protomedic cuneiform texts, which are written in the
                    agglutinative dialect of the Turanian Medes and northern Elamites. Khapirti
                    appears as Aipir in the inscriptions of Mal-Λmir. Passing over the Messabatae,
                    who inhabited a valley which may perhaps be the modern Mâh-Sabadan, as well as
                    the level district of Y amutbal or Yatbur (with its capital Duran or Deri) which
                    separated Elam from Babylonia, and the smaller districts of Characene,
                    Cabandene, Corbiana, and Gabiene mentioned by classical authors, we come to the
                    fourth principal tribe of Susiana, the Cissii (Aesch., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pers.,</hi> 16; Strab. xv. 3, 2) or Cossaei (Strab. xi. 5, 6; xvi. 11, 17;
                    Arr., <hi rend="italic">Ind.,</hi> 40; Polyb. V. 54, Ac.), the Cassi of the
                    cuneiform inscriptions. So <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0818-0795"/> important were they, that the whole of Susiana
                    vas sometimes called Cissia after them as by Herodotus (iii. 91; v. 49,
                    &amp;c.). In fact, Susiana was only a late name for the country, dating from the
                    time when Susa had been made a capital of the Persian empire. The Accadians
                    called it Numma, “the highlands” (compare the Vogul <hi rend="italic"
                    >unman,</hi> “high ”), or ’Subarti, with the same meaning, and of this the
                    Semitic <hi rend="italic">Blamu</hi> (from ∏Sy) was only a translation. Such was
                    also the signification of the native Khapir or Aipir, also written Khubur, which
                    is made synonymous with ’Subarti (comp. Eber, Gen. xi. 14). The. Assyrian
                    inscriptions have disposed of the suggestion, first made by J. Müller and
                    Lassen, that Elam is a corrupt form of the Indo-European Airyama.</p>
                <p>The principal mountains of Elam were on the north, called Charbanus aud
                    Cambalidus by Pliny (vi. 27, 31), and belonging to the Parachoathras chain. In
                    the inscriptions they have the general name of “mountains of the east,” which
                    extended into Media, where “the mountain of Nizir,” or “the mountain of the
                    world,” the present mount El wend, was believed to be the spot on which the ark
                    had rested, and the cradle of mankind. There were numerous rivers flowing into
                    either the Tigris or the Persian Gulf. The most important were the Ulai or
                    Eulaeus <hi rend="italic">(Kuran)</hi> with its tributary the Pasitigris, the
                    Choasp.es <hi rend="italic">(Kerkhαh),</hi> the Coprates (river of <hi
                    rend="italic">Diz</hi> called Itite in the inscriptions), the Hedyphon or
                    Hedypnus <hi rend="italic">(Jerrâhi),</hi> and the Oroatis <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hiηdyaη),</hi> besides the monumental Surappi and Ukni, or “white river,”
                    perhaps to be identified with the Hedyphon and Oroatis, which fell into the sea
                    in the neighbourhood of the Caldai of Bit-Yagina, of Khindar, and of the
                    Gambulai, in the marshy region at the mouth of the Tigris. Shushan or Susa, the
                    capital, now marked by the mounds of <hi rend="italic">Shush,</hi> stood near
                    the junction of the Choaspes and Eulaeus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sosa);</hi>
                    and Badaca, Madaktu in the inscriptions, lay between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shapur</hi> and the river of <hi rend="italic">Diz.</hi> Among the other chief
                    cities mentioned in the inscriptions, may be named Naditu, Khaltemas, Din-sar,
                    Bubilu, Bit·imbi, Khidalu, and Nagitu on the sea coast. Here, in fact, lay some
                    of the oldest and wealthiest towns, the sites of which have, however, been
                    removed inland by the silting up of the shore. The monumental Dilvun, for
                    instance, which according to Sargon was an island 30 <hi rend="italic"
                    >caspu</hi> from the land, is now probably represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bunder Dellim.</hi></p>
                <p>The civilization of southern Elam was of very great antiquity. The Aecadai or
                    “Highlanders,” who founded the cities and civilization of primaeval Clraldea,
                    descended from its mountains, carrying with them the picture-writing which
                    afterwards developed into the cuneiform syllabary. An examination of the
                    syllabary shows us that the only animals with which they were acquainted were
                    the ass, the ox, the sheep, the gazelle, the antelope, the bear, the wild bull,
                    the dove, the snake, the fly, the flea, the moth, the bee, and different species
                    of fish,—horses, called the “animals of the east,” being a subsequent
                    importation. Neither the palm nor the vine were known before their emigration
                    into Babylonia; indeed, Strabo states that the vine was first introduced into
                    Susiana by the Macedonians. The different tribes of the country were constantly
                    invading Babylonia, and from time to time imposed their dominion upon it. About
                    2280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (according to the date furnished by
                    Assur-bani-pal), the Elamite king Cudur-nankhundi carried away the image of the
                    goddess Nana from Babylonia to Shushan, and in Gen. xiv. we find Chedorlaomer or
                    Cudur-lagamar suzerain of the Babylonian princes. Cπdur-mabug, the son of
                    Simti-Silkhak, king of Yamutbal, founded a dynasty in Chaldea, which lasted for
                    two generations, his son Rim-Agu or Eri-Acu (Arioch) of L·arsa being afterwards
                    conquered by Khammuragas. Khammuragas himself was a Cassite, and the dynasty he
                    founded at Babylon, which he made for the first time the capital of the country,
                    continued for several centuries, and was only overthrown at last by the Assyrian
                    monarch, Tiglath-Adar, in 1270 r·.c. Another Cassite dynasty had ruled Babylonia
                    at a very much earlier time, and one of its kings, Agu-kak-rimi, had restored
                    the great temple of Bel at Babylon. Elamite raids recommenced within a few years
                    after the overthrow of the second Cassite dynasty, Elamites from time to time
                    appear as kings of Babylonia, and about 1200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    whole country was ravaged and desolated by the Elamite Cudur-nankhundi II.
                    Revenge for this, however, was shortly afterwards taken by the Babylonian
                    Nebuchadrezzar. Subsequently, we find Elam and Babylon in alliance against the
                    growing power of Assyria, and in the 8th and 7th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> when Babylonia was alternately under the sway of the Assyrian
                    princes and of Chaldean and other adventurers ft om the districts on the Persian
                    Gulf, Elam played a large part in its political history. Tiglath-Pileser II., in
                    745 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> first overran the sea-coast as far as the
                    Ukni, and in 721 Sargon met Khumba·nigas the elamite in battle at Duran, and
                    drove him across the Assyrian frontier. After the establishment of the Assyrian
                    empire in the west and north, the reduction of Babylonia to a dependent province
                    became a necessity, and this involved the weakening and final conquest of the
                    powerful kingdom of Elam itself. The struggle lasted through the reigns of four
                    Assyrian kings, Sargon, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assur-bani-pal, and the
                    overthrow of Elam was eventually effected only by the help of internal discord
                    and civil war. In 710, Sutπιk-nankhundi was driven from Yatbur and Rasi, on the
                    Babylonian frontier, and his Babylonian ally Merodach-baladan left to his fate.
                    In 704 the Elamites and Babylonians were defeated at Cis by Sennacherib, and in
                    the following year the Cassi in the northeast were reduced to submission. In 697
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the fleet of Sennacherib pursued
                    Merodach-Baladan and his followers to Nagitu and Khilman, at the mouth of the
                    Eulaeus, where the Elamites had given them shelter; the emigrants and their
                    Susian allies were scattered, and the towns burned. Meanwhile, Cudur-nankhundi,
                    the Elamite monarch, had marched into Babylonia; he was driven back, however, by
                    Sennacherib, 34 of his cities were destroyed, and he himself fled from Madaktu
                    to Khaidala. Three months after he died, and his brother and successor,
                    Urnman-minan, at once began to collect allies from all sides, and to prepare for
                    resistance. The terrible defeat at Khalule in 692, however, broke the power of
                    Elam, and made Babylonia an Assyrian province. Uιnmau-aldas I. remained on
                    friendly terms with Esarhaddon, but his murder by his two brothers, Urtaki and
                    Teumman, caused the war-party to recover its ascendency, and Urtaki made an
                    unsuccessful raid into Babylonia. On his death, his brother Teumman succeeded,
                    in virtue of the law by which the crown passed to the brother and not to the
                    sons of the deceased monarch, and almost immediately provoked a quarrel with
                    Assur-bani-pal by demanding the surrender of his nephews, who had taken refuge
                    at the Assyrian court. The Assyrians followed the Elamite army to Shushan, where
                    a battle was fought on the Eulaeus, in which the Elamites were defeated, Teumman
                    was captured and slain, and Umman-igas, the son of Urtaki, made king, his
                    younger brother Tammaritu being assigned the district of Khidalu. Umman-igas
                    afterwards assisted in the revolt of Babylonia, but Tammaritu raised a rebellion
                    against him, defeated him in battle, cut ofl his head, and seized the crown.
                    Tammaritu marched to Babylonia; while there, his officer Indabigas, made himself
                    king at Shushan, and drove Tammaritu to the coast, where he fled to
                    Assur-bani-pal. Indabigas was himself defeated and killed by a new pretender,
                    Umman-aldas IL, who was opposed, however, by three other rivals, two of whom
                    maintained themselves in the mountains until the Assyrian conquest of the
                    country, when Tammaritu was first restored and then imprisoned, Elam being
                    wasted with fire an&lt;l sword. The return of Umman-aldas led to a fresh
                    Assyrian invasion; the Elamite king fled from Madaktu to Dur-undasi, Shushan and
                    other cities were taken, and the Elamites utterly routed on the banks of the
                    Itite. The whole country was reduced to a desert, Shushan was plundered and
                    razed to the ground, 32 statues of its kings “of silver, gold, bronze, and
                    alabaster” being carried off, and Susiana was nfade an Assyrian province in 640
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The language of the Hebrew prophets seems to
                    imply that Elam recovered its independence, but was again conquered by
                    Nebuchadrezzar; on the fall of the Babyloniali empire it passed to Persia, the
                    Susian king Abradatas, mentioned in Xenophon’s romance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyropoedia</hi> (vi.), being probably unhistorical. Darius formed it into a
                    satrapy, with a tribute of 300 talents (Hdt. iii. 91). Shushan or Susa was
                    rebuilt, and became the capital of the empire. Twice at least, however, the
                    Susianians attempted to revolt in the early part of the reign of Darius, under
                    Assina or Atrines, the son of Uιnbadara, andMartiya, the son of Issainsakrà, who
                    called himself Immanes; but they gradually came to be completely Aryanized, and
                    their old agglutinative dialects were in course of time supplanted by the Aryan
                    Persian from the southeast.</p>
                <p>Among the Elamite divinities may be mentioned Lagamar or Lagamal, and Armannu,
                    the secret title of Sus⅛ak, “the god of Shushan,” who was believed to go every
                    year to Dilvun. His oracle stood just outside the city, and his image was held
                    too sacred to be seen by the eyes of a mortal.</p>
