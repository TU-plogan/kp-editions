                <p><label type="entry">EDWARD III</label>. (1312-1377), king of England, the eldest
                    son of Edward II. and of Isabella, was born at Windsor, November 13, 1312. He
                    was appointed guardian of the kingdom October 2G, 132G, and received the crown
                    February 1, 1327. On the 24th January 1328 he was married to Philippa, daughter
                    of the count of Hainault. During his minority the government of the kingdom was
                    intrusted to a body of guardians with Henry of Lancaster at their head, but was
                    virtually usurped by Roger Mortimer, until the king, irritated by his arrogance,
                    caused him to be <pb break="no"

                    and conveyed to the Tower. He was executed at Tyburn on the 29th November. It is
                    said to have been chiefly through Mortimer’s influence that, on the 24th April
                    1328, a peace was concluded between England and Scotland, the chief provisions
                    of which were that the Scots agreed to pay England the sum of .£20,000, and that
                    Edward agreed definitely to recognize the independence of the Scotch crown. The
                    treaty was very unpopular in England, and it is not surprising, therefore, that,
                    when Edward Baliol in 1332 made his attempt to mount the Scotch throne, Edward
                    III. gave him indirect assistance, and that after Baliol’s dethronement in 1333
                    an invasion of Scotland was resolved on. On July 19 Edward defeated the Scots at
                    the battle of Halidon Hill, and receiving as the result of his victory the
                    submission of the principal Scotch nobles, he annexed the whole of Scotland
                    south of the Forth to his own crown, and allowed Baliol to reign over the
                    remainder as titular king. Soon after, Baliol was again a fugitive, but was
                    again aided by Edward to mount a nominal throne. After a short period of peace
                    Edward in July 1336 ravaged and burned Scotland as far as Aberdeen, but growing
                    complications with France compelled him in the same year to return to England.
                    Though he professed to have a claim, through his mother, on the French throne
                    against Philip of Valois, that claim was left in abeyance until several acts of
                    aggression on the part of Philip brought about a rupture between the two kings.
                    The count of Flanders, at Philip’s instigation, had broken off commercial
                    relations with England; French privateers were daily committing ravages on
                    English commerce; Aquitaine was continually threatened by desultory attacks; and
                    Philip, though he hesitated to accept the responsibility of being the first to
                    declare war, scarcely attempted to conceal his endeavours to throw that
                    responsibility on Edward. Edward sailed for Flanders July 16, 1338, and at
                    Coblentz held a conference with the emperor Louis V., at which the latter
                    appointed him his vicar-general, and gave orders for all the princes of the Low
                    Countries to follow him in war for the space of seven years. In 1339 Edward laid
                    siege to Cambrai, but soon afterwards raised the siege and invaded France.
                    Philip advanced to meet him, but declined battle, and Edward concluded his first
                    campaign without achieving anything to compensate him for its cost. In 1340 he
                    defeated the French fleet before Sluys, and after landing in France laid siege
                    to Tournai, but before he succeeded in capturing it he was induced through money
                    difficulties to conclude a truce of nine months with France. In 1342 a truce for
                    two years was concluded between England and Scotland, and at the end of the same
                    year Edward again set out on an expedition against France, but at the
                    intercession of the Pope he agreed to a truce. Shortly after his return to
                    England a great tournament was held by him at Windsor in memory of King Arthur.
                    In 1346 he set sail on the expedition which resulted in the great victory of
                    Crécy and the capture of Calais; and in 1348 he again concluded a truce with
                    France. This year and the following are darkly memorable in English annals from
                    the outbreak of the “black death,” which spread terror and desolation throughout
                    the whole country, but on account of the reduction it made in the population,
                    was the ultimate cause of the abolition of serfdom and villanage in England.
                    From this time Edward as a warrior retires somewhat into the background, his
                    place being taken by the prince of Wales (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward the
                    Black Prince),</hi> who in 1356 won the battle of Poitiers, and took King John
                    prisoner. In 1359 Edward again invaded France, and in 1360 he signed the peace
                    of Bretigny, according to which the French agreed to pay for King John a ransom
                    of three million crowns, and Edward renounced his title to the throne of France,
                    but retained his full sovereignty over the whole of the ancient duchy of
                    Aquitaine, the counties of Ponthieu and Guignes, and the town of Calais. Peace
                    was again broken in 1369 by Charles of France, and when he concluded a truce
                    with England in 1375 all of France that remained in Edward’s hands was Bayonne
                    and Bordeaux in the south, and Calais in the north. The last years of Edward’s
                    reign form a sad and gloomy close to a career which had had a vigorous and
                    energetic commencement, and had afterwards been rendered illustrious by great
                    achievements. His empire in France was virtually overthrown; the vast
                    expenditure which had had such a fruitless result was sorely burdening his
                    subjects, and awakening increasing discontent; and he himself, through the
                    gradual decay of his mental faculties, had become a mere tool in the hands of
                    Alice Perrers and of ministers whose only aim was their own aggrandizement. In
                    1367 the “Good Parliament” virtually seized the helm of the state from the hands
                    of the king and his ministers. It compelled Alice Perrers to swear never to
                    return to the king’s presence, suspended the ministers Latimer and Lyons,
                    protested against the means then adopted for raising taxes, and demanded a
                    vigorous prosecution of the war. The Black Prince was the chief agent in urging
                    these reforms, but his death, in the midst of the Parliament’s deliberations,
                    for a time rendered almost abortive the good work he had begun. Edward died 21st
                    June 1377. The splendour of his reign belongs properly rather to the people than
                    to the monarch. Both in his home and foreign relations he showed considerable
                    prudence and sagacity, and he may be allowed the merit of having endeavoured as
                    much as possible to keep on good terms with his subjects; but under him the
                    progress of constitutional reform was due either to his money difficulties or to
                    events entirely beyond his control. Although endowed with high courage and
                    daring, there is no proof that he possessed more than average ability as a
                    general. His expeditions were planned on a scale of great magnificence, but he
                    entered on his campaigns without any definite aim, and his splendid victories
                    were mere isolated achievements, won partly by good fortune, but chiefly by the
                    valour of Welsh and Irish yeomen and the skill of English archers.</p>
