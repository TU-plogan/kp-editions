                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Laracπe</hi></label>, a town of Morocco en the Atlantic
                    coast, about 45 miles S. of Tangier, is picturesquely situated on a rocky height
                    to the south of the embouchure of the Wady Loukhus or Lixus. It is the seat of a
                    military governor, and has a number of well-kept though practically useless
                    defences. The impress of Spanish occupation is still evident, and all the main
                    points described in the 17th century by Pidon de Saint Olon can easily be
                    distinguished—such as the church, the fort of St Jacques, the castle of St
                    Etienne with its four cupolas, the Jew’s Tower, and the castle of Notre Dame
                    d’Europe, now the Kasba or citadel. The market-place is surrounded with arcades
                    of monolithic sandstone pillars. In spite of the bar at the entrance of the
                    river preventing the passage of all vessels of more than 150 tons, the port is
                    one of the most frequented on that part of the coast. The exports, gradually
                    increasing in value, consist mainly of millet, drà, and other cereals,
                    canary-seed, beans, pease, cork, and wool. In 1875, 136 vessels entered and
                    cleared, 26 being British and 58 Spanish. The population of the town at the same
                    date was estimated at 5000, of whom nearly 4000 were Mahometans, about 1000
                    Spanish-speaking Jews, and 60 Christians.</p>
                <p>Though the name of El-Araish is comparatively modern, and is mentioned neither by
                    El-Bikri nor by Edrisi, it seems not improbable from a passage in Scylax that
                    the site of the town was occupied by a Libyan settlement at an early date; and
                    about 3⅛ miles up the river there still exist on the hill of Tchemmish very
                    considerable ruins of the Punico-Roman city of Lixus. The modern town was
                    finally taken from the Portuguese in 1689 by Mulei Ismael after a five months’
                    siege; in 1785 it was attacked by the French, and in 1829 saw the destruction of
                    the Morocco fleet by the Austrians. A convent in connection with the Spanish
                    mission was maintained till 1822.</p>

                <p>1. I il LASTICITY of matter is that property in virtue of</p>
                <p>J_J which a body requires force to change its bulk or shape, and requires a
                    continued application of the force to maintain the change, and springs back when
                    the force is removed, and, if left at rest without the force, does not remain at
                    rest except in its previous bulk and shape. The elasticity is said to be perfect
                    when the body always requires the same force to keep it at rest in the same bulk
                    and shape and at the same temperature through whatever variations of bulk,
                    shape, and temperature it be brought. A body is said to possess some degree of
                    elasticity if it requires any force to keep it in any particular bulk or shape.
                    It is convenient to discuss elasticity of bulk and elasticity of shape sometimes
                    separately and sometimes jointly.</p>
                <p>2. Every body has some degree of elasticity of bulk. If a body possesses any
                    degree of elasticity of shape it is called a solid; if it possesses no degree of
                    elasticity of shape it is called a fluid.</p>
                <p>3. All fluids possess elasticity of bulk to perfection. Probably so do all
                    homogeneous solids, such as crystals and glasses. It is not probable that any
                    degree of fluid pressure (or pressure acting equally in all directions) on a
                    piece of common glass, or rock crystal, or of diamond, or on a crystal of
                    bismuth, or of copper, or of lead, or of silver, would make it denser after the
                    pressure is removed, or put it into a condition in which at any particular
                    intermediate pressure it would be denser than it was at that pressure before the
                    application of the extreme pressure. Malleable metals and alloys, on the other
                    hand, may have their densities considerably increased and diminished by
                    hammering and by mere traction. By compression between the dies used iu coining,
                    the density of gold may be raised from 19 ’ 258 to 19 <hi rend="superscript">
                    φ</hi> 367, and the density of copper from 8 ’ 535 to 8’916;<note

                    and Mr M'Farlane's experiments quoted below (section 78), show a piece of copper
                    wire decreasing in density from 8 ’ 91 to 8 ’ 835 after successive simple
                    tractions, by which its length was increased from 287 centimetres to 317
                    centimetres, while its modulus of rigidity decreased from 443 to 426 million
                    grammes per square centimetre. Later experiments, recently made for this article
                    by the same experimenter, have shown <hi rend="italic">augmentation</hi> of
                    density from 8 ’ 85 to 8 ’ 95, produced by successive tractions which elongated
                    a piece of copper wire from weighing 16 ’ 4 grammes per metre to weighing 13 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 grammes per metre, the wire having been first
                    annealed by heating it to redness in sand, and allowing it to cool slowly.
                    Augmentation of density by traction is a somewhat surprising result, but not
                    altogether so when we consider that the wire had been reduced to an abnormally
                    small density by the previous thermal treatment (the “annealing”). The common
                    explanation of these changes of density in metals, which attributes them to
                    porosity, is probably true; by porosity being understood a porous structure with
                    such vast numbers of the ultimate molecules in the portions of the solid
                    substance between pores or interstices that these portions may be called
                    homogeneous in the sense that a crystal or a liquid can be called homogeneous
                    (compare section 40 below).</p>

                <p>4. The elasticity of shape of many solids is not perfect: it is not known whether
                    it is perfect for any. It might be expected to ba perfect for glass and rock
                    crystal and diamond and other hard, brittle, homogeneous substances; but
                    experiment proves that at all events for glass it is not so, and shows on the
                    contrary a notable degree of imperfection in the torsional elasticity of glass
                    fibres. It might be expected that in copper and soft iron and other plastic
                    metals the elasticity of shape would be very imperfect; experiment shows, on the
                    contrary, that in copper, brass, soft iron, steel, platinum, provided the
                    distortion does not exceed a certain limit in each case, elasticity of shape is
                    remarkably perfect, much more perfect than in glass. It is quite probable that
                    even in the softer metals—zinc, tin, lead, cadmium, potassium, sodium,
                    &amp;c.—the elasticity of shape may be as perfect as in the metals mentioned
                    above, but within narrower limits as to degree of distortion. Accurate
                    experiment is utterly wanting, to discover what is the degree of imperfection,
                    if any, of the elasticity of any metal or alloy, when tested within sufficiently
                    narrow limits of distortion.</p>
                <p>5. The “viscosity of metals” described below (sections 21- 25) does not
                    demonstrate any imperfectness of elasticity according to the definition of
                    section 1, which is purely statical. The viscosity of solids <hi rend="italic"
                    >may</hi> (for all we yet know by experiment) depend, as does the viscosity of
                    fluids, upon a resistance varying with the velocity of the change, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vanishing when the velocity of the change is zero,</hi> that is to
                    say, when the body is at rest in any configuration; if so, the elasticity of the
                    substance concerned is perfect within the limits of the experiment in question.
                    If, on the other hand (as the discovery of elastic fatigue described below seems
                    to indicate may be to some degree the case), the loss of energy from the
                    vibrations in the experiments described is due to a dependence of the elastic
                    resilient force upon previous conditions of the substance in respect to strain,
                    the “viscosity” would be continuous with a true imperfectness of static
                    elasticity. Here, then, we have a definite question which can be answered by
                    experiment only :—Consider a certain definite stress applied to a solid
                    substance; as, for example, a certain “couple” twisting a wire or rod; or a
                    certain weight pulling it out, or compressing it lengthwise; or a certain weight
                    placed on the middle of a beam supported by trestles under its ends. Let it be
                    applied and removed a great many times, and suppose it to be seen that after
                    each application and removal of the stress the body comes to rest in exactly the
                    same configuration as after the previous application or removal of the stress.
                    If now the body be left to itself with the stress removed, and if it be found to
                    remain at rest in the same configuration for minutes, or hours, or days, or
                    years after the removal of the stres3, a part of the definition of perfect
                    elasticity is fulfilled. Or, again, if the stress be applied, and kept applied
                    with absolute constancy, and if the body remain permanently in a constant
                    configuration, another item of the definition of perfect elasticity is proved.
                    When any such experiment is made on any metal, unless some of the softer metals
                    (section 4) is to be excepted, there is certainly very little <hi rend="italic"
                    >if any</hi> change of configuration in the circumstances now supposed. The
                    writer believes, indeed, that nothing of the kind has hitherto been discovered
                    by experiment, provided the stress has been considerably less than that which
                    would break or give a notable permanent twist, or elongation, or bend, to the
                    body, that is to say, provided the action has been kept decidedly within the
                    limits of the body’s elasticity as commonly understood (sections 7-20). Mr J. T.
                    Bottomley, with the assistance of a grant of money from thθ British Association,
                    has commenced making arrangements for secular experiments on the elasticity of
                    metals, in the tower of the university of Glasgow, to answer this question in
                    respect to permanence or non-permanence through minutes, or hours, or days, or
                    years, or centuries. If several gold wires are hung side by side, one of them
                    bearing the smallest weight that will keep it approximately straight, another
                    wire - <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi

                    σ</hi> of the breaking weight, and so on; the one of them bearing ⅜4 of the
                    breaking weight will probably, in the course of a few hours or days, show very
                    sensible elongation. Will it go on becoming longer and longer till it breaks, or
                    will the time-curve of its elongation be asymptotic? Even with considerably less
                    than ∙j-⅜ of the breaking weight there will probably be a continually augmenting
                    elongation, but with asymptotic time-curve indicating a limit beyond which the
                    elongation never goes, but which it infinitely nearly reaches in an infinite
                    time. It is not probable that a gold wire stretched by <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of its present
                    breaking weight, or by £ of its present breaking weight, or even by ⅜ of its
                    present breaking weight, would break in a thousand or in a million years. The
                    existence of gold ornaments which have been fouud in ancient tombs and cities,
                    and have preserved their shapes for thousands of years without running down
                    glacier-wise (as does brittle pitch or sealing-wax in the course of a few years
                    in moderately warm climates), seems to prove that for gold (and therefore leaves
                    no doubt also for many other metals) the time-curve is asymptotic, if indeed
                    there is any slow change of shape at all after the application of a moderate
                    stress well within the limits of elasticity. Egyptian and Greek statues,
                    Etruscan vases, Egyptian obelisks, and other stone monuments with their engraved
                    hieroglyphics, flint implements and boulders, and mountains with the geological
                    evidence we have of their antiquity, prove for stones, and pottery, and rocks of
                    various kinds, a permanence for thousands and millions of years of resistance to
                    distorting stress.</p>
                <p>6. The complete fulfilment of the definition of perfect elasticity is not proved
                    by mere permanence of the extreme configurations assumed by the substance when a
                    stated amount of the stress is alternately applied and removed. This condition
                    might be fulfilled, and yet the amount of elastic force might be different with
                    the same palpable configuration of the body during gradual augmentation and
                    during gradual diminution of the stress. That it is so in fact is proved by the
                    discovery of viscosity referred to below; but it is not yet proved that if,
                    after increasing the stress to a certain definite amount, the body is brought to
                    rest in the same palpable configuration as before, the amounts of stress
                    required to hold it in this configuration are different in the two cases. If
                    they are (section 1) the elasticity is imperfect; if they are not the elasticity
                    is perfect within the limits of the experiment (compare section 36 below).</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="smallcaps">Limits of Elasticity—</hi><hi rend="italic">Elasticity of
                    Shape.—</hi> The degree of distortion within which elasticity of shape is found
                    is essentially limited in every solid. Within sufficiently narrow limits of
                    distortion every solid shows elasticity of shape to some degree—some solids to
                    perfection, so far as we know at present. When the distortion is too great, the
                    body either breaks or receives a permanent bend (that is, such a molecular
                    disturbance that it does not return to its original figure when the bending
                    force is removed). If the first notable dereliction from perfectness of
                    elasticity is a breakage, the body is called brittle,—if a permanent bend,
                    plastic or malleable or ductile. The metals are generally ductile; some metals
                    and metallic alloys and compounds of metals with small proportions of other
                    substances, are brittle; some of them brittle only in certain states of temper,
                    others it seems essentially brittle. The steel of before the days of Bessemer
                    and Siemens is a remarkable instance. When slowly cooled from a bright <pb

                    When heated to redness and cooled suddenly by being plunged in oil or water or
                    mercury, it becomes exceedingly brittle and hard (glass-hard, as it is called),
                    and to ordinary observation seems incapable of taking a permanent bend (though
                    probably careful observation would prove it not quite so). The definition of

                    but smaller than which no degree of pressure, however great, can condense it, is
                    a question which cannot be answered in the present state of science. Would any
                    pressure, however tremendous, give to gold a density greater than 19*6, or to
                    copper a density greater than 9Ό, after the pressure is removed (section 3
                    above)? But whether the body be fluid or a continuous non-porous solid, it
                    probably recovers the same density, however tremendously it may have been
                    pressed, and probably shows perfect elasticity of bulk (section 3 above) through
                    the whole range of positive pressure from zero to infinity, provided the
                    pressure has been equal in all directions like fluid pressure. As for negative
                    pressure, we have no knowledge of what limit, if any, there may be to the amount
                    of force which can be applied to a body pulling its surface out equally in all
                    directions. The question of how to apply the negative pressure is inextricably
                    involved with that of the body’s power to resist, The upper part of the mercury
                    of a barometer adhering to the glass above the level corresponding to the
                    atmospheric pressure is a familiar example of what is called negative pressure
                    in liquids. Water and other transparent liquids show similar phenomena, another
                    of which is the warming of water above its boiling point in an open glass or
                    metal vessel varnished w ith shellac. Attempts to produce great degrees of this
                    so-called negative pressure are baffled by what seems an instability of the
                    equilibrium which supervenes wflιen the negative pressure is too much augmented.
                    It is a very interesting subject for experimental inquiry to find how high
                    mercury or water or any other liquid can be got to stand above the level
                    corresponding to the atmospheric pressure in a tall hermetically sealed tube,
                    and how many degrees a liquid can, with all precautions, be warmed above its
                    boiling point. In each case ib⅛eems to be by a minute bubble forming and
                    expanding somewhere at the boundary of the liquid, where it is in contact with
                    the containing vessel, that the possible range of the negative pressure is
                    limited, judging from what we see when we carefully examine a transparent
                    liquid, or the surface of separation between mercury and glass, in any such
                    experiment. The contrast of the amounts of negative pressure practically
                    obtainable or obtained hitherto in such experiments on liquids (which are at the
                    most those corresponding to the weight of a few metres of the substance), with
                    that obtainable in the case of even the weakest solids, is remarkable; and as
                    for the strongest, consider for instance (sec. 22 below) 17 nautical miles of
                    steel pianoforte wire hanging by one end. When a cord, or rod, or ware of any
                    solid substance hangs vertically, the negative pressure (for example, 23,000
                    atmospheres in the case just cited) in any transverse section is equal to the
                    weight of the part hanging below it. It is an interesting question not to be
                    answered by any experiment easily made or even devised,—How much would the
                    longitudinal pull which can be applied to a cord, rod, or wire without breaking
                    it be augmented (probably augmented, but possibly diminished) by lateral pull
                    applied all round the sides so as to give equal negative pressure in all
                    directions?</p>

                <p>The limits of elasticity in the cases of these four examples are subjects of
                    vital importance in practical mechanics, and a vast amount of careful and
                    accurate observation and experiment, which has given much valuable practical
                    information regarding them, has been gone through by engineers, in their
                    necessary dealings with questions regarding strength of materials. Still there
                    is great want of definite scientific information on the subject of limits of
                    elasticity generally, and particularly on many elementary questions (section 21
                    below), which force themselves upon us when we endeavour to analyze the
                    molecular actions concerned in such cases as the four examples now before us.
                    Some principles of much importance for guidance in practical as well as
                    theoretical deductions from observations and experiments on this subject were
                    set forth twenty-nine years ago by Professor James Thomson, in an article
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical

                <p>10. “My principal object in the following paper is to show that the absolute
                    strength of any material composed of a substance possessing ductility (and few
                    substances, if any, are entirely devoid of this property) may vary to a great
                    extent, according to the state of tension or relaxation in which the particles
                    have been made to exist when the material as a whole is subject to no external
                    strain.</p>
                <p>11. “Let, for instance, a round bar of malleable iron, or a piece of iron wire,
                    be made red hot, and then be allowed to cool. I ta <pb break="no"

                    completely relaxed. Let, next, one end of the bar be fixed, and the other be
                    made to revolve by torsion, till the particles at the circumference of the bar
                    are strained to the utmost extent of which they can admit, without undergoing a
                    permanent alteration in their mutual connexion.<note anchored="true"

                    original relative positions when the disturbing force is removed. The opposite
                    conclusion, to which Mr Hodgkinson seems to have been led by some interesting
                    experimental results, will be considered at a more advanced part of this
                    paper.”</p></note> In this condition, equal elements of the cross section or the
                    bar afford resistances proportional to the distances of the elements from the
                    centre of the bar; since the particles are displaced from their positions of
                    relaxation through spaces which are proportional to the distances of the
                    particles from the centre. The couple which the bar now resists, and which is
                    equal to the sum of the couples due to the resistances of all the elements of
                    the section, is that which is commonly assumed as the measure of the torsional
                    strength of the bar. For future reference, this couple may be denoted by L, and
                    the angle through which it has twisted the loose end of the bar by Θ.</p>
                <p>12. “The twisting of the bar may, however, be carried still farther, and during
                    the progress of this process the outer particles will yield in virtue of their
                    ductility, those towards the interior successively reaching their elastic
                    limits, until, when the twisting has been sufficiently continued, all the
                    particles in the section, except those quite close to the centre, have been
                    strained beyond their elastic limits. Hence, if we suppose<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">[Note added October</hi>
                    1877.] This supposition may be true for some solids; it is certainly not true
                    for solids generally. A piece of copper or of iron taken in a soft and
                    unstrained condition certainly becomes “harder” when strained beyond its first
                    limits of elasticity, that is to say, its limits of elasticity become wider; and
                    a similar result will probably be found in ductile metals generally. Thus the
                    resistance of the outer elements will be greater than those of tire inner
                    elements in the case described in the text, until the torsion has been pushed so
                    far as to bring about the greatest hardness in all the elements at any
                    considerable distance from the axis. It may be that before this condition has
                    been attained the hardening of the outer elements will have been overdone, and
                    they m ιy have tegun to lose strength, and to have become friable and fissured.
                    The principle set forth in the text is not, however, vitiated by the
                    Incorrectness of a supposition introduced merely for the sake of numerical
                    illustration.</p></note> that no change in the hardness of the substance
                    composing the material has resulted from the sliding of its particles past one
                    another, and that therefore all small elements of the section of the bar afford
                    the same resistance, no matter what their distances from the centre may be, it
                    is easy to prove that the total torsional resistance of the bar is ⅛ of what it
                    was in the former case; or, according to the notation already adopted, it

                    a position of equilibrium, in which the outer particles will be strained in the
                    direction opposite to that in which it was twisted, and the inner ones in the

                    produced among the particles of the bar balancing one another. It is easy to
                    show that the line of separation between the particles strained in one direction
                    and those in the other is a circle whose radius is I of the radius of the bar.

                    the circumference will have suffered the utmost distortion of which they can
                    admit without undergoing permanent alteration. Now, it is easy to prove that the
                    couple required to produce a certain angle of torsion is the same in the new
                    state of the bar as in the old.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“To prove this, let tl,e bar be supposed to be divided into
                    an infinite number of elementary concentric tubes (like the so-called annual
                    rings of growth in trees). To twist each of these tubes through a certain angle,
                    the same couple will·be required, whether the tube is alreadysubject to the
                    action of a couple of any moderate amount in either direction or not. Hence, to
                    twist them all, or, what is the same thing, to twist the whole bar, through a
                    certain angle, the same couple will be required whether the various elementary
                    tubes be or be not relaxed, when the bar as a whole is free from external
                    strain.”</p></note> Hence the ultimate strength of the bar when twisted
                    backwards is represented by a couple amounting to only ⅞ L. But, as we have
                    seen, it is ⅜ L when the wire is twisted forwards. That is, then, <hi
                    rend="italic">The wire in its new state has twice as much strength to resist
                    torsion in one direction as it has to resist it the other.</hi></p>
                <p>14 “Principles quite similar to the foregoing, are applicable in regard to beams
                    subjected to cross strain. As, however, my chief object at present is to point
                    out the existence of such principles, to indicate the mode in which they are to
                    be applied, and to show their great practical importance in the determination of
                    the strength of materials, I need not enter fully into their application in the
                    case of cross strain. The investigation in this case closely resembles that in
                    the case of torsion, but is more complicated on account of the different
                    ultimate resistances afforded by any material to tension and to compression, and
                    on account of the numerous varieties in the form of section of beams which for
                    different purposes it is found advisable to adopt. I shall therefore merely make
                    a few remarks on this subject.</p>
                <p>15. “If a bent bar of wrought iron or other ductile material be straightened, its
                    particleswill thus be put into such a state that its strength to resist cross
                    strain, in the direction towards which it has been straightened, will be veιy
                    much greater than its strength to resist it in the opposite direction, each of
                    these two resistances being entirely different from that which the same bar
                    would afford were its particles all relaxed when the entire bar is free from
                    external strain. The actual ratios of these various resistances depend on the
                    comparative ultimate resistances afforded by the substance to compression and
                    extension, and also, in a very material degree, on the form of the section of
                    the bar. I may, however, state that in general the variations in the strength of
                    a bar to resist cross strain, which are occasioned by variations in its
                    molecular arrangement, are much greater even than those which have already been
                    pointed out as occurring in the strength of bars subjected to torsion.</p>
                <p>16. “What has already been stated is quite sufficient to account for many very
                    discordant and perplexing results which have been arrived at by different
                    experimenters on the strength of materials. It scarcely ever occurs that a
                    material is presented to us, either for experiment or for application to a
                    practical use, in which the particles are free from great mutual strains.
                    Processes have already been pointed out by which we may at pleasure produce
                    certain peculiar strains of this kind. These, or other processes producing
                    somewhat similar strains, are used in the manufacture of almost all materials.
                    Thus, for instance, when malleable iron has received its final conformation by
                    the process termed <hi rend="italic">cold swaging,</hi> that is, by hammering it
                    till it is cold, the outer particles exist in a state of extreme compression,
                    and the internal ones in a state of extreme tension. The same seems to be the
                    case in cast iron when it is taken from the mould in which it has been cast. The
                    outer portions have cooled first, and have therefore contracted, while the inner
                    ones still continued expanded by heat. The inner ones then contract as they
                    subsequently cool, and thus they, as it were, pull the outer ones together. That
                    is, in the end the outer ones are in a state of compression and the inner ones
                    in the opposite condition.</p>

                    been previously supposed, a strain, however small in comparison to that which
                    would occasion rupture, was sufficient to produce a <hi rend="italic">set,</hi>
                    or permanent change of form, in the beams on which he experimented. Now this is
                    just what should be expected in accordance with the principles which I have
                    brought forward; for if, for some of the causes already pointed out, various
                    !&gt;arts of a beam previously to the application of an external force ιave been
                    strained to the utmost, when, by the application of such force, however small,
                    they are still farther displaced from their positions of relaxation, they must
                    necessarily undergo a permanent alteration in their connexion with one another,
                    an alteration permitted by the ductility of the material; or, in other words,
                    the beam as a whole must take a set.</p>
                <p>18. “In accordance with this explanation of the fact observed by Mr Hodgkinson, I
                    do not think we are to conclude with him that ‘the maxim of loading bodies
                    within the elastic limit has no foundation in nature.’ It appears to me that the
                    defect of elasticity, which he has shown to occur even with very slight strains,
                    exists only when the strain is applied for the first time; or, in other words,
                    that if a beam has already been subjected to a considerable strain, it may again
                    be subjected to any smaller strain in the same direction without its taking a
                    set. It will readily be seen, however, from Mr Hodgkinson’s experiments, that
                    the term ‘ elastic limit,’ as commonly employed, is entirely vague, and must
                    tend to lead to erroneous results.</p>
                <p>19. “The considerations adduced seem to me to show clearly that there really
                    exist <hi rend="italic">two elastic limits</hi> for any material, between which
                    the displacements or deflexions, or what may in general be termed the changes of
                    form, must be confined, if we wish to avoid giving the material a set, or, in
                    the case of variable strains, if we wish to avoid giving it a continuous
                    succession of sets which would gradually bring about its destruction; that these
                    two elastic limits are usually situated one on the one side and the other on the
                    opposite side of the position which the material assumes when subject to no
                    external strain, though they may be both on the same side of this position of
                    relaxation;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>" Thus if
                    the section of a beam be of some such form as that shown in either of the
                    accompanying figures, the one rib or the tw·o ribs, as the case may be, being
                    very weak in comparison to the thick part of the beam, it may readily occur that
                    the two elastic limits of deflexion may be situated both on the same side of the
                    position assumed by the beam when free from external force. For if the beam has
                    been supported at its extremities and loaded at its middle till the rib A B lias
                    yielded by its ductility so as to make all its particles exert their utmost
                    tension, and if the load be now gradually removed, the particles at B may come
                    to be compressed to the utmost before the load has been entirely
                    removed.”</p></note> and that they may therefore with propriety be called the
                    <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">inferior limit</hi> of
                    the change of form of the material for the particular arrangement which has been

                    >fixed</hi> for any given material, but that, if the change of form be continued
                    beyond either limit, two new limits will, by means of an alteration in the
                    arrangement of the particles of the material, be f;iven to it in place of those
                    which it previously possessed; and astly, that the· processes employed in the
                    manufacture of materials are usually such as to place the two limits in close
                    contiguity with one another, thus causing the material to take in the first
                    instance a set from any strain, however slight, while the interval which may
                    afterwards exist between the two limits, alιd also, as was before stated, the
                    actual position assumed by each of them are determined by the peculiar strains
                    which are subsequently applied to the material.</p>
                <p>20. “The introduction of new, though necessary, elements into the consideration
                    of the strength of materials may, on the one hand, seem annoying from rendering
                    the investigations more complicated. On the other hand, their introduction will
                    really have the effect of obviating difficulties, by removing erroneous modes of
                    viewing the subject, and preventing contradictory or incongruous results from
                    being obtained by theory and experiment. In all investigations, in fact, in
                    which we desire to attain or to approach nearly to truth, we must take facts as
                    they actually are, not as we might be tempted to wish them to be for enabling us
                    to dispense with examining processes which are somewhat concealed and intricate
                    but are not the less influential from their hidden character.”</p>
                <p>21. Passing now to homogeneous matter (sec. 38), homogeneously strained (chap.
                    ii. of Math. Theory below), we are met by physical questions of great interest
                    regarding limits of elasticity. Supposing the solid to be homogeneously
                    distorted in any particular way to nearly the limit of its elasticity for this
                    kind of distortion, will the limits be widened or narrowed by the superposition
                    of negative or positive pressure equal in all directions producing a dilatation
                    or a condensation? It seems probable that a dilatation would narrow the limits
                    of elasticity, and a condensation widen them. This, however, is a mere guess:
                    experiment alone can answer the question. Take again a somewhat less simple
                    case. A wire is stretched by a weight to nearly its limits of longitudinal
                    elasticity; a couple twisting it is applied to its lower end—Will this either
                    cause the weight to run down and give the wire a permanent set, or break it?
                    Probably,—yes; but experiment only can decide. The corresponding question with
                    reference to a column loaded with a weight <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have the
                    same answer, but not necessarily so. Experiment again is wanting. A wire hanging
                    stretched by a light weight, merely to steady it, is twisted to nearly its limit
                    of torsional elasticity by a couple of given magnitude applied to its lower end
                    ∙ the stretching weight is increased—Will this cause it to yield to the couple
                    and take a permanent set? Probably,— yes. [Certainly <hi rend="italic">yes,</hi>
                    for steel piano-forte wire experimented on by Mr M <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> Farlane to answer this question since it was first put in type fur the
                    present article.] If so, then the limits of torsional elasticity of a wire
                    bearing a heavy weight are widened by diminishing or taking off the weight; and
                    no doubt it will follow continuously that a column twisted by opposing couples
                    at its two ends will have its limits of torsional elasticity widened by tho
                    application of forces to its two ends, pressing them towards one another.
                    Experiments to answer these questions would certainly reward the experimenter
                    with definite and interesting results.</p>

                    rend="italic">Solids.—</hi> The limit of elasticity of metals, stones, crystals,
                    woods, are so narrow that the distance between any two neighbouring points of
                    the substance never alters by more than a small proportion of its own amount
                    without the substance either breaking or experiencing a permanent set, and
                    therefore the angle between two lines meeting in any point of the substance and
                    passing always through the same matter is never altered by more than a small
                    fraction of the radian,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    experiment, for any substance except cork, india-rubber, jellies, are those of
                    steel pianoforte wire. Take, for example, the piano-forte wire at present in use
                    for deep-sea soundings. It is No. 22 of the Birmingham wire gauge, its density
                    is 7 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 727, it weighs 0 ’ 34 gramme per centimetre,
                    or G ’ 298 kilogrammes per nautical mile of 1852 ’ 3 metres, and therefore its
                    sectional area and diameter are Ό044 square centimetre and Ό244 centimetre. It
                    bears a weight of 106 kilogrammes, which is equal in weight to about 31
                    kilometres of its length, and when this weight is alternately hung on and
                    removed the length of the wire varies by ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> ⅛ of its
                    amount. While this elongation takes place there is a lateral shrinking, as we
                    shall see (section 47), of from ∣ to -j⅜∙ of the same amount.</p>
                <p>23. Consider now in the unstrained wire two lines through the substance of the
                    wire at right angles to one another in any plane through or parallel to the axis
                    of the wire in directions equally inclined to this line. When the wire is pulled
                    lengthwise the two vertical angles bisected by the length of the wire become
                    acute, and the other two obtuse by a small difference, as illustrated in the
                    diagram (fig. 2), <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0824-0801"/> where the continuous lines represent a portion of
                    the unpulled wire, and the dotted lines the same portion of the wire when
                    pulled. The change m each of the angles would be - <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi>
                    ⅛- of the radian in virtue of the elongation were there no lateral shrinking,
                    and about <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> ⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of the
                    radian in virtue of the lateral shrinking were there no elongation. Thewhole
                    change experienced by each of the right angles is therefore actually (section
                    37) κV ÷ τ⅜σ&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> or a</hi> bout ∙ <hi rend="subscript">
                    δ</hi> ⅛ of the radian, or 0* ’ 84. This is an extreme case. In all other cases
                    of metals, stones, glasses, crystals, the substance either breaks or takes a
                    permanent bend, probably before it experiences any so great angular distortion
                    as a degree; and except in the case of steel we may roughly regard the limits of
                    elasticity as being something between <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> θ⅛θ <hi

                <p>24. On the other hand, gelatinous substances, such as india-rubber and elastic
                    jellies, have very wide limits of elasticity. A vulcanized india-rubber band,
                    for instance, is capable of being stretched, again and again, to eight times its
                    length, and returning always to nearly its previous condition when the stress is
                    removed. A shape of transparent jelly presents a beautiful instance of great
                    degrees of distortion with seemingly very perfect elasticity. All these
                    instances, india-rubber and jellies, show with great changes of shape but slight
                    changes of bulk. They have, in fact, all, as nearly as experiment has hitherto
                    been able to determine, the same compressibility as water.</p>
                <p>25. Cork, another body with very wide limits of elasticity (very imperfect
                    elasticity it is true) is singular, among bodies seemingly homogeneous to the
                    eye, in its remarkably easy compressibility. It is, in fact, the only seemingly
                    homogeneous solid which shows to the unaided eye any sensible change of bulk
                    under any practically applicable forces. A small homogeneous piece torn out of a
                    cork may, by merely pressing it between the fingers, be readily compressed to
                    half its bulk, and a large slab of cork in a Bramah press may be compressed to

                    presents a very interesting appearance in an Oersted glass compressing vessel;
                    first floating, and when compressed to 20 or 30 atmospheres sinking, and
                    shrivelling in bulk very curiously; then on the pressure being removed,
                    expanding again, but not quite to previous bulk, and floating up or remaining
                    down according to the amount of its load.</p>
                <p>The divergencies presented by cork and gelatinous bodies in opposite directions
                    from the regular elasticity of hard solids form an interesting subject, to which

                    of elasticity so far as regards the magnitude of the positive pressure applied
                    or conceivably applicable; but in respect to the magnitude of negative pressure,
                    and in respect to the magnitude of the change of bulk, whether by negative or
                    positive pressure, there are probably very decided and not very wide limits.

                    <hi rend="italic">proportionate</hi> condensation, gases present enormously
                    wider limits of elasticity than any liquids or solids,—in fact no limit in
                    respect to dilatation, and in respect to condensation adefinite limit only when
                    the gas is below Andrews’s “critical temperature.” If the gas be kept at any
                    temperature above that critical temperature, it remains homogeneous, however
                    much it be condensed; and therefore for a fluid above the critical temperature
                    there is, in respect to magnitude of pressure, no superior limit to its
                    elasticity. On the other hand, if a fluid be kept at any constant temperature
                    less than its critical temperature, it remains homogeneous, and presents an
                    increasing pressure until a certain density is reached; when its bulk is further
                    diminished it divides into two parts of less and greater density (the part of
                    less density being called vapour, that of greater density being called liquid,
                    if it is not solid) and presents no further increase of pressure until the
                    vaporous part shrinks to nothing, and the whole becomes liquid (that is to say,
                    homo geneous fluid at the greater of the two densities) or else becomes
                    solid—the question whether the more dense part is liquid or solid depending on
                    the particular temperature below the critical temperature at which the whole
                    substance is kept during the supposed experiment.</p>
                <p>28. The thermo-dynamic reasoning of Professor James Thomson, which showed the
                    effect of change of pressure in altering the freezing point of a liquid, leads
                    to analogous considerations regarding the effect of continuous increase or
                    continuous decrease of pressure upon a mass consisting of the same substance
                    partly in the liquid and partly in the solid state at one temperature. The three
                    cases of transition from gas to liquid, from gas to solid, and from liquid to
                    solid, present us with perfectly definite limits of elasticity, —the only
                    perfectly definite limits of elasticity in nature of which we have any certain
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>29. <hi rend="italic">Viscosity of Fluids and Solids.—</hi> Closely connected
                    with limits of elasticity, and with imperfectness of elasticity, is viscosity,
                    that is to say, resistance to change of shape depending on the velocity of the
                    change. The full discovery of the viscosity of liquids and gases is due
                    originally to Stokes; and his hypothesis that in fluids the force of resistance
                    is in simple proportion to the velocity of change of shape has been subsequently
                    confirmed by the experimental investigations of Helmholtz, Maxwell, Meyer,
                    Kundt, and Warburg. The definition of a fluid given in section 2 above may, by
                    section 1, be transformed into the following:—A fluid is a body which requires
                    no force to keep it in any particular shape, or—A fluid is a body which
                    exercises no permanent resistance to a change of shape. The resistance to a
                    change of shape presented by a fluid, evanescent as it is when the shape is not
                    being changed (or vanishing when the velocity of the change vanishes), is
                    essentially different from that permanent resistance to change of shape, the
                    manifestation of which in solids constitutes elasticity of shape as defined in
                    section 1. Maxwell’s admirable kiretic theory of the viscosity of gases points
                    to a full explanation of viscosity, whether of gases, liquids, or solids, in the
                    consideration of configurations and arrangements of relative motions of
                    molecules, permanent in a solid under distorting stress, and temporary in fluids
                    or solids while the shape is being changed, in <pb break="no"

                    solid, and viscous resistance to change of shape in the non-quiescent fluid or

                    Experimental exercises performed by students in the physical laboratory of the
                    university of Glasgow, during the session 1864-65, brought to light some very
                    remarkable and interesting results, proving a loss of energy in elastic
                    vibrators (sometimes as much as two or three per cent, of energy lost in the
                    course of a single vibration in one direction) incomparably greater than
                    anything that could be due to imperfections in their elasticity (section 1), and
                    showing also a very remarkable fatigue of elasticity, according to which a wire
                    which had been kept vibrating for several hours or days through a certain range
                    came to rest much quicker when left to itself than when set in vibration after
                    it had been at rest for several days and then immediately left to itself. Thus
                    it was found that the rates of subsidence of the vibrations of the several wires
                    experimented on were generally much less rapid on the Monday mornings, when they
                    had been at rest since the previous Friday, than on other days of the week, or
                    than after several series of experiments had been made on a Monday. The
                    following statement (sections 31-34) is extracted from a short article by W.
                    Thomson, in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</hi> for May
                    18, 1865, containing some of the results of these observations.</p>
                <p>31. “<hi rend="italic">Viscosity.—</hi> By induction from a great variety of
                    observed phenomena, we are compelled to conclude that no change of volume or of
                    shape can be produced in any kind of matter without dissipation of energy. Even
                    in dealing with the <hi rend="italic">absolutely perfect</hi> elasticity of
                    volume presented by every fluid, and possibly by some solids, as for instance
                    homogeneous crystals, dissipation of energy is an inevitable result of every
                    change of volume, because of the accompanying change of temperature, and
                    consequent dissipation of heat by conduction or radiation. The same cause gives
                    rise necessarily to some degree of dissipation in connection with every change
                    of shape of an elastic solid. But estimates founded on the thermodynamic theory
                    of elastic solids, which I have given elsewhere,<note anchored="true"

                    have sufficed to prove that the loss of energy due to this cause is small in
                    comparison with the whole loss of energy observed in many cases of vibration. I
                    have also found, by vibrating a spring alternately in air of ordinary pressure
                    and in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, that there is an internal
                    resistance to its motions immensely greater than the resistance of the air. The
                    same conclusion is to be drawn from the observation made by Kupffer in his great
                    work on the elasticity of metals, that his vibrating springs subsided much more
                    rapidly in their vibrations than rigid pendulums supported on knife-edges. The
                    subsidence of vibrations is probably more rapid in glass than in some of the
                    most elastic metals, as copper, iron, silver, aluminium;<note anchored="true"

                    Hence there is in elastic solids a <hi rend="italic">molecular friction</hi>
                    which may be properly called <hi rend="italic">viscosity of solids,</hi>
                    because, as being an internal resistance to change of shape depending on the
                    rapidity of the change, it must be classed with fluid molecular friction, which
                    by general consent is called <hi rend="italic">viscosity of fluids.</hi> But, at
                    the same time, it ought to be remarked that the word viscosity, as used hitherto
                    by the best writers, when solids or heterogeneous semi-solid semifluid masses
                    are referred to, has not been distinctly applied to molecular friction,
                    especially not to the molecular friction of a highly elastic solid within its
                    limits of high elasticity, but has rather been employed to designate a property
                    of slow continual yielding through very great, or altogether unlimited, extent
                    of change of shape, under the action of continued stress. It is. in this sense
                    that Forbes, for instance, has used the word in stating that ‘ viscous theory of
                    glacial motion,’ which he demonstrated by his grand observations on glaciers.
                    As, however, he and many other writers after him have used the words plasticity
                    and plastic, both with reference to homogeneous solids (such as wax or pitch
                    even though also brittle, soft metals, &amp;c.) and to heterogeneous semi-solid
                    semi-fluid masses (as mud, moist earth, mortar, glacial ice, &amp;c.), to
                    designate the property common to all those cases of experiencing, under
                    continued stress, either quite continued and unlimited change of shape, or
                    gradually very great change at a diminishing (asymptotic) rate through infinite
                    time, and as the use of the term <hi rend="italic">plasticity</hi> implies no
                    more than does <hi rend="italic">viscosity</hi> any physical theory or
                    explanation of the property, the word viscosity is without inconvenience left
                    available for the definition I propose.</p>
                <p>33. “To investigate the viscosity of metals, I have in the first place taken them
                    in the form of round wires, and have chosen torsional vibrations, after the
                    manner of Coulomb, for observation, as being much the easiest way to arrive at
                    definite results. In every case one end of the wire was attached to a rigid
                    vibrator with sufficient firmness (thorough and smooth soldering I find to be
                    always the best plan when the wire is thick enough); and the other to a fixed
                    rigid body, from which the wire hangs, bearing the vibrator at its lower end. I
                    arranged sets of observations to be made for the separate comparison of the
                    following cases :—</p>
                <p>(a) “The same wire with different vibrators of equal weights to give equal

                    or of recurring changes of shape through a wider range).</p>

                    it to be, in fluid friction, approximately as the rapidity of the change of
                    shape. The irregularities in the results of the experiments which up to this
                    time I have made seem to prove that much smaller vibrations (producing less
                    absolute amounts of distortion in the parts of the wires most stressed) must be
                    observed before any simple law of relation between molecular friction and
                    velocity can be discovered.</p>
                <p>(δ) “When the weight was increased, the viscosity was always at first much
                    increased; but then day after day it gradually diminished and became as small in

                    to continue the experiments long enough in any case to find the limit to this

                <p>35. The investigation was continued with much smaller degrees of maximum angular
                    distortion, to discover, if possible, the law of the molecular friction, the
                    existence of which was demonstrated by these experiments. Two questions
                    immediately occurred :—What is the law of subsidence of range in any single
                    series of oscillations, the vibrator being undisturbed by external force? and
                    (question (a) of § 33 above) what is the relation between the law of subsidence
                    in two sets of oscillations having different periods, with the same elastic body
                    in the same circumstances of elastic force, as for instance the same or similar
                    metallic wires with equal weights hung upon them, performing torsional
                    oscillations in different times on account of the moments of inertia of the
                    suspended masses being different?</p>
                <p>36. So far as the irregularities depending on previous conditions of the elastic
                    substance allowed any simple law to be indicated, the experimental answer to the
                    first question for degrees of angular distortion much smaller than the palpable
                    limits of elasticity was the <hi rend="smallcaps">Compound Interest Law,</hi>
                    that is to say,— <hi rend="italic">The diminutions of range per equal intervals
                    of time or per equal numbers of oscillations bore a constant proportion to the
                    diminishing range;</hi> or, <hi rend="italic">The differences of the logarithms
                    of the ranges were proportional to the intervals of time.</hi></p>
                <p>The only approach to an answer to the second question yet obtained is that the
                    proportionate losses of amplitude in the different cases are not such as they
                    would be if the molecular resistance were simply proportional to the velocity of
                    change of shape in the different cases. If the molecular friction followed this
                    simple law, the proportionate diminutions of range per period would be directly
                    as the square roots of the periods, or per equal intervals of time they would be
                    inversely as the square roots of the periods. Instead of the proportion being
                    so, the loss was greater with the longer periods than that calculated according
                    to the law of square roots from its amount in the shorter periods. It was in
                    fact as it would be if the result were wholly or partially due to imperfect
                    elasticity, or “elastische Nach-wirkung” — elastic after-working — as the
                    Germans call it (compare section 6 above). To form a rough idea of the results,
                    irrespectively of the ultimate molecular theory (which is to be looked for in
                    the proper extension of Maxwell’s kinetic theory of viscosity of gases),
                    consider a perfectly elastic vesicular solid, whether like a sponge with
                    communications between the vesicles, or with each vesicle separately inclosed in
                    elastic solid: imagine its pores and interstices filled up with a viscous fluid,
                    such as oil. Static experiments on such a solid will show perfect elasticity of
                    bulk and shape; kinetic experiments will show losses of energy such as are
                    really shown by vibrators of india-rubber, jelly, glass, metals, or other
                    elastic homogeneous solids, but more regular, and following more closely the
                    compound interest law for single series and the law of relation to square roots
                    of periods stated above for sets of oscillations in different periods. In short,
                    according to Stokes’s law of viscosity of fluids, our supposed vesicular
                    vibrator would follow the law of subsidence of a simple vibrator experiencing a
                    resistance simply proportional to the velocity of its motion, while no such
                    simple law is applicable to the effects of the internal molecular resistance in
                    a vibrating elastic solid.</p>
                <p>37. <hi rend="italic">Hooke's Law.—</hi> A law expressed by Hooke with Latin

                    force. In English, then, Hooke’s law is that elongation (understood of an
                    elastic solid) is proportional to the force producing it. It is, of course, to
                    be extended continuously from elongation to contraction in respect to the
                    effect, and from pull to push in respect <pb break="no"

                    founded prove a perfect continuity from a pulling force to a smaller force in
                    the same direction, and from the less force to zero, and from zero of pulling
                    force to different degrees of push or positive pressure, or negative pull.
                    Experimental proof merely of the <hi rend="italic">continuity of the phenomena
                    through zero of force</hi> suffices to show that, for <hi rend="italic"
                    >infinitely small</hi> positive or negative pulls, positive or negative
                    elongation is simply proportional to the positive or negative pull; or, in other
                    words, positive or negative contraction is proportional to the positive or
                    negative pressure producing it. But now must be invoked minutely accurate
                    experimental measurement to find how nearly the law of simple proportionality
                    holds through finite ranges of contraction and elongation. The answer happily
                    for mathematicians and engineers is <hi rend="italic">that Hooke's law is
                    fulfilled, as accurately as any experiments hitherto made can tell,</hi> for all

                    few hundredths of the radian (or not more than about two or three degrees). The
                    same law holds for the condensation of liquids up to the highest pressures under

                <p>Boyle’s law of the “spring of air <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> shows that the
                    augmentation of density of a gas is simply proportional to the augmentation of
                    the pressure, through the very wide ranges of pressure through which that law is
                    approximately enough fulfilled. Hence the infinitesimal diminution of volume
                    produced by a given infinitesimal augmentation of pressure varies as the square
                    of the volume, and the <hi rend="italic">proportionate</hi> diminution of volume
                    (that is to say, the ratio of the diminution of volume to the volume) is
                    proportional to the volume, or inversely proportional to the density. Andrews’s
                    experiments on the compressibility of a fluid, such as carbonic acid, at
                    temperatures slightly above the critical temperature, and of the gas and of
                    liquids at temperatures slightly below the critical temperature, are intensely
                    interesting, not merely in respect to the <hi rend="italic">natural history</hi>
                    of elasticity, but as opening vistas into the philosophy of molecular
                    action.</p>
                <p>We cannot expect to find any law of simple proportionality between stress and
                    change of dimensions, or proportionate change of dimensions, in the case of any
                    elastic or semi-elastic “soft” solids, such as cork on one hand or india-rubber
                    or jellies on the other, when strained to large angular distortions, or to large
                    proportionate changes of dimensions. The exceedingly imperfect elasticity of all
                    these solids, and the want of definiteness of the substance of many of them,
                    renders accurate experimenting unavailable for obtaining any very definite or
                    consistent numerical results; but it is interesting to observe roughly the
                    forces required to produce some of the great strains of which they are capable
                    without any total break down of elastic quality; for instance, to hang weights
                    successively on an indiarubber band and measure the elongations. This any one
                    may readily do, and may be surprised to find the enormous increase of resistance
                    to elongation presented by the attenuated band before it breaks.</p>
                <p>38. <hi rend="italic">Homogeneousness defined.—</hi> A body is called homogeneous
                    when any two equal, similar parts of it, with corresponding lines parallel and
                    turned towards the same parts, are un distinguishable from one another by any
                    difference in quality. The perfect fulfilment of this condition, without any
                    limit as to the smallness of the parts, though conceivable, is not generally
                    regarded as probable, for any of the real solids or fluids known to us, however
                    seemingly homogeneous. It is held by all naturalists that there is a <hi

                    >compound</hi> bodies such as water, ice, rock-crystal, &amp;c., the constituent
                    substances lie side, by side, or arranged in groups of finite dimensions, and
                    even in bodies called <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> (that is those not known to
                    be chemically resolvable into other substances) there is no ultimate
                    homogeneousness. In other words, the prevailing belief is that every kind of
                    matter with which we are acquainted has a more or less <hi rend="italic"
                    >coarse-grained</hi> texture, whether (as great masses of solid brick-work or
                    stone-building, or as natural sandstone or granite rocks) having visible
                    molecules, or (as seemingly homogeneous metals, or continuous crystals, or
                    liquids, or gases) having molecules too small to be directly visible, or
                    measurable but not <hi rend="italic">undiscoverably</hi> small,—really, it is to
                    be believed, of dimensions to be accurately determined in future advances of
                    science. Practically the definition of <hi rend="italic">homogeneousness</hi>
                    may be applied on a very large scale to masses of building or coarse-grained
                    conglomerate rock, or on a more moderate scale to blocks of common sandstone, or

                    Or (as a crystal which exhibits <hi rend="italic">dichroism)</hi> it may be

                    conduct heat equally in all directions. Still, as a rule, a homogeneous

                    to the elongation or contraction. In this definition the definite article is
                    clearly misapplied. There are, as we have seen, two moduluses of elasticity for
                    an isotropic solid,—one measuring elasticity of bulk, the other measuring
                    elasticity of shape. An interesting and instructive illustration of the
                    confusion of ideas so often rising in physical science from faulty logic is to
                    be found in “An Account of an Experiment on the Elasticity of Ice: By Benjamin
                    Bevan, Esq.,, in a letter to Dr Thomas Young, Foreign Sec. R. S.” and in Young’s
                    “Note” upon it, both published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                    Royal Society</hi> for 1826. Bevan gives an interesting account of a
                    well-designed and well-executed experiment on the flexure of a bar, 3^97 inches
                    thick, 10 inches broad, and 100 inches long, of ice on a pond near Leighton
                    Buzzard (the bar remaining attached by one end to the rest of the ice, but being
                    cut free by a saw along its sides and across its other end), by which he
                    obtained a fairly accurate determination of “the modulus of ice ”;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The result is given in the
                    Table of Moduluses, sec. 77, below.</p></note> and says that he repeated the
                    experiment in various ways on ice bars of various dimensions, some remaining
                    attached by one end, others completely detached, and found results agreeing with
                    the first as nearly “as the admeasurement of the thickness could be
                    ascertained.” He then proceeds to compare “the modulus of ice” which he had thus
                    found with “the modulus of water,” which he quotes from Young’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures</hi> as deduced from Canton’s experiments on the
                    compressibility of water. Young in his “Note” does <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    point out that the two moduluses were essentially different, and that <hi

                    the flexure of a bar, is essentially zero for every fluid. We now call “Young’s
                    modulus” the particular modulus of elasticity defined as above by Young, and so
                    avoid all confusion.</p>

                    isotropic solid is the amount of tangential stress divided by the deformation it

                    proposition, also easily proved, is as follows: A strain compounded of a simple
                    <hi rend="italic">extension</hi> in one set of parallels, and a simple
                    contraction of equal amount in any other set perpendicular to those, is the same
                    as a simple shear in either of the two sets of planes cutting the two sets of
                    parallels at 45°, and the numerical measuring of this shear or simple distortion

                    stress may be thus applied to any one cube, and for different cubes taken from
                    any different positions in the solid. Hence the elastic quality of a perfectly
                    elastic, homogeneous, isotropic solid is fully defined by two elements,—its
                    resistance to distortion and its resistance to compression. The first has been
                    already considered (section 43). The second is measured by the amount of uniform
                    pressure in all directions per unit area of its surface required to produce a
                    stated very small compression. The numerical reckoning of the first is the
                    compressing pressure divided by the diminution of the bulk of a portion of the
                    substance which, when uncompressed, occupies the unit volume. It is sometimes

                    would require the rigidity to be ⅜ of the resistance to compression, for all

                    enormous discrepancies from it in many well-known bodies, and rendering it most
                    improbable that there is any approach to a constancy of ratio between rigidity
                    and resistance to compression in any class of solids. Thus clear elastic jellies
                    and india-rubber present familiar specimens of isotropic homogeneous solids
                    which, while differing very much from one another in rigidity (“stiffness ”),
                    are probably all of very nearly the same compressibility as water, which is
                    about per atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Their resistance to compression, measured by the reciprocal of this, is obviously
                    many hundred times the absolute amount of the rigidity of the stiffest of those
                    substances. A column of any of them, therefore, when pressed together or pulled
                    out, within its limits of elasticity, by balancing forces applied to its ends
                    (or an india-rubber band when pulled out), experiences no sensible change of
                    volume, though very sensible change of length. Hence the proportionate extension
                    or contraction of any transverse diameter must be sensibly equal to half the
                    longitudinal contraction or extension; and such substances may be practically
                    regarded as incompressible elastic solids in interpreting all the phenomena for
                    which they are most remarkable. Stokes gave reasons for believing that metals
                    also have in general greater resistance to compression, in proportion to their
                    rigidities, than according to the fallacious theory, although for them the
                    discrepancy is very much less than for the gelatinous bodies. This probable
                    conclusion was soon experimentally demonstrated by Wertheim, who found the ratio
                    of lateral to longitudinal change of lineal dimensions, in columns acted on
                    solely by longitudinal force, to be about ⅜ for glass and brass; and by
                    Kirchhoff, who, by a well-devised experimental method, found <hi

                    iron). But it is scarcely possible to hold a piece of cork in the hand without
                    perceiving the fallaciousness of this last attempt to maintain a theory which
                    never had any good foundation. By careful measurements on columns of cork of
                    various forms (among them, cylindrical pieces cut in the ordinary way for
                    bottles), before and after compressing them longitudinally in a Bramah’s press,
                    we have found that the change of lateral dimensions is insensible both with
                    small longitudinal contractions and return dilatations, within the limits of
                    elasticity, and with such enormous longitudinal contractions as to ⅜ or ∣ of the
                    original length. It is thus proved decisively that cork is much more rigid,
                    while metals, glass, and gelatinous bodies are all less rigid, in proportion to
                    resistance to compression, than the supposed “perfect solid”; and the practical
                    invalidity of the theory is experimentally demonstrated. By obvious mechanism of
                    jointed bars a solid may be designed which shall swell laterally when pulled,
                    and shrink laterally when compressed, in one direction, and which shall be
                    homogeneous in the same sense (article 40) as crystals and liquids are called
                    homogeneous.</p>
                <p>49. <hi rend="italic">Modulus of Simple Longitudinal Strain.—</hi> In sections
                    45, 46, we examined the effect of a simple longitudinal stress in producing
                    elongation in its own direction, and contraction in lines perpendicular to it.
                    With stresses substituted for strains, and strains for stresses, we may apply
                    the same process to investigate the longitudinal and lateral tractions required
                    to produce a simple longitudinal strain (that is, an elongation in one
                    direction, with no change of dimensions perpendicular to it) in a rod or solid
                    of any shape.</p>
                <p>Thus a simple longitudinal strain <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is equivalent to a
                    cubic dilatation <hi rend="italic">e</hi> without change of figure (or linear
                    dilatation ∣e equal in all directions), and two distortions consisting each of
                    dilatation ⅜e in the given direction and contraction ⅜e in each of two
                    directions perpendicular to it and to one another. To produce the cubic
                    dilatation <hi rend="italic">e</hi> alone requires (section 44) a normal
                    traction <hi rend="italic">ke</hi> equal in all directions. And, to produce
                    either of the distortions simply, since the measure (section 43) of each is <hi
                    rend="italic">⅛e,</hi> requires a distorting stress equal to <hi rend="italic">n
                    ×</hi> ⅜e, which consists of tangential tractions each equal to this amount,
                    positive (or drawing outwards) in the line of the given elongation, and negative
                    (or pressing inwards) in the perpendicular direction. Thus we have in all normal
                    traction <hi rend="italic">∙=(k + jη)e,</hi> in the direction of the given )
                    strain, and f , ,&gt; normal traction == <hi rend="italic">(k</hi>- ∣n)β, in

                    reckoning moduluses in units of force per unit of area, it is sometimes
                    convenient to express them in terms of the weight of unit bulk of the solid. A
                    modulus thus reckoned, or, as it is called by some writers, the length of the

                    Experimenters hitherto have stated their results in terms in the gravitation
                    unit, each for his own locality,—the accuracy hitherto attained being scarcely
                    in any cases sufficient to require corrections for the different intensities of

                <p>The most useful and generally convenient specification of the modulus of
                    elasticity of a substance is in grammes-weight per square centimetre. This has
                    only to be divided by the specific gravity of the substance to give the <hi

                    unhappily sometimes used in practical and even in scientific statements, we too
                    often meet with reckonings of the modulus in pounds per square inch or per

                <p>The reckoning most commonly adopted in British treatises on mechanics and

                    social than to physical science, that a people tending naturally to be regulated
                    by common sense should voluntarily condemn themselves, as the British have so
                    long done, to unnecessary hard labour in every action of common business or
                    scientific work related to measurement, from which all the other nations of
                    Europe have emancipated themselves. Professor W. H. Miller, of Cambridge,
                    concludes, from a very trustworthy comparison of standards by Kupffer, of St
                    Petersburg, that the weight of a cubic decimetre of water at temperature of

                <p>52. “Resilience” is a very useful word, introduced about forty years ago (when
                    the <hi rend="italic">doctrine of energy</hi> was beginning to become
                    practically appreciated) by Lewis Gordon, first professor of engineering in the
                    university of Glasgow, to denote the quantity of work that a spring (or elastic
                    body) gives back when strained to,some stated limit and then allowed to return
                    to the condition in -which it rests when free from stress. The word “resilience”
                    used without special qualification may be understood as meaning <hi
                    rend="italic">extreme resilience,</hi> or the work given back by the spring
                    after being strained to the extreme limit within which it can be strained again
                    and again without breaking or taking a permanent set. In all cases for which
                    Hooke’s law of simple proportionality between stress and strain holds, the
                    resilience is obviously equal to the work done by a constant force of half the
                    amount of the extreme force acting through a space equal to the extreme
                    deflection.</p>
                <p>53. When force is reckoned in “gravitation measure,” resilience per unit of the
                    spring’s mass is simply the height that the spring itself, or an equal weight,
                    could be lifted against gravity by an amount of work equal to that given back by
                    the spring returning from the stressed condition.</p>
                <p>54. Let the elastic body be a long homogeneous cylinder or prism with flat ends
                    (a bar as we may call it for brevity), and let the stress for which its
                    resilience is reckoned be <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> normal pressures on
                    its ends. The resilience per unit mass is equal to the greatest height from
                    which the bar can fall with its length vertical, and impinge against a perfectly
                    hard horizontal plane without suffering stress beyond its limits of elasticity.
                    For in this case (as in the case of the direct impact of two equal and similar
                    bars meeting with equal and opposite velocities, discussed in Thomson and Tait’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Natural Philosophy,</hi> section 303), the kinetic energy of
                    the translational motion preceding the impact is, during the first half of the
                    collision, wholly converted into potential energy of elastic force, which during
                    the second half of the collision is wholly reconverted into kinetic energy of
                    translational motion in the reverse direction. During the whole time of the
                    collision the stopped end of the bar experiences a constant pressure, and at the
                    middle of the collision the whole substance of the bar is for an instant at rest
                    in the same state of compression as it would have permanently if in equilibrium
                    under the influence of that pressure and an equal and opposite pressure on the
                    other end. From the beginning to the middle of the collision the compression
                    advances at a uniform rate through the bar from the stopped end to the free end.
                    Every particle of the bar which the compression has not reached continues moving
                    uniformly with the velocity of the whole before the collision until the
                    compression reaches it, when it instantaneously comes to rest. The part of the
                    bar which at any instant is all that is compressed remains at rest till the
                    corresponding instant in the second half of the collision.</p>
                <p>55. From our preceding view of a bar impinging against an ideal perfectly rigid
                    plane, we see at once all that takes place in the real case of any rigorously
                    direct longitudinal collision between two equal and similar elastic bars with
                    flat ends. In this case the whole of the kinetic energy which the bodies had
                    before collision reappears as purely translational kinetic energy after
                    collision. The same would be approximately true of any two bars, provided the
                    times taken by a pulse of simple longitudinal stress to run through their
                    lengths are equal. Thus if the two bars be of the same substance, or of
                    different substances having the same value for Young’s modulus, the lengths must
                    be equal, but the diameters may be unequal. Or if the Young’s modulus be
                    different in the two bars, their lengths must (Math. Theory, chap, xvii.) be
                    inversely as the square roots of its values. To all such cases the laws of
                    “collision between two perfectly elastic bodies,” whether of equal or unequal
                    masses, as given in elementary dynamical treatises, are applicable. But in every
                    other case part of the translational energy which the bodies have before
                    collision is left in the shape of vibrations after collision, and the
                    translational energy after collision is accordingly less than before collision.
                    The losses of energy observed in common elementary dynamical experiments on
                    collision between solid globes of the same substance are partly due to this
                    cause. If they were wholly due to it they would be independent of the substance,
                    when two globes of the same substance are used. They would bear the same
                    proportion to the whole energy in every case of collision between two equal
                    globes, or again, in every case of collision between two globes of any stated
                    proportion of diameters, provided in each case the two which collide are of the
                    same substances; but the proportion of translational energy converted into
                    vibrations would not be the same for two equal globes as for two unequal globes.
                    Hence when differences of proportionate losses of energy are found in
                    experiments on different substances, as in Newton’s on globes of glass, iron, or
                    compressed wool, this must be due to imperfect elasticity of the material. It is
                    to be expected that careful experiments upon hard well-polished globes striking
                    one another with such gentle forces as not to produce even at the point of
                    contact any stress approaching to the limit of elasticity, will be found to give
                    results in which the observed loss of translational energy can be almost wholly
                    accounted for by vibrations remaining in the globes after collision.</p>

                    simple longitudinal pull, the extreme resilience of steel pianoforte wire of the
                    gauge and quality referred to in section 22 above (calculated by multiplying the
                    breaking weight into half the elongation produced by it according to the
                    experimental data of section 22) is 6066 metre-grammes (gravitation measure) per
                    ten metres of the wire. Or, whatever the length of the wire, its resilience is
                    equal to the work required to lift its weight through 179 metres.</p>

                    by gradations of weights up to the breaking weight, representing the results by
                    aid of a curve, and measuring its area to find the integral work given back by
                    the spring after being stretched by a weight just short of the breaking

                    flexure a bar or uniform rod or wire, straight when free from stress, is kept in
                    a circular form by equal opposing couples properly applied to its ends. The
                    parts of the bar on the convex side of the circle must obviously be stretched
                    longitudinally, and those on the concave side contracted longitudinally, by the
                    flexure. It is not obvious, however, what are the conditions affecting the
                    lateral shrinkings and swellings of ideal filaments into which we may imagine
                    the bar divided lengthwise. Earlier writers had assumed without proof that each
                    filament, bent as it is in its actual position in the bar, is elongated or
                    contracted by the same amount as it would be if it were detached, and subjected

                    lateral shrinking or swelling which the filament must really experience in the
                    bent bar. The subject first received satisfactory mathematical investigation

                    that the old supposition is substantially correct, with the important practical
                    exception of the flat spring referred to in section 59 below. His theory shows
                    that, in fact, if we imagine the whole rod divided parallel to its length into
                    infinitesimal filaments, each of these shrinks or swells laterally with sensibly
                    the same freedom as if it were separated from the rest of the substance and
                    subjected to end pull or end compression, lengthening or shortening it in a
                    straight line to the same extent as it is really lengthened or shortened in the
                    circular arc which it becomes in the bent rod. He illustrates the distortion of
                    the cross section by which these changes of lateral dimensions are necessarily
                    accompanied in the annexed diagram (fig. 5), in which either the whole normal
                    section of a rectangular beam, or a rectangular area in the normal section of a
                    beam of any figure, is represented in its strained and unstrained figures, with
                    the central point O common to the two. The flexure is in planes perpendicular to

                    parallel to them, of the unstrained rectangular area become concentric arcs of

                    would give rise to sensibly less and greater shortenings and stretchings in the
                    filaments towards the corners than those supposed in the ordinary calculation of
                    flexural rigidity (article 61), and so vitiate the result. Unhappily,
                    mathematicians have not hitherto succeeded in solving, possibly not even tried
                    to solve, the beautiful problem thus presented by the flexure of a broad very
                    thin band (such as a watch spring) into a circle of radius comparable with a

                    distortion of the normal section (illustrated in the diagram of article 57) does
                    not sensibly impede the free lateral contractions and expansions in the

                    required to give unit curvature in any plane to a rod or beam is called its
                    flexural rigidity for curvature in that plane. When the beam is of circular
                    cross section and of isotropic material, the flexural rigidity is clearly the
                    same, whatever be the plane of flexure through the axis, and the plane of the
                    bending couple coincides with the plane of flexure. It might be expected that in
                    a round bar of aeolotropic material, such as a wooden rod with the annual woody
                    layers sensibly plane and parallel to a plane through its axis, would show
                    different flexural rigidities in different planes,—in the case of wood, for
                    example, different according as the flexure is in a parallel or perpendicular to
                    the annual layers. This is not so, however; on the contrary, it is easy to show,
                    by an extension of St Venant’s theory, that in the case of the wooden rod the
                    flexural rigidity is equal in all planes through the axis, and that the plane of
                    flexure always agrees with the plane of the bending couple, and to prove

                    the same rule from its Young’s modulus, provided that the aeolotropy is not such
                    as (section 81) to give rise to alteration of the angle between the length and
                    any diameter perpendicular to the length when weight is hung on the rod, or on
                    any longitudinal filament cut from it. Excluding then all cases in which there
                    is any such oblique aeolotropy, we have a very simple theory for the flexure of
                    bars of any substance, whether isotropic or aeolotropic, and whether homogeneous
                    or not homogeneous through the cross section.</p>

                    Flexure of a Beam.—</hi> The flexural rigidity of a rod is generally not equal
                    in different directions, and the plane of flexure does not generally coincide
                    with the plane of the bending couple. Thus a flat ruler is much more easily bent
                    in a plane perpendicular to its breadth than in the plane of its breadth; and if
                    we apply opposing couples to its two ends in any plane through its axis not
                    either perpendicular or parallel to its breadth, it is obvious that the plane in
                    which the flexure takes place will be more inclined to the plane of the breadth
                    than to the plane of the bending couple. Very elementary statical theory,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0833-0810"/> Venant’s conclusions of section 57, shows that,
                    whatever the shape and the distribution of matter in the cross section of the
                    bar, there are two planes at right angles to one another such that if the bar be
                    bent in either of these planes the bending couple will coincide with the plane
                    of flexure. These planes are called principal planes of flexure, and the
                    rigidities of the bar for flexure in these planes are called its principal
                    flexural rigidities. When the principal flexural rigidities are known the
                    flexure of the bar in any plano oblique to the principal planes is readily found
                    by supposing it to be bent in one of the principal planes and simultaneously in
                    the other, and calculating separately the couples required to produce these two
                    component flexures. The positions of the principal planes of flexure, the
                    relative flexural rigidities, and the law of elongation and contraction in
                    different parts of the cross section, are found according to the following
                    simple rules :—</p>
                <p>(1.) Imagine an infinitely thin plane disc of the same shape and size as the
                    cross section loaded with matter in simple proportion to the Young’s modulus in
                    different parts of the cross section. Let the quantity of matter per unit area
                    on any point of the disc be equal to the Young’s modulus on the corresponding
                    point of the rod when the material is heterogeneous: on the other hand, when the
                    material is homogeneous it is more convenient to call the quantity of matter
                    unity per unit area of the disc. Considering different axes in the plane of the
                    disc through its centre of inertia, find the two principal axes of greatest and
                    least moments of inertia, and find the moments of inertia round them.</p>
                <p>(2.) In whatever plane the bar be bent it will experience neither elongation nor
                    contraction in the filament which passes through the centres of inertia of the
                    cross sections found according to rule</p>
                <p>(1) , nor ’ in the diameter of the cross section perpendicular to the plane of
                    flexure.</p>
                <p>(3. ) Thus all the particles which experience neither elongation nor contraction
                    lie in a surface cutting the plane oi flexure perpendiculari y through the
                    centres of inertia of the cross sections. All the material on the outside of
                    this cylindrical surface is elongated, and all on the interior is contracted, in
                    simple proportion to distance from it: the amount of the elongation or
                    contraction being in fact equal to distance from this neutral surface divided by
                    the radius of its curvature.</p>
                <p>(4. ) Hence it is obvious that the portions of the solid on the two sides of any
                    cross section must experience mutual normal force, pulling them towards one
                    another in the stretched part, and pressing them from one another in the
                    condensed part, and that the amount of this negative or positive normal pressure
                    per unit of area must be equal to the Young’s modulus at the place, multiplied
                    into the ratio of its distance from the neutral line of the cross section to the
                    radius of curvature.</p>
                <p>The sum of these positive and negative forces over the whole area of the cross
                    section is zero in virtue of condition</p>
                <p>(2) . Their couple resultant has its axis perpendicular to the plane of curvature
                    when this line is either of the principal axes (3) of the cross section; and its
                    moment is clearly equal to the moment of inertia of the material disc (1)
                    divided by the radius of curvature. Hence the principal flexural rigidities are
                    simply equal to the principal moments of inertia of this disc; and the principal
                    flexural planée are the planes through its principal axes and the length of the
                    bar; or taking the quantity of matter per unit area of the disc unity for the
                    case of a homogeneous bar, we have the rule that the principal rigidities are
                    equal to the product of the Young’s modulus into the principal moments of
                    inertia of the cross sectional areas, and the principal planes of flexure are
                    the longitudinal planes through the principal axes of this area.</p>

                    applications of the general equations of internal equilibrium of an elastic

                    practical value in engineering; and the reader is referred to Thomson and Tait’s

                <p>64. <hi rend="italic">Torsion Problem stated and Torsional Rigidity
                    defined.—</hi> To one end of a long, straight prismatic rod, wire, or solid or
                    hollow cylinder of any form, a given couple is applied in a plane perpendicular
                    to the length, while the other end is held fast: it is required to find the
                    degree of twist produced, and the distribution of strain and strese throughout
                    the prism. The amount of the twist per unit length divided by the moment of the
                    couple is called the torsional rigidity of the rod or prism. This definition is
                    founded simply on the extension of Hooke’s law to torsion discovered
                    experimentally by Coulomb, according to which a rod or wire when twisted within
                    limits of torsional elasticity exerts a reactive couple in simple proportion to
                    the angle through which one end is turned relatively to the other. The internal
                    conditions to be satisfied in the torsion problem are that the resultant action
                    between the substance on the two sides of any normal section is a couple, in the
                    normal plane, equal to the given couple. This problem has not hitherto been
                    attacked for aeolotropic solids. Even such a case as that of the round wooden
                    rod (section 61) with annual layers sensibly parallel to a plane through its
                    length, will, when twisted, experience a distribution of strain complicated much
                    by its aeolotropy. The following statements of results are confined to rods of
                    isotropic material.</p>
                <p>65. <hi rend="italic">Torsion of Circular Cylinder.—</hi> For a solid or hollow
                    circular cylinder, the solution (given first, we believe, by Coulomb) obviously
                    is that each circular normal section remains unchanged in its own dimensions,
                    figure, and internal arrangement (so that every straight line of its particles
                    remains a straight line of unchanged length), but is turned round the axis of
                    the cylinder through such an angle as to give a uniform <hi rend="italic">rate
                    of twist</hi> equal to the applied couple divided by the product of the moment
                    of inertia of the circular area (whether annular or complete to the centre) into
                    the modulus of rigidity of the substance.</p>
                <p>For, if we suppose the distribution of strain thus specified to be actually
                    produced, by whatever application of stress is necessary, we have, in every part
                    of the substance, a simple shear parallel to the normal section, and
                    perpendicular to the radius through it. The elastic reaction against this
                    requires, to balance it (section 43), a simple distorting stress consisting of
                    forces in the normal section, directed as the shear, and others in planes
                    through the axis, and directed parallel to the axis. The amount of the shear is,
                    for parts of the substance at distance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> from the axis,
                    equal obviously to <hi rend="italic">τr,</hi> if τ be the rate of twist reckoned
                    in radians per unit of length of the cylinder. Hence the amount of the
                    tangential force in either set of planes is nr per unit of area, if <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> be the rigidity of the substance. Hence there is no force
                    between parts of the substance lying on the two sides of any element of any
                    circular cylinder coaxal with the bounding cylinder or cylinders; and
                    consequently no force is required on the cylindrical boundary to maintain the
                    supposed state of strain. And the mutual action between the parts of the
                    substance on the two sides of any normal plane section consists of force in this
                    plane, directed perpendicular to the radius through each point, and amounting to
                    <hi rend="italic">nτr</hi> per unit of area. The moment of this distribution of
                    force round the axis of the cylinder is (if <hi rend="italic">dσ</hi> denote an
                    element of the area) <hi rend="italic">nτffdaT</hi><hi rend="italic

                    area round the perpendicular to its plane through its centre, which is therefore
                    equal to the moment of the couple applied at either end.</p>
                <p>66. <hi rend="italic">Prism of any shape constrained to a Simple Twist.—</hi>
                    Farther, it is easily proved that if a cylinder or prism of any shape be
                    compelled to take exactly the state of strain above specified (section 65) with
                    the line through the centres of inertia of the normal sections, taken instead of
                    the axis of the cylinder, the mutual action between the parts of it on the two
                    sides of any normal section will be a couple of which the moment will be
                    expressed by the same formula, that is, the product of the rigidity, into the
                    rate of twist, into the moment of inertia of the section round its centre of
                    inertia. But for any other shape of prism than a solid or symmetrical hollow
                    circular cylinder, the supposed state of strain requires, besides the terminal
                    opposed couples, force parallel to the length of the prism, distributed over the
                    prismatic boundary, in proportion to the distance PE along the tangent, from
                    each point of the surface, to the point in which this line is cut by a
                    perpendicular to it from O the centre of inertia of the normal section. To prove
                    this let a normal section of the prism be represented in the annexed diagram
                    (fig. 6). Let PK, representing the shear at any point P, close to the prismatic
                    boundary, be resolved into PN and PT along the normal and tangent respectively.
                    The whole, shear PK being equal to τr its component PN is equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">τr</hi> sin ω or <hi rend="smallcaps">t.PE.</hi> The corresponding
                    component of the required stress is <hi rend="italic">ητ.</hi> PE, and involves
                    equal forces in the plane of the diagram, and in the plane through TP
                    perpendicular to it, each amounting to <hi rend="italic">nr.</hi> PE per unit of
                    area.</p>
                <p>An application of force equal and opposite to the distribution thus found over
                    the prismatic boundary, would of course alone produce in the prism, otherwise
                    free, a state of strain which, compounded with that supposed above, would give
                    the state of strain actually produced by the sole application of balancing
                    couples to the two ends. The result, it is easily seen, consists of an increased
                    twist, together with a warping of naturally plane normal sections, by
                    infinitesimal displacements perpendicular to themselves, into certain surfaces
                    of anticlastic curvature, with equal opposite curvatures. In bringing forward
                    this theory, St Venant not only pointed out the falsity of the supposition
                    admitted by several previous writers, and used in practice fallaciously by
                    engineers, that Coulomb’s law holds for other forms of prism than the solid or
                    hollow circular cylinder, but he discovered fully the nature of the requisite
                    correction, reduced the determination of it to a problem of pure mathematics,
                    worked out the solution fora great variety of important and curious cases,
                    compared the results with observation in a manner satisfactory and interesting
                    to the naturalist, and gave conclusions of great value to the practical
                    engineer.</p>

                    plane area about an axis through its centre of inertia perpendicular to its
                    plane is obviously equal to the sum of its moments of inertia round any two axes
                    through the same point at right angles to one another in its plane, the
                    fallacious extension of Coulomb’s law, referred to in section 66, would make the
                    torsional rigidity of a bar of any section equal to the product of the ratio of
                    the modulus of rigidity to the Young’s modulus into the sum of its flexural
                    rigidities (section 61) in any two planes at right angles to one another through
                    its length. The true theory, as we have seen (section 67), always gives a
                    torsional rigidity less than this. How great the deficiency may be expected to
                    be in cases in which the figure of the section presents projecting angles, or
                    considerable prominences (which may be imagined from the hydrokinetic analogy
                    given in section 67), has been pointed out by M. de St Venant, with the
                    important practical application, that strengthening ribs, or projections (see,
                    for instance, the second of the annexed diagrams), such as are introduced in
                    engineering to give stiffness to beams, have the reverse of a good effect when
                    <hi rend="italic">torsional</hi> rigidity or strength is an object, although
                    they are truly of great value in increasing the flexural rigidity, and giving
                    strength to bear ordinary strains, which are always more or less flexural. With
                    remarkable ingenuity and mathematical skill he has drawn beautiful illustrations
                    of this important practical principle from his algebraic and transcendental
                    solutions.</p>
                <p>Thus, for an equilateral triangle, and for the rectilineal and three curvilineal
                    squares shown in the diagrams (fig. 12), he finds for the torsional rigidities
                    the values stated. The number immediately below the diagram indicates in each
                    case the fraction which the true torsional rigidity is of the old fallacious
                    estimate (section 66),—the latter being the product of the rigidity of the
                    substance into the moment of inertia of the cross section round an axis
                    perpendicular to its plane through its centre of inertia. The second number
                    indicates in each case the fraction which the torsional rigidity is of that of a
                    solid circular cylinder of the same sectional area.</p>

                    de St Venant also calls attention to a conclusion from his solutions which to
                    many may be startling, that in his simpler cases the places of greatest
                    distortion are those points of the boundary which are nearest to the axis of the
                    twisted prism in each case, and the places of least distortion those farthest
                    from it. Thus in the elliυtic cylinder the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0836-0813"/> substance is most strained at the ends of the
                    smaller principal diameter, and least at the ends of the greater. In the
                    equilateral triangular and square prisms there are longitudinal lines of maximum
                    strain through the middles of the sides. In the oblong rectangular prism there
                    are two lines of greater maximum strain through the middles of the broader pair
                    of sides, and two lines of less maximum strain through the middles of thenarrow
                    sides. The strain is, as we may judge from the hydrokinetic analogy, excessively
                    small, but not evanescent, in the projecting ribs of a prism of the figure shown
                    in (2) of section 69. It is quite evanescent infinitely near the angle, in the
                    triangular and rectangular prisms, and in each other case, as (5) of section 69,
                    in which there is a finite angle, whether acute . or obtuse, projecting
                    outwards. This reminds us of a general remark we have to make, although
                    consideration of space may oblige us to leave it without formal proof.</p>

                    isotropic or aeolotropic, bounded by any surfaces presenting projecting edges or
                    angles, or re-entrant angles or edges, however obtuse, cannot experience any
                    finite stress or strain in the neighbourhood of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >projecting</hi> angle (trihedral, polyhedral, or conical); in the neighbourhood
                    of an edge, can only experience simple longitudinal stress parallel to the
                    neighbouring part of the edge; and generally experiences infinite stress and
                    strain in the neighbourhood of a <hi rend="italic">re-entrant</hi> edge or
                    angle; when influenced by any distribution of force, exclusive of surface
                    tractions infinitely near the angles or edges in question. An important
                    application of the last part of this statement is the practical rule, well known
                    in mechanics, that every re-entering edge or angle ought to be rounded, to
                    prevent risk of rupture, in solid pieces designed to bear stress. An
                    illustration of these principles is afforded by the concluding example of
                    torsion in Thomson and Tait’s section 707; in which we have the complete
                    mathematical solution of the torsion problem for prisms of fan-shaped sections,
                    such as the annexed forms (fig. 13).</p>

                    than or greater than two right angles as in cases (4) and (6) respectively.</p>

                    produced whenever a solid is strained by opposing, and heat when it is strained
                    by yielding to, any elastic force of its own, the strength of which would
                    diminish if the temperature were raised; but that, on the contrary, heat is
                    produced when a solid is strained against, and cold when it is strained by
                    yielding to, any elastic force of its own, the strength of which would increase
                    if the temperature were raised. When the strain is a condensation or dilatation,
                    uniform in all directions, a fluid may be included in the statement. Hence the
                    following propositions :—</p>
                <p>(1.) A cubical compression of any elastic fluid, or solid in an ordinary
                    condition causes an evolution of heat; but, on the contrary, a cubical
                    compression produces cold in any substance, solid or fluid, in such an abnormal
                    state that it would contract if heated while kept under constant pressure. Water
                    below its temperature (3° ’ 9 Cent.) of maximum density is a familiar instance.
                    (See table of section 76.)</p>
                <p>(2.) If a wire already twisted be suddenly twisted further, always, however,
                    within its limits of elasticity, cold will be produced; and if it be allowed
                    suddenly to untwist, heat will be evolved from itself (besides heat generated
                    externally by any work allowed to be wasted, which it does in untwisting). It is
                    assumed that the torsional rigidity of the wire is diminished by an elevation of
                    temperature, as the writer of this article had found it to be for copper, iron,
                    platinum, and other metals (compare section 78).</p>
                <p>(3.) A spiral spring suddenly drawn out will become lower in temperature, and
                    will rise in temperature when suddenly allowed to draw in. [This result has been
                    experimentally verified by Joule (“Thermodynamic Properties of Solids,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc.,</hi> 1858) and the amount of the effect found to
                    agree with that calculated, according to the preceding thermodynamic theory,
                    from the amount of the weakening of the spring which he found by
                    experiment.]</p>
                <p>(4.) A bar or rod or wire of any substance with or with out a weight hung on it,
                    or experiencing any degree of end thrust, to begin with, becomes cooled if
                    suddenly elongated by end pull or by diminution of end thrust, and warmed if
                    suddenly shortened by end thrust or by diminution of end pull; except abnormal
                    cases in which with constant end pull or end thrust elevation of temperature
                    produces shortening; in every such case pull or diminished thrust produces
                    elevation of temperature, thrust or diminished pull lowering of temperature.</p>
                <p>(5.) An india-rubber band suddenly drawn out ç within its limits of elasticity)
                    becomes warmer; and when allowed to contract, it becomes colder. Any one may
                    easily verify this curious property by placing an india-rubber band in slight
                    contact with the edges of the lips, then suddenly extending it—it becomes very
                    perceptibly warmer: hold it for some time stretched nearly to breaking, and then
                    suddenly allow it to shrink—it becomes quite startingly colder, the cooling
                    effect being sensible not merely to the lips but to the fingers holding the
                    band. The first published statement of this curious observation is due to Gough
                    <hi rend="italic">(Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of
                    Manchester,</hi> 2d series, vol. i. p. 288), quoted by Joule in his paper on
                    “Thermodynamic Properties of Solids” <hi rend="italic">(Transactions of Royal
                    Society,</hi> 1858). The thermodynamic conclusion from it is that an
                    india-rubber band, stretched by a constant weight of sufficient amount hung on
                    it, must, when heated, pull up the weight, and, when cooled, allow the weight to
                    descend: this Gough, independently of thermodynamic theory, had found to be
                    actually the case. The experiment any one can make with the greatest ease by
                    hanging a few pounds weight on a common indiarubber band, and taking a red-hot
                    coal in a pair of tongs, or a red-hot poker, and moving it up and down close to
                    the band. The way in which the weight rises when the red-hot body is near, and
                    falls when it is removed, is quite startling. Joule experimented on the amount
                    of shrinking per degree of elevation of temperature, with different weights hung
                    on a band of vulcanized india-rubber, and found that they closely agreed with
                    the amounts calculated by Thomson’s theory from the heating effects of pull, and
                    cooling effects of ceasing to pull, which he had observed in the same piece of
                    india-rubber.</p>

                <p>But we have no knowledge of the effect of pressures of several thousand
                    atmospheres in altering the expansibility or specific heat in liquids, or in
                    fluids which at less heavy or at ordinary pressures are “gases.”</p>
                <p>75. When change of temperature, whether in a solid or a fluid is produced by the
                    application of a stress, the corresponding modulus of elasticity will be greater
                    in virtue of the change of temperature than what may be called the static
                    modulus defined as above, on the understanding that the temperature if changed
                    by the stress is brought back to its primitive degree before the measurement of
                    the strain is performed. The modulus calculated on the supposition that the
                    body, neither losing nor gaining heat during the application of the stress and
                    the measurement of its effect, retains the whole change of temperature due to
                    the stress, will be called for want of a better name the kinetic modulus,
                    because it is this which must (as in Laplace’s celebrated correction of Newton’s
                    calculation of the velocity of sound) be used in reckoning the elastic forces
                    concerned in waves and vibrations in almost all practical cases. To find the
                    ratio of the kinetic to the static modulus remark that eØ, according to the
                    notation of section 74, is the diminution of the strain duo to the change of

                    (section 41), the strain actually produced by it when the body is not allowed

                <p>77. <hi rend="italic">Experimental Results.—</hi> The following tables show
                    determinations of moduluses of compression, of Young’s modulus, and of moduluses
                    of rigidity by various experimenters and various methods. It will be seen that
                    the Young’s moduluses obtained by Wertheim by vibrations, longitudinal or
                    transverse, are generally in excess of those which he found by static extension;
                    but the differences are enormously greater than those due to the heating and
                    cooling effects of elongation and contraction (section 76), and are to be
                    certainly reckoned as errors of observation. It is probable that his moduluses
                    determined by static elongation are minutely accurate; the discrepancies of
                    those found by vibrations are probably due to imperfections of the arrangements
                    for carrying out the vibrational method:—</p>

                <p>78. A question of great importance in the physical theory of the elasticity of
                    solids, “What changes are produced in the moduluses of elasticity by permanent
                    changes in its molecular condition,” has occupied the attention, no doubt, of
                    every “naturalist” who has studied the subject, and valuable contributions to
                    its answer by experiment had been given by Wertheim and other investigators, but
                    solely with reference to Young’s modulus. In 1865 an investigation of the effect
                    on the torsional rigidity of wires of different metals, produced by stretching
                    them longitudinally beyond their limits of elasticity, was commenced in the
                    physical laboratory of the university of Glasgow in its old buildings in 1865.
                    The following description of experiments and table of results is extracted from
                    the paper by W. Thomson “On the Elasticity and Viscosity of Metals,” already
                    quoted (section 30), with reference to viscosity and fatigue of elasticity.</p>
                <p>“Todetermine rigidities by torsional vibrations, taking advantage of an obvious
                    but most valuable suggestion made to me by Dr Joule, I used as vibrator in each
                    case a thin cylinder of sheet brass, turned true outside and inside (of which
                    the radius of gravitation must be, to a very close degree of approximation, the
                    arithmetic mean of the radii of the outer and inner cylindrical surfaces),<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is exactly the square root
                    of the mean of their squares.</p></note> supported by a thin flat rectangular
                    bar, of which the square√)f the radius of gravitation is one-third of the square
                    of the distance from the centre to the corner. The wire to be tested passed
                    perpendicularly through a hole in the middle of the bar, and was there lirmly
                    soldered. The cylinder was tied to the middle of the bar by light silk thread so
                    as to hang with its axis vertical. Each wire, after having been suspended and
                    stretched with just force enough to make it as nearly straight as was necessary
                    for accuracy, was vibrated. Then it was stretched by hand (applied to the cross
                    bar soldered to its lower end) and vibrated again, and stretched again, and so
                    on till it broke.” The experiments were performed with great care and accuracy
                    by Mr Donald M'Farlane. “The results, as shown in the accompanying table, were
                    most surprising.”</p>
                <p>The highest and lowest rigidities found for copper in the table are as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p>Highest rigidity 473 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> δ</hi>, being that of a wire
                    which had been softened by heating it to redness and plunging it into water, and
                    which was found to be of density 8'91.</p>
                <p>Lowest rigidity 393’4 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> δ</hi>, being that of a wire
                    which had been rendered so brittle by heating it to redness surrounded by
                    potvdered charcoal in a crucible and letting it cool very slowly, that it could
                    scarcely be touched without breaking it, and which had been found to be reduced
                    in density by this process to as low as 8'674. The wires used were all
                    commercial specimens—those of copper being all, or nearly all, cut from hanks
                    supplied by the Gutta Percha Company, having been selected as of high electric
                    conductivity, and of good mechanical quality, for submarine cables.</p>
                <p>It ought to be remarked that the change of molecular condition produced by
                    permanently stretching a wire or solid cylinder of metal is certainly a change
                    from a condition which, if originally isotropic, becomes aeolotropic as to some
                    qualities,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For example ,
                    see paper “On Electrodynamic Qualities of Metals,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> 1856, by W. Thomson.</p><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Remarks.</hi></p></note> and that the changed conditions may therefore be
                    presumed to be aeolotropic as to elasticity. If so, the rigidities corresponding
                    to the direct and diagonal distortions (indicated by No. 1 and No. 2 in fig. 14)
                    must in all probability become different from one another when a wire is
                    permanently stretched, instead of being equal as they must be when its substance
                    is isotropic. It becomes, therefore, a question of extreme interest to find
                    whether rigidity No. 2 is not <hi rend="italic">increased</hi> by this process,
                    which, as is proved by the experiments above described, diminishes, to a veιy
                    remarkable degree, the rigidity No. 1. The most obvious experiment, and indeed
                    the only practicable experiment, adapted to answer this question, for a wire or
                    round bar is that of Cagniard-Latour, in which an accurate determination of the
                    difference produced in the <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> of the substance is
                    made by applying and removing longitudinal traction within its limits of
                    elasticity. With the requisite apparatus, which must be much more accurate than
                    that of Cagniard-Latour, a most important and interesting investigation might be
                    made. The results, along with an accurate determination of the Young’s modulus
                    for the particular case, give (sec. 47) the modulus of compression, and the
                    rigidity No. 2. Régnault suggested the use of hollow instead of solid cylinders,
                    to be subjected to longitudinal pull, and (after the manner of the bulb and tube
                    of a thermometer) a capillary tube to aid in measuring changes of volume of the
                    hollow; and Wertheim, adopting this excellent suggestion, obtained seemingly
                    very accurate results for brass and glass, which are given in the tables of
                    section 77.</p>

                    Preliminary experiments by Mr J. T. Bottomley towards the investigation promised
                    in section 5 above have discovered a very remarkable property of soft iron wire
                    respecting its ultimate tensile strength. Eight different specimens, tested by
                    the gradual application of more and more weight within ten minutes of time in
                    each case until the wire broke, boro from 43⅛∙ to 46 lb (average 45 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2) just before breaking, with elongations of from 17
                    per cent to 22 per cent. Another specimen left with 43 lb hanging on it for 24
                    hours, and then tested by the gradual addition of weights during 25 minutes till
                    it broke, bore 49∣ lb before breaking, with elongation of 15 per cent. Another
                    left for 3 days 11 hours 40 minutes with 43 lb hanging on it, and then tested by
                    the gradual addition of weights during 31 minutes till it broke, bore 51⅜ lb
                    just before breaking, with elongation of 14 ’ 4 per cent. Another specimen of
                    the same wire was set up with 40 lb hanging on it on the 5th of July 1877, on
                    the Gth of July 3 It) were added, on the 9th 1⅛ lb more, and on the 10th ∣ lb
                    more, making in all on this date 451 lb. Thenceforward day by day, with
                    occasional intervals of two days or three days, the weight was increased first
                    by half a pound at a time, and latterly by a quarter of a pound at a time, until
                    on the 3d of September the wire broke with 57∣ lb (elongation not recorded).
                    This gradual addition of weight therefore had increased the tensile strength of
                    the metal by 26'7 per cent.!</p>
                <p>81. <hi rend="italic">Experiments made for this article.·</hi> —There are many
                    subjects in the theory of elasticity regarding which information to be obtained
                    by experiment only is greatly wanted. Several of these have been pointed out
                    above (section 21), and while this article was being put in type, experiments
                    were made in the physical laboratory of the university of Glasgow with a view of
                    answering some of the questions proposed. Mr Donald M <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> Farlane, besides making the experiments referred to insections 3 and 21,
                    investigated the effects of applying different amounts of pull to a steel
                    pianoforte wire which had been twisted to nearly its limits of elasticity, and
                    which was kept twisted by means of a couple. The results proved a deviation from
                    Hooke’s law by showing a diminution of the torsional rigidity, of about 1’6 per
                    cent., produced by hanging a weight of 112 lb on the wire. Of this 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2 per cent, is accounted for by elongation and by
                    shrinkage of the diameter, leaving ’ 4 per cent, of diminution of the
                    rigidity-modulus.</p>
                <p>It was also found that when the wire was twisted far beyond its limits of
                    elasticity, and then freed from torsional stress, a weight hung on it caused it
                    to untwist slightly. When the weight was removed and reapplied again and again,
                    the lower end of the wire always turned in the same direction as the permanent
                    twist when the weight was removed, and in the opposite direction when it was
                    applied. This result shows the development of aeolotropic quality in the
                    substance of the wire, according to which a small cube cut from any part of it
                    far out from the axis, with two sides of the cube parallel to the length, and
                    the other two pairs of sides making angles of 45° with the length, would show
                    different compressibilities in the directions perpendicular to the
                    last-mentioned pairs of sides.</p>
                <p>Another very interesting result, discovered in the course of these experiments,
                    was that when a length of five metres of the steel wire, with a weight of 39 lb
                    hung upon it, was twisted to the extent of 95 turns, it became gradually
                    elongated to the extent of - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅞ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> σ the length of the wire;
                    when farther twisted it began to shorten till, when 25 turns had been given (in
                    all 120 turns), the weight had risen from its lowest position through nearly <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7yo</hi><hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of the length of the wire, so that the
                    previous elongation had been diminished by about ∣ of its amount.</p>
                <p>Experiments were also made by Mr Andrew Gray and Mr Thomas Gray for the purpose
                    of determining the effects of various amounts of permanent twist in altering the
                    rigidity-modulus and the Young’s modulus of wires of copper, iron, and steel. A
                    copper wire, of 3 ’ 15 metres in length and ’ 154 centimetre diameter, No. 17
                    B.W.G., which had a rigidity-modulus of 442 million grammes per square
                    centimetre to begin with, was found to have 420 after 10 turns, showing a
                    diminution in the modulus of √ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of its own amount.
                    The diminution went on rapidly until 100 turns of permanent twist had been
                    given, when the modulus was·as low as 385. The diminution of the modulus
                    continued with further twist, but very slowly, up to 1225 turns, when the
                    modulus was found to be 371, showing a diminution to the extent of ⅜ of its
                    original value! There was little farther change until 1400 turns had been given,
                    when the modulus began to increase. At 1525 turns its value was 373, and at 1625
                    it was 377. Twenty turns more broke the wire before the torsional elasticity had
                    been again determined.</p>
                <p>A piece of iron wire of nearly the same length, about three metres, but of
                    smaller diameter (’ 087 centimetre), showed continued diminution of torsional
                    rigidity as far as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n842/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0842-0819"/> 1350 turns of permanent twist, when the
                    diminution had amounted to 14 per cent, of the primitive value, 36 turns more
                    broke the wire before another determination of torsional rigidity had been
                    made.</p>
                <p>The steel pianoforte wire also showed a diminution of torsional rigidity with
                    permanent twist, and (as did the copper wire) showed first a diminution and then
                    a slight augmentation. The amount of the diminution in the steel wire was
                    enormously greater than the surprisingly great amount which had been discovered
                    in the copper wire, and the ultimate augmentation was considerably greater in
                    the steel than what it had been in the copper before rupture. Thus after 473
                    turns of permanent twist the torsional modulus had diminished from 751 million
                    grammes per square centimetre to 414! 95 more turns of permanent twist augmented
                    the rigidity from 414 to 430, and when farther twisted the wire broke before
                    another observation had been made. The vibrator used in these experiments was a
                    cylinder of lead weighing 56 lb, which was kept hanging on the wire while it was
                    being twisted, and in fact during the whole of about 100 hours from the
                    beginning of the experiment till the wire broke, except on two occasions for a
                    few minutes, while the top fastening which had given way was being resoldered.
                    The period of vibration was augmented from 39 ’ 375 seconds to 51'9 seconds by
                    the twist. The wire took the twist very irregularly, some parts not beginning to
                    show much signs of permanent twist till near the end of the experiment</p>
                <p>In two specimens of copper wire of the same length and gauge as those described
                    above, the Young’s modulus was found to be increased 10 per cent, by 100 turns
                    of permanent twist.</p>
                <p>Five metres of the steel pianoforte wire, bearing a weight of 39 lb, was in one
                    of Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Farlane's experiments twisted 120 turns,
                    and then allowed to untwist, and 38∣ turns came out, leaving the wire in
                    equilibrium with 81'∣ turns of permanent twist. Its Young’s modulus was then
                    found not to differ as much as ∣ per cent, from the value it had before the wire
                    was twisted.</p>

                    ends of a wire or rod of any substance constitute a stress upon it. A body
                    pressed equally all round —for instance, any mass touched by air on all
                    sides—experiences a stress. A stone in a building experiences stress if it is
                    pressed upon by other stones, or by any parts of the structure, in contact with
                    it. Any part of a continuous solid mass, simply resting on a fixed base,
                    experiences stress from the surrounding parts in consequence of their weight.

                    in a piece of framework, becomes condensed or dilated in any direction, or bent,

                <p>For, just six independent parameters being required to express any stress or

                <p><hi rend="italic">Prop.</hi> If a body be strained according to any one of its
                    six Principal Types, the stress required to hold it so is directly concurrent
                    with the strain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Examples.—</hi> (1) If a solid be cubieally isotropic in its
                    elastic properties, as crystals of the cubical class probably are, any portion
                    of it will, when subject to a uniform positive or negative normal pressure all
                    round its surface, experience a uniform condensation or dilation in all
                    directions. Hence a uniform condensation is one of its six principal strains.
                    Tiιree plane distortions with axes bisecting the angles between the edges of the
                    cube of symmetry are clearly also principal strains, and since the three
                    corresponding principal elasticities are equal to one another, any strain
                    whatever compounded of these three is a principal strain. Lastly, a plane
                    distortion whose axes coincide with any two edges of the cube, being clearly a
                    principal distortion, and the principal elasticities corresponding to the three
                    distortions of this kind being equal to one another, any distortion compounded
                    of them is also a principal distortion.</p>
                <p>Hence the system of orthogonal types treated of in Examples (3) Chap. IX., und
                    (7) Chap. X., or any system in which, for (II.), (III.), and (IV.), any three
                    orthogonal strains compounded of them are substituted, constitutes a system of
                    six Principal Strains in a solid cubieally isotropic. There are only three
                    distinct Principal Elasticities for such a body, and these are—(A) its modulus
                    of compressibility, (B) its rigidity against diagonal distortion in any of its
                    principal planes (three equal elasticities), and (C) its rigidity against
                    rectangular distortions of a cube of symmetry (two equal elasticities).</p>
                <p>(2) In a perfectly isotropic solid, the rigidity against all distortions is
                    equal. Hence the rigidity (B) against diagonal distortion must be equal to the
                    rigidity (C) against rectangular distortion, in a cube; and it is easily seen
                    that if this condition is fulfilled for one set of three rectangular planes for
                    which a substance is isotropic, the isotropy must be complete. The conditions of
                    perfect or spherical isotropy are therefore expressed in terms of the conditions
                    referred to in the preceding example, with the farther condition B = C.</p>
                <p>A uniform condensation in all directions, and any system whatever of five
                    orthogonal distortions, constitute a system of six Principal strains in a
                    spherically isotropie solid. Its Principal Elasticities are simply its Modulus
                    of Compressibility and its Rigidity.</p>

                <p>It is easy to demonstrate that a body, homogeneous when regarded on a large
                    scale, may be constructed to have twenty-one arbitrarily prescribed values for
                    the coefficients in the expression for its potential energy in terms of any
                    prescribed system of strain coordinates. This proposition was first enunciated
                    in the paper on the Thermo-elastic Properties of Solids, published April 1855,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Mathematical Journal</hi> alluded to above.
                    We may infer the following.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prop.</hi> A solid may be constructed to have arbitrarily
                    prescribed values for its six Principal Elasticities and an arbitrary orthogonal
                    system of six strain-types, specified by fifteen independent elements, for its
                    principal strains: for instance, five arbitrarily chosen systems of three
                    rectangular axes, for the normal axes of five of the Principal Types; those of
                    the sixth consequently in general distinct from all the others, and determinate;
                    and the six times two ratios between the three stresses or strains of each type,
                    also determinate. The fifteen equations expressing (Chap. VI.) the mutual
                    orthogonality of the six types determine the twelve ratios for the six types,
                    and the three quantities specifying the axes of the sixth type in the particular
                    case here suggested: or generally the fifteen equations determine fifteen out of
                    the thirty quantities (viz. twelve ratios and eighteen angular coordinates)
                    specifying six Principal Types.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> There is no reason for believing that natural
                    crystals do not exist for which there are six unequal Principal Elasticities,

                    distinct sets of three principal rectangular axes of elasticity.</p>
                <p>It is easy to give arbitrary illustrative examples regarding Principal
                    Elasticities: also, to investigate the principal strain-types and the equations
                    of elastic force referred to them or to other natural types, for a body
                    possessing the kind of symmetry as to elastic forces that is possessed by a
                    crystal of Iceland spar, or by a crystal of the “tesseral class,” or of the
                    included “cubical class.” Such illustrations and developments, though proper for
                    a students’ text book of the subject, are unnecessary here.</p>

                    different velocities, we have just two,—a wave (like that of sound in air or
                    other elastic fluid) in which the motions are perpendicular to the wave front,
                    and the other (like the waves of light in an isotropic medium) in which the
                    motions are parallel to the wave front.</p>

                    >(Aeolotrognc</hi><hi rend="italic">or Isotropic).—</hi> If the solid be

                <p>and by a determinantal quadratic, instead of cubic, we find two wave-velocities
                    and two wave-modes, in each of which the motion is parallel to the wave front.
                    In the case of isotropy the two wave velocities are equal.</p>
                <p>It is to be noticed that M <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, M <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, M <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in the preceding investigation are not
                    generally true “principal moduluses,” but special moduluses corresponding to the
                    particular plane chosen for the wave front. In the particular case of isotropy,
                    however, the equal moduluses M <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, M <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of (11) are principal moduluses, being each equal to
                    <hi rend="italic">the</hi> modulus of rigidity, but M <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> is a mixed modulus of compressibility and rigidity—not a principal
                    modulus. In the case of irfcompressi-bility, the two moduluses found from the
                    determinantal quadratic by the process indicated above are not principal
                    moduluses generally, because the distortions by the differential motions of
                    planes of particles parallel to the wave front must generally give rise to
                    tangential stresses orthogonal to them, which do not influence the wave motion.
