                    extensive changes have been made in the distribution of the revenues of the
                    Church of England. It was one of the results of the vigorous movements for the
                    reform of public institutions which followed the Reform Act of 1832. In 1835 two
                    commissions were appointed “to consider the state of the several dioceses of
                    England and Wales, with reference to the amount of their revenues and the more
                    equal distribution of episcopal duties, and <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> the
                    prevention of the necessity of attaching by commendam to bishoprics certain
                    benefices with cure of souls; and to consider also the state of the several
                    cathedral and collegiate churches in England and Wales, with a view to the
                    suggestion of such measures as might render them conducive to the efficiency of
                    the established church, and to provide for the best mode of providing for the
                    cure of souls, with special reference to the residence of the clergy on their
                    respective benefices.” And it was enacted by 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 30 that during
                    the existence of the commission the profits of dignities and benefices without
                    cure of souls becoming vacant should be paid over to the treasurer of Queen
                    Anne’s Bounty. In consequence of the recommendation of these commissioners, a.
                    permanent commission was appointed by 6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 77, for the purpose
                    of preparing and laying before the king in council such schemes as should appear
                    to them to be best adapted for carrying into effect the alterations suggested in
                    the report of the original commission and recited in the Act. The new commission
                    was constituted a corporation with power to purchase and hold lands for the
                    purposes of the Act, notwithstanding the statutes of mortmain. The first members
                    of the commission were the two archbishops and three bishops, the lord
                    chancellor and the principal officers of state, and three laymen named in the
                    Act. By a later Act (3 and 4 Vict. c. 113) all the bishops, the chiefs of the
                    three courts at Westminster, the master of the Rolls, and the judges of the
                    Prerogative Court and Court of Admiralty, and the deans of Canterbury, St
                    Paul’s, and Westminster were added to the commission; and power was given to the
                    crown to appoint four, and the archbishop of Canterbury to appoint two
                    additional lay commissioners. The lay commissioners are required to be “members
                    of the United Church of England and Ireland, and to subscribe a declaration to
                    that effect.” Five are a quorum; but two bishops at least must be present at any
                    proceeding under the common seal of the commission, and if only two are present
                    they can demand its postponement to a subsequent meeting. Paid commissioners,
                    under the title of church estates commissioners, are also appointed—two by the
                    crown and one by the archbishop of Canterbury. These three are the joint
                    treasurers of the commission, and constitute, along with two members appointed
                    by the commission, the church estates committee, charged with all business
                    relating to the sale, purchase, exchange, letting, or management of any lands,
                    tithes, or hereditaments. The commission has power to make inquiries and examine
                    witnesses on oath. The schemes of the commission having, after due notice to
                    persons affected thereby, been laid before the Queen in Council, may be ratified
                    by orders, specifying the times when they shall take effect, and such orders
                    when published in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> have the same force
                    and effect as Acts of Parliament.</p>
                <p>The recommendations cf the commission recited in 6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 97 are too
                    numerous to be given here. They include an extensive re-arrangement of the
                    dioceses, equalization of episcopal income, providing residences, &amp;c. By 3
                    and 4 Vict. c. 113 the fourth report of the original commissioners, dealing
                    chiefly with cathedral and collegiate churches, was carried into effect, a large
                    number of canonries being suspended, and sinecure benefices and dignities
                    suppressed.</p>
                <p>The emoluments of these suppressed or suspended offices, and the surplus income
                    of the episcopal sees, constitute the fund at the disposal of the commissioners.
                    By 23 and 24 Vict. c. 124, on the avoidance of any bishopric or archbishopric,
                    all the land and emoluments of the see, except the patronage and lands attached
                    to houses of residence, become, by Order in Council, vested in the
                    commissioners, who may, however, reassign to the see so much of the land as may
                    be sufficient to secure the net annual income named for it by statute or order.
                    All the profits and emoluments of the suspended canonries, &amp;c., pass over to
                    the commissioners, as well as the separate estates of those deaneries and
                    canonries which are not suspended. Out of this fund the expenses of the
                    commission are to be paid, and the residue is to be devoted to increasing the
                    efficiency of the church by the augmentation of the smaller bishoprics and of
                    poor livings, the endowment of new churches, and employment of additional
                    ministers.</p>
                <p>The substitution of one central corporation for the many local and independent
                    corporations of the church, so far at least as the management of property is
                    concerned, was a constitutional change of great importance, and the effect of it
                    has undoubtedly been to correct the anomalous distribution of ecclesiastical
                    revenues by equalizing incomes and abolishing sinecures. At the same time it is
                    regarded as having made a serious breach in the legal theory of ecclesiastical
                    property. “The important principle,” says Cripps, “on which the inviolability of
                    the church establishment depends, that the church generally possesses no
                    property as a corporation, or which is applicable to general purposes, but that
                    such particular ecclesiastical corporation, whether aggregate or sole, has its
                    property separate, distinct, and inalienable, according to the intention of the
                    original endowment, was given up without an effort to defend it” <hi
