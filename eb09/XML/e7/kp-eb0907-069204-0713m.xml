                <p><label type="entry">EEL</label>, a name applied more or less generally to all the
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Muraenidoe,</hi> a family of soft-finned apodal
                    fishes, but more specially applicable to the species belonging to the sub-family
                    <hi rend="italic">Anguillina.</hi> The body throughout the family of eels is
                    greatly elongated and of snake-like form. The ventral fins are awanting in all
                    the species, while in certain forms, as the Muraena, the pectoral fins are also
                    absent. The skin is thick and soft, and is covered over with a glutinous
                    secretion which gives the eel its proverbial slipperiness. It is also
                    sufficiently tough to enable it to be stripped entire from the body, and in some
                    countries the skin is thus used as a bag or purse. Scales, disposed in groups,
                    are present in the eels belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Anguilla,</hi>
                    but they are so buried beneath the outer layer or scarf skin as not to be
                    apparent, while in such forms as the conger they are altogether awanting. The
                    bronchial openings are small, and lead into a sac, from which another sac is
                    given off. The gills are thus exposed but slightly to the drying influence of
                    the atmosphere, and it is owing to this, and to the slimy condition of the skin,
                    that eels can exist for a considerable time out of water. According to Dr
                    Günther, the <hi rend="italic">Muraenidoe</hi> comprise 26 genera and 230
                    species, inhabiting the seas and fresh waters of temperate and tropical regions.
                    Of these only the true eels, <hi rend="italic">Anguilla,</hi> inhabit fresh
                    water, although most of the latter are likewise marine.</p>
                <p>Although abounding in almost every river, lake, and estuary in Europe, little was
                    known until recently of the life-history of the fresh-water eels. With regard to
                    their origin Aristotle believed that they sprang from the mud, Pliny that they
                    took their rise from portions of the skin scraped off the parent body, while
                    horse hairs and May-dew have both been regarded as fertile sources of eels.
                    Until quite recently, they were regarded by naturalists as viviparous, a mistake
                    which probably arose from the frequent presence of parasitic worms, supposed to
                    be the young, in their bodies, aud the absence of anything exactly resembliug
                    milt and roe as usually found. Like all other Teleostean fishes they are
                    oviparous, the milt and roe occurring in the same position, but differing
                    considerably in appearance from those elements in other fishes. The spawn of the
                    eel is generally deposited in sand and mud at the mouths of rivers, aud in
                    harbours where the water is brackish. To reach these spawning grounds, eels
                    migrate in autumn down the river channels, and at those times they <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0714-0693"/> are taken in large numbers by various devices,
                    such as the “eel-buck” of the Thames, a wooden framework supporting wicker
                    baskets, the mouths of which are opposed to the stream, and which are so
                    constructed that the fish when once inside is unable to extricate itself. When
                    there are obstacles in the way of their getting to the sea, eels are known to
                    deposit their spawn in the beds of fresh-water streams, but it is still doubtful
                    whether this may not also occur in cases where the sea is quite accessible. Eels
                    are peculiarly averse to cold, and the fact that the temperature of the brackish
                    waters of estuaries is always higher than that of unmixed salt or fresh water is
                    an additional reason for their seaward migration on the approach of winter. In
                    performing this journey the darkest nights are chosen, the moonlight being
                    sufficient to stay their progress. During the cold of winter they lose their
                    appetite and become torpid, large numbers of them congregating together for the
                    sake of the additional warmth thus obtained, and burying themselves to a depth
                    of 12 to 16 inches in places where the receding tide leaves them dry. In such
                    places they are taken in large numbers by means of eel-spears. In Somersetshire,
                    according to Yarrell, “the people know how to find the holes in the banks of the
                    rivers in which eels are laid up, by the hoar frost not lying over them as it
                    does elsewhere, and dig them out in heaps.” In spring, the migration of the
                    young eels up the rivers takes place, the parents, according to some observers,
                    performing a similar journey. This migration takes place from February to May,
                    according to the temperature, and some idea of the vast numbers of young eels
                    which annually pass up our rivers may be formed from the fact that 1800 of them,
                    each about 3 inches long, have been observed to pass a given point on the Thames
                    in a single minute. This monster procession of <hi rend="italic">elvers,</hi> as
                    these young eels are called, is known on the Thames as <hi rend="italic"
                    >eelfare,</hi> and usually takes place about the beginning of May; and at these
                    times, unfortunately, they are often caught in countless numbers iu sieves,
                    especially on the Severn, cartloads of them being sometimes seen for sale in the
                    Exeter market. This upward migration, unlike that of autumn, is performed
                    entirely by day, and it is carried through in spite of obstacles apparently
                    insuperable to a fish. Eels have been known to climb up steep ascents, 20 feet
                    above the water, showing great skill and ingenuity in availing themselves of
                    whatever natural aids the locality might afford. Couch tells of a remarkable
                    case in the neighbourhood of Bristol, where the elvers passed from one stream to
                    another by means of a tree which stood between, and the branches of which dipped
                    into the water of the lower. Ascending by these, the eels dropped from the
                    branches on the opposite side into the upper stream. In some parts of Ireland
                    the fishermen place haybands on the rocky parts of the river-courses, iu order
                    to facilitate the upward progress of the eels. The most effectual obstacle,
                    however, to their advance in either direction is found in a muddy or polluted
                    state of the water; and old eels, to get rid of such nauseous conditions, have
                    been known to leave the water and travel for considerable distances in search of
                    purer surroundings. When confined also in ponds they often show their migratory
                    instinct by leaving these in the night time, and attempting to make their way to
                    the nearest river or to the sea.</p>
                <p>Like most animals that pass the winter in a torpid condition, eels are
                    exceedingly voracious during the summer months, occasionally eating vegetables,
                    but generally preferring such animal food as young fishes, worms, and the larvae
                    of insects; they have also been known to devour much larger creatures, as
                    water-hens, rats, and snakes. Although their food is thus very various, it is
                    essential that it be fresh, eels at once rejecting whatever their keen sense of
                    smell detects as tainted. Eels were held in great esteem by the Greeks and
                    Romans, and enormous prices were sometimes paid for them; by the Egyptians, on
                    the other band, they were held in abhorrence. Their snake-like appearance has
                    had much to do with the prejudice entertained by many people against eels, and
                    to this may be attributed the fact that in Scotland this valuable fish is almost
                    wholly rejected as an article of food. Their value in this respect has, however,
                    been recognized in England from very early times, the taste for eels having
                    probably been acquired during the Roman occupation. The Venerable Bede states
                    that England in his time was famous for its salmon and eel fisheries, and Ely is
                    said to have got its name from the abundance of the eels in that fenny
                    neighbourhood. Eels are very largely consumed in London, the greater proportion
                    of these, numbering about 10 millions, being brought alive annually from Holland
                    in welled boats. The greatest eel-breeding establishment in the world is that at
                    Commachio on the. Adriatic, where an immense swamp, bounded and fed by two of
                    the mouths of the river Po, 140 miles in circumference, has been utilized for
                    this purpose. The industry is very ancient, having yielded in the 16th century
                    an annual revenue to the Roman Pontiffs, in whose territory it was, of £12,000.
                    The eels are cooked at Commachio, aud forwarded to the principal towns of I
                    taly.</p>
                <p>The best known and most widely distributed fresh-water species is the Sharp-nosed
                    Eel <hi rend="italic">(Anguilla vulgaris).</hi> It occurs, according to Dr
                    Günther, in Europe to 64 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> 30' N. lat., in the
                    Mediterranean region, and in North America, but neither in the Danube, nor in
                    the Black and Caspian Seas. Like all other eels it is of comparatively slow
                    growth, but often attains a large size, measuring sometimes 5 feet in length,
                    and weighing in such cases from 20 to 30 lb. Few eels, however, weigh more than
                    6 lb. They are believed to be long-lived, one authentic instance being known of
                    an eel which was at least 31 years old. The colour of the species is generally
                    dark olive-green on the upper surface, becoming lighter on the sides, and white
                    beneath; but the colour depends somewhat on the nature of the stream it
                    inhabits, those obtained in pure water being known as silver eels from the
                    lightness of their colour, while those found in muddy rivers are darker.</p>
                <p>The Conger <hi rend="italic">(Conger vulgaris)</hi> is the only British species
                    of sea-eel. It differs from the true eels in having the upper jaw projecting
                    beyond the lower, and in the entire absence of scales. It is abundant in all
                    parts of the British coasts, especially on rocky ground, and attains a length of
                    10 feet, weighing in large examples over 100 lb. The conger is exceedingly
                    voracious, feeding on other fishes, and not sparing even its own kind. Its jaws
                    are strong and well-armed, and the capture of a large specimen is not unattended
                    with danger to the fisherman. Its tail is exceedingly sensitive and prehensile,
                    the conger being able with this organ to grasp the gunwale of the boat, and by a
                    sudden contraction of the muscles to throw itself overboard, a smart blow on the
                    tail, however, is sufficient to prevent the possibility of this occurrence. The
                    conger is peculiarly sensitive to cold, andjduring severe frosts it is often
                    taken floating helplessly on the surface of the sea. Mr F. Buckland states that
                    in 1855 thousands of congers w ere found floating upon the water; they could
                    progress readily in any direction on the surface, but could not descend, and
                    consequently fell an easy prey to the boatmen. In this way, no less than 80 tons
                    were captured. “The action of the frost,” he says, “caused the air in their
                    swimming bladders to expand so much that the ordinary muscles could not expel it
                    at will.” The chief conger fisheries are on the south and west coasts of
                    England, but these are not nearly so productive now as they formerly were. The
                    flesh is not held in much esteem.</p>

                <p>The Electric Eel <hi rend="italic">{Gymnolus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >electricus)</hi> belongs to a different family of apodal fishes <hi
                    rend="italic">{Gymnοtidce).</hi> In it both caudal and dorsal fins are entirely
                    awanting, and the anal fin is very long, forming a fringe from the throat to the
                    extremity of the tail. It attains a length of 5 or G feet, and frequents the
                    marshes of Brazil and the Guianas, where it is regarded with terror, owing to
                    the formidable electrical apparatus with which it is provided, and which extends
                    along each side of the lower portion of the tail. When this natural battery is
                    discharged in a favourable position, it is sufficiently powerful to kill the
                    largest animal; and, according to Humboldt, it has been found necessary to
                    change the line of certain roads, owing to the number of horses that were
                    annually killed in passing through the pools frequented by the gymnoti. These
                    eels are eaten by the Indians, who, before attempting to capture them, seek to
                    exhaust their electrical power by driving horses into the ponds. By repeated
                    discharges upon these, they gradually expend this marvellous force; after which,
                    being defenceless, they become timid, and approach the edge for shelter, when
                    they fall an easy prey to the harpoon of the Indian. It is only after long rest
                    and abundance of food, that this fish is able to resume the use of its subtle
                    weapon. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">gi.)</hi></p>
