                <p><label type="entry">EARTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Figure of the</hi></label>. The
                    determination of the figure of the earth is a problem of the highest importance
                    in astronomy, inasmuch as the diameter of the earth is the unit to which all
                    celestial distances must be referred. Reasoning, doubtless, from the uniform
                    level appearance of the horizon in any situation in which a spectator can be
                    placed—the variations in altitude of the circumpolar stars as one travels
                    towards the north or south, the disappearance of a ship standing out to sea, and
                    perhaps other phenomena— the earliest astronomers universally regarded this
                    earth as a sphere, and they endeavoured to ascertain its dimensions. Aristotle
                    relates that the mathematicians had found the circumference to be 400,000
                    stadia. But Eratosthenes appears to have been the first who entertained an
                    accurate idea of the principles on which the determination of the figure of the
                    earth really depends, and attempted to reduce them to practice. His results were
                    very inaccurate, but his method is the same as that which is followed at the
                    present day—depending, in fact, on the comparison of a line measured on the
                    earth’s surface with the corresponding arc of the heavens. He observed that at
                    Syene in Upper Egypt, on the day of the summer solstice, the sun was exactly
                    vertical, whilst at Alexandria at the same season of the year its zenith
                    distance was 7° 12', or one-fiftieth of the circumference of a circle. He
                    assumed that these places were on the same meridian; and, reckoning their
                    distance apart as 5000 stadia, he inferred that the circumference of the earth
                    was 250,000 stadia. A similar attempt was made by Posidonius, who adopted a
                    method which differed from that of Eratosthenes only in using a star instead of
                    the sun. He obtained 240,000 stadia for the circumference. But it is impossible
                    to form any correct opinions as to the degree of accuracy attained in these
                    measures, as the length of the stadium is unknown. Ptolemy in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Geography</hi> assigns the length of the degree as 500 stadia.</p>
                <p>The Arabs, who were not inattentive to astronomy, did not overlook the question
                    of the earth’s magnitude. The caliph Almamoum, 814 A.D., having fixed on a spot
                    in the plains of Mesopotamia, despatched one company of astronomers northwards
                    and another southwards, measuring the journey by rods, until each found the
                    altitude of the pole to have changed one degree. But the result of this
                    measurement does not appear to have been very satisfactory. From this time the
                    subject seems to have attracted no attention until about 1500, when Fern el, a
                    Frenchman, measured a distance in the direction of the meridian near Paris by
                    counting the number of revolutions of the wheel of his carriage as he travelled.
                    His astronomical observations were made with a triangle used as a quadrant, and
                    his resulting length of a degree was by a happy chance very near the truth.</p>
                <p>The next geodesist, Willebrυrd Snell, took an immense step in the right direction
                    by substituting a chain of triangles for actual linear measurement. The account
                    of this operation was published at Leyden in 1617. He measured his base line on
                    the frozen surface of the meadows near Leyden, and measured the angles of his
                    triangles, which lay between Alkmaar and Bergen-op-Zoom, with a quadrant and
                    semicircles. He took the precaution of comparing his standard with that of the
                    French, so that his result was expressed in toises (the length of the toise is
                    about 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 39 English feet). The work was recomputed
                    and reobserved by Muschenbroek in 1729.</p>
                <p>In 1637 an Englishman, Richard Norwood, published his own determination of the
                    figure of the earth in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">The Seaman's
                    Practice, cοntayniηg</hi><hi rend="italic">a Fundamentali</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Probleme</hi><hi rend="italic">in Navigation experimentally verified, namely,
                    touching the</hi><hi rend="italic">Compasse</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Earth
                    and Sea and the quantity of a Degree in our English Measures.</hi> It appears
                    that he observed on the 11th June 1633 the sun’s meridian altitude in London as
                    62° Γ, and on June 6, 1635, his meridian altitude in York as 59° 33 ’. He
                    measured the distance between these places along the public road partly with a
                    chain and partly by pacing. By this means, through compensation of errors, he
                    arrived at 367,176 feet for the degree—a very fair result.</p>
                <p>The application of the telescope to circular instruments was the next important
                    step in the science of measurement. Picard was the first who in 1669, with the
                    telescope, using such precautions as the nature of the operation requires,
                    measured an arc of meridian. He measured with wooden rods a base line of 5663
                    toises, and a second or base of verification of 3902 toises; his triangulation
                    extended from Mal voisine, near Paris, to Sourdon, near Amiens. The angles of
                    the triangles were measured with a quadrant furnished with a telescope having
                    cross-wires in its focus. The difference of latitude of the terminal stations
                    was determined by observations made "with a sector on a star in Cassiopeia,
                    giving 1° 22' 55'' for the amplitude. The terrestrial measurement gave 78,850
                    toises, whence he inferred for the length of the degree 57,060 toises.</p>
                <p>Hitherto geodetic observations had been confined to the determination of the
                    magnitude of the earth considered as a sphere, but a discovery made by Richer
                    turned tho attention of mathematicians to its deviation from a spherical form.
                    This astronomer, having been sent by the Academy of Sciences of Paris to the
                    island of Cayenne, in South America, for the purpose of determining the amount
                    of terrestrial refraction and other astronomical objects, observed that his
                    clock, which had been regulated at Paris to beat seconds, lost about two minutes
                    and a half daily at Cayenue, and that in order to bring it to measure mean solar
                    time it was necessary to shorten the pendulum by more than a line. This fact,
                    which appeared exceedingly curious, and was scarcely credited till it had been
                    confirmed by the subsequent observations of Varin and Deshayes on the coasts of
                    Africa and America, was first explained in the third book of Newton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> who showed that it could only be referred to a
                    diminution of gravity arising either from a protuberance of the equatorial parts
                    of the earth and consequent increase of the distance from the centre or from the
                    counteracting effect of the centrifugal force. About the same time, 1673,
                    appeared the work of Huyghens entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Horologio</hi><hi rend="italic">Oscillator™,</hi> in which for the
                    first time were found correct notions on the subject of centrifugal force. It
                    does not, however, appear that they were applied to the theoretical
                    investigation of the figure of the earth before the publication of Newton's <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia.</hi> In 1690 Huyghens, following up the subject,
                    published his treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De Causa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gravitatis,</hi> which contains an investigation of the figure of the earth on
                    the supposition that the attraction of every particle is towards the centre.</p>
                <p>Between 1684 and 1718 J. and D. Cassini, starting from Picard’s base, carried a
                    triangulation northwards from Paris to Dunkirk and southwards from Paris to
                    Collioure. They measured a base of 7246 toises near Perpignan, and a somewhat
                    shorter base near Dunkirk; and from the northern portion of the arc, which had
                    an amplitude of 2’ 12' 9", obtained for the length of a degree 56,960 toises;
                    while from the southern portion, of which the amplitude was 6° 18' 57'', they
                    obtained 57,097 toises. The immediate inference from this was that, the degree
                    diminishing with increasing latitude, the earth must be a prolate spheroid. This
                    conclusion was totally opposed to the theoretical investigations of Newton and
                    Huyghens, and created a great sensation among the scientific men of the day. The
                    question was far too important to be allowed to remain unsettled, and
                    accordingly the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive test
                    by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other. For this purpose
                    some of the most distinguished <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n619/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0619-0598"/> members of their body undertook the measurement
                    of two meridian arcs—one in the neighbourhood of the equator, the other in a
                    high latitude; and so arose the celebrated expeditions of the French
                    Academicians. In May 1735, MM. Godin, Bouguer, and De la Condamine, under the
                    auspices of Louis XV., proceeded to Peru, where, assisted by two Spanish
                    officers, after ten years of laborious exertion they measured an arc of 3° 7'
                    intersected by the equator. The second party consisted of Maupertuis, Clairaut,
                    Camus, Lemonnier, and Outhier, who reached the Gulf of Bothnia in July 1736;
                    they were in some respects more fortunate than the first party, inasmuch as they
                    completed the measurement of an arc near the polar circle of 57'amplitude and
                    returned to Europe within sixteen months from the date of their departure.</p>
                <p>The measurement of Bouguer and De la Condamine was executed with great care, and
                    on account of the locality, as well as the manner in which all the details were
                    conducted, it has always been regarded as a most valuable determination. The
                    southern limit was at a place called Tarqui, the northern at Cotchesqui. A base
                    of 6272 toises was measured in the vicinity of Quito, near the northern
                    extremity of the arc, and a second base of 5260 toises near the southern
                    extremity. The mountainous nature of the country made the work very laborious,
                    in some instances the difference of heights of two neighbouring stations
                    exceeding a mile. The difficulties with which the observers had to contend were
                    increased by the opposition of the more ignorant of the inhabitants, and they
                    were at times in danger of losing their lives. They had also much trouble with
                    their instruments, those with which they were to determine the latitudes proving
                    untrustworthy. But their energy and ingenuity were equal to the occasion, and
                    they succeeded by simultaneous observations of the same star at the two
                    extremities of the arc in obtaining very fair results. The whole length of the
                    arc amounted to 176,945 toises, while the difference of latitudes was 3° 7' 3”.
                    In consequence of a misunderstanding that arose between De la Condamine and
                    Bouguer, their operations were conducted separately, and each wrote a full and
                    interesting account of the operation. Bouguer’s book was published in 1749; that
                    of De la Condamine in 1751. The toise used in this measure was ever after
                    regarded as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> standard toise, and is always referred to
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Toise of Peru.</hi></p>
                <p>The party of Maupertuis, though their work was quickly despatched, had also to
                    contend with great difficulties. They were disappointed in not being able to
                    make use of the small islands in the Gulf of Bothnia for the trigonometrical
                    stations, and were forced to penetrate into the forests of Lapland. They
                    commenced operations at Tornea, a city situated on the mainland near the
                    extremity of the gulf. From this, the southern extremity of their arc, they
                    carried a chain of triangles northward to the mountain Kittis, which they
                    selected as the northern terminus. In the prosecution of this work they suffered
                    greatly from cold and the bites of flies and gnats. The latitudes were
                    determined by observations with a sector (made by Graham) of the zenith distance
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and δ Draconis. The base line was measured on the
                    frozen surface of the river Tornea about the middle of the arc; two parties
                    measured it separately, and they differed by about 4 inches. The result of the
                    whole was that the difference of latitudes of the terminal stations was 57' 29"
                    ’ 6, and the length of the arc 55,023 toises. In this expedition, as well as in
                    that to Peru, observations were made with a pendulum to determine the force of
                    gravity; and these observations coincided with the geodetical results in proving
                    that the earth was an oblate and not prolate spheroid.</p>
                <p>In 1740 was published in the Paris <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> an account, by
                    Cassini de Thury, of a remeasurement by himself and Lacaille of the meridian of
                    Paris. With a view to determine more accurately the variation of the degree
                    along the meridian, they divided the distance from Dunkirk to Collioure into
                    four partial arcs of about two degrees each, by observing the latitude at five
                    stations. The anomalous results previously obtained by J. and D. Cassini were
                    not confirmed, but on the contrary the length of the degree derived from these
                    partial arcs showed on the whole an increase with increasing latitude. In
                    continuation of their labours, Cassini and Lacaille further measured an arc of
                    parallel across the mouth of the Rhone. The difference of time of the
                    extremities was determined by the observers at either end noting the instant of
                    a signal given by flashing gunpowder at a point near the middle of the arc.</p>
                <p>While at the Cape of Good Hope in 1752, engaged in various astronomical
                    observations, Lacaille measured an arc of meridian of 1° 13' 17'', which gave
                    him for the length of the degree 57,037 toises—an unexpected result, which has
                    led to the modern remeasurement of the arc by Sir Thomas Maclear.</p>
                <p>Passing over the measurements made between Rome and Rimini and on the plains of
                    Piedmont by the Jesuits Boscovich and Beccaria, and also the arc measured with
                    deal rods in North America by Messrs Mason and Dixon, we come to the
                    commencement of the English triangulation. In 1783, in consequence of a
                    representation from Cassini de Thury on the advantages that would accrue to
                    science from the geodetic connection of Paris and Greenwich, General Roy was
                    with the king’s approval appointed by the Royal Society to conduct the
                    operations on the part of this country,—Count Cassini, Mechain, and Delambre
                    being appointed on the French side. And now a precision previously unknown was
                    brought into geodesy by the use of Ramsden’s splendid theodolite, which, was the
                    first to make the spherical excess of triangles measurable. The wooden rods with
                    which the first base was measured were speedily replaced by glass rods, which
                    again were rejected for the steel chain of Ramsden. The details of this
                    operation are fully given in the <hi rend="italic">Account of the
                    Trigonometrical Survey of England and Wales.</hi> Shortly after this, the
                    National Convention of France, having agreed to remodel their system of weights
                    and measures, chose, as applicable to all countries, for their unit of length
                    the ten-millionth part of the meridian quadrant. In order to obtain this length
                    precisely, the remeasurement of the French meridian was resolved on, and deputed
                    to Delambre and Mechain. The details of this great operation will be found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Base</hi><hi rend="italic">du Système Métrique
                    Décimale.</hi> The arc was subsequently extended by MM. Biot and Arago to the
                    island of Iviza.</p>
                <p>The appearance in 1838 of Bessel’s classical work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gradmessung</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Ostpreussen</hi>
                    marks an era in the science of geodesy. Here we find the method of least
                    squares, a branch of the theory of probabilities, applied to the calculation of
                    a network of triangles and the reduction of the observations generally. This
                    work has been looked on as a model ever since, and probably it will not soon be
                    superseded as such. The systematic manner in which all the observations were
                    taken with the view of securing final results of extreme accuracy is admirable.
                    The triangulation, which is a small one, extends about a degree and a half along
                    the shores of the Baltic in a N.N.E. direction. The compound bars with which he
                    measured his base line may be understood by the following brief description. On
                    the surface of an iron bar two toises in length is laid a zinc bar, both being
                    very perfectly planed and in free contact— the zinc bar being slightly shorter
                    than the iron bar. They are united at one end only, and as the temperature
                    varies the difference of length of the bars as seen at the other end varies;
                    this difference of length is a thermometrical indication<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0620-0599"/> whereby a correction for temperature can be
                    applied to the bars so as to reduce their length to that at the standard
                    temperature. The bars in measuring were not allowed to come into contact, but
                    the intervals left were measured by the interposition of a glass wedge. The
                    results of all the comparisons of the four measuring rods with one another, and
                    with the standards, are elaborately worked out by least squares. The angles were
                    observed with theodolites of 12 and 15 inches diameter, and the latitudes
                    determined by means of the transit instrument in the prime vertical—a method
                    much used in Germany. The formulae employed in the reduction of the astronomical
                    observations are very elegant. The reduction of the triangulation waβ carried
                    out in the most thorough manner,—the sum of the squares of all the actual
                    theodolite observations being made a minimum. As it is usual now to follow this
                    method (sometimes only approximately) in all triangulations where great
                    precision is required, we here give a brief description of the method. The
                    equations of condition of a triangulation are those which exist between the
                    supernumerary observed quantities and their calculated values, for, after there
                    are just sufficient observations to fix all the points, then any angle that may
                    be subsequently observed can be compared with its calculated value. If a
                    triangulation consist of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> + 2 points, two of which are
                    the ends of a base line, then to fix the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> points 2n
                    angles suffice; so that if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the actual number of
                    angles really observed, the triangulation must afford <hi rend="italic">m -
                    2n</hi> equations of condition. To show how these arise, suppose that from a
                    number <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of fixed points A, B, C . . . a new point P is
                    observed, which <hi rend="italic">m</hi> points are again observed from P, then
                    there will be formed <hi rend="italic">m</hi>- 1 triangles, in each of which the
                    sum of the observed angles is = 180° + the spherical excess; this gives at once
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi>- 1 equations of condition. The <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    — 2 distances will each afford an equation of the form</p>
                <p>PC PB PA</p>
                <p>PB ’ PA PC ’</p>
                <p>not, however, limited to three factors. Should P observe the <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> points and not be observed back, there will be <hi rend="italic">m</hi>-
                    3 equations of the above form (they are called side equations). In a similar
                    manner other cases can be treated. In practice the ratios of sides are replaced
                    by the ratios of the sines of the corresponding opposite angles. To each
                    observed angle a symbolical correction is applied, so that if α be an observed
                    angle and <hi rend="italic">a + x</hi> the true or most probable angle, sin (α +
                    z) = sin α(1 <hi rend="italic">+ x cot a), x</hi> being a small angle whose
                    square is neglected. Thus the side equation takes the form <hi rend="italic">β +
                    β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> λ</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> χ</hi><hi rend="italic">+ β</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>The great meridian arc in India was commenced by Colonel Lambton at Punnoe in
                    latitude 8° 9'. Following generally the methods of the English survey, he
                    carried his triangulation as far north as 20° 30'. The work then passed into the
                    able hands of Sir George (then Captain) Everest, who continued it to the
                    latitude of 29° 30'. Two admirably written volumes by Sir George Everest,
                    published in 1830 and in 1847, give all the details of the vast undertaking. The
                    great trigonometrical survey of India is now being prosecuted with great
                    scientific skill by Colonel Walker, R.E., and it may be expected that we shall
                    soon have some valuable contributions to the great problem of geodesy. The
                    working out of the Indian chains of triangle by the method of least squares
                    presents peculiar difficulties, but enormous in extent as the work is, it is
                    being thoroughly carried out. The ten base lines on which the survey depends
                    were measured with Colby’s compensation bars.</p>
                <p>These compensation bars were also used by Sir Thomas Maclear in the measurement
                    of the base line in his extension of Lacaille’s arc at the Cape. The account of
                    this operation will be found in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Verification
                    and Extension of Lacaille’s Arc of Meridian at the Cape of Good Hope,</hi> by
                    Sir Thomas Maclear, published in 1866. Lacaille ’ 3 amplitude is verified, but
                    not his terrestrial measurement.</p>
                <p>The number of stations in the principal triangulation of Great Britain and
                    Irelaud is about 250. At 32 of these the latitudes were determined with
                    Ramsden’s and Airy’s zenith sectors. The theodolites used for this work were, in
                    addition to the two great theodolites of Ramsden which were used by General Roy
                    and Captain Kater (and which are now in as good condition as when they came from
                    the hands of the maker), a smaller theodolite of 18 inches diameter by the same
                    mechanician, and another of 24 inches diameter by Messrs Troughton and Simms.
                    Observations for determination of absolute azimuth were made with these
                    instruments at a large number of stations; the stars α, δ, and λ Ursae Minoris
                    and 51 Cephei being those observed, always at the greatest azimuths. At six of
                    these stations the probable error of the result is under 0" <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4, at twelve under 0" ’ 5, at thirty-four under 0"
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7: so that the absolute azimuth of the whole
                    network is determined with extreme accuracy. Of the seven base lines w hich have
                    been measured, five were by means of steel chains and two with Colby’s
                    compensation bars. This is a system of six compound bars self-correcting for
                    temperature. The compound bar may be thus described. Two bars, one of brass and
                    the other of iron, are laid side by side, parallel, and firmly united at their
                    centres, from which they are free to expand or contract; at the standard
                    temperature they are of the same length. Let AB be one bar, A ’ B' the other;
                    draw a line through the corresponding extremities A, A' to P, aud a line through
                    the other extremities B, B' to Q, make A'P = B'Q, AA' being = BB'. Now if A'P is
                    to AP as the rate of expansion of the bar A'B' to the rate of expansion of the
                    bar AB, then clearly the distance PQ will be invariable, or very nearly so. In
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n621/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0621-0600"/> the actual instrument P and Q are finely engraved
                    dots at the distance of 10 feet apart. In the measurement the bars when aligned
                    do not come into contact; an interval of six inches is left between each bar and
                    its neighbour. This small space is measured by an ingenious micrometrical
                    arrangement constructed on exactly the same principle as the bars themselves.
                    The triangulation was computed by least squares. The total number of equations
                    of condition for the triangulation is 920; if therefore the whole had been
                    reduced in one mass, as it should have been, the solution of an equation of 920
                    unknown quantities would have occurred as a part of the work. To avoid this an
                    approximation was resorted to; the triangulation was divided into twenty-one
                    parts or figures; four of these, not adjacent, were first adjusted by the method
                    explained, and the corrections thus determined in these figures carried into the
                    equations of condition of the adjacent figures. The average number of equations
                    in a figure is 44; the largest equation is one of 77 unknown quantities.<note

                <p>Airy’s Zenith Sector is too well known to need description. The vertical limb is
                    read by four microscopes; altogether, in the complete observation of a star
                    there are 10 micrometer readings and 12 level readings. In some recent
                    observations in Scotland for latitude the Zenith Telescope has been used with
                    very great success; it is very portable; and a complete determination of
                    latitude, affected with the mean of the declination errors of two stars, is
                    effected by two micrometer readings and four level readings. The observation
                    consists in measuring with the telescope micrometer the <hi rend="italic"
                    >difference</hi> of zenith distances of two stars which cross the meridian, one
                    to the north and the other to the south of the observer at zenith distances
                    which differ by not much more than 10' or 15', the interval of the times of
                    transit being not less than one nor more than twenty minutes. The advantages are
                    that, with simplicity in the construction of the instrument and facility in the
                    manipulation, refraction is eliminated (or nearly so, as the stars are generally
                    selected within 25° of the zenith), and there is no large divided circle. The
                    telescope, which is counterpoised on one side of the vertical axis, has a small
                    circle for finding, and there is also a small horizontal circle. This instrument
                    is universally used in American geodesy.</p>
                <p>The United States Coast Survey has a principal triangulation extending for about

                    of a vast amount of scientific labour and is the greatest contribution yet made
                    to the question of the figure of the earth. The latitudes of the thirteen
                    astronomical stations of this arc were determined partly with vertical circles
                    and partly by means of the transit instrument in the prime vertical. The
                    triangulation, a great part of which, however, is a simple chain of triangles,

                <p>Newton appears to have been the first to apply his own newly-discovered doctrine
                    of gravitation, combined with the so-called centrifugal force, to the question
                    of the figure of the earth. Assuming that an oblate ellipsoid of rotation is a
                    form of equilibrium for a homogeneous fluid rotating with uniform angular
                    velocity, he obtained the ratio of the axes 229: 230, and the law of variation
                    of gravity on the surface. A few years later Huyghens published an investigation
                    of the figure of the earth, supposing the attraction of every particle to be
                    towards the centre of the earth, obtaining as a result that the proportion of
                    the axes should be 578:579. In 1740 Maclaurin wrote his celebrated essay on the
                    tides, one of the most elegant geometrical investigations ever made. He
                    demonstrated that the oblate ellipsoid of revolution is a figure which satisfies
                    the conditions of equilibrium in the case of a revolving homogeneous fluid mass
                    whose particles attract one another according to the law of the inverse square
                    of the distance; he gave the equation connecting the ellipticity with the
                    proportion of the centrifugal force at the equator to gravity, and he determined
                    the attraction on a particle situated anywhere on the surface of such a body.
                    Some few years afterwards Clairaut published (1743) his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Théorie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Figure de la Terre,</hi> which contains,
                    among other results, demonstrated with singular elegance, a very remarkable
                    theorem which establishes a relation between the ellipticity of the earth and
                    the variations of gravity at different points of its surface. Assuming that the
                    earth is composed of concentric ellipsoidal strata having a common axis of
                    rotation, each stratum homogeneous in itself, but the ellipticities and
                    densities of the successive strata varying according to any law, and that the
                    superficial stratum has the same form as if it were fluid, he proves the very
                    important theorem contained in the equation <hi rend="italic">f-g .</hi> 5</p>
                <p>-—- <hi rend="superscript"> i,</hi> + e = <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ∙m, <hi

                <p>Where <hi rend="italic">g, f</hi> are the amouhts of gravity at the equator and
                    at the pole respectively, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the ellipticity of the
                    meridian, and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the ratio of the centrifugal force at the
                    equator to <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Clairaut also proved that the increase of
                    gravity in proceeding from the equator to the poles is as the square of the sine
                    of the latitude. This, taken with the former theorem, gives the means of
                    determining the earth ’ 3 ellipticity from observation of the comparative force
                    of gravity at any two places. Clairaut would seem almost to have exhausted the
                    subject, for although much has been written since by mathematicians of the
                    greatest eminence, yet, practically, very little of importance has been added.
                    Laplace, himself a prince of mathematicians, who had devoted much of his own
                    time to the same subject, remarks on Clairaut’s work that “the importance of all
                    his results and the elegance with which they are presented place this work
                    amongst the most beautiful of mathematical productions” (Todhunter’s <hi

                <p>The problem of the figure of the earth treated as a question of mechanics or
                    hydrostatics is one of great difficulty, and it would be quite impracticable but
                    for the circumstance that the surface differs but little from a sphere. In order
                    to express the forces at any point of the body arising from the attraction of
                    its particles, the form of the surface is required, but this form is the very
                    one which it is the object of the investigation to discover; hence the
                    complexity of the subject, and even with all the present resources of
                    mathematicians only a partial and imperfect solution can be obtained, and that
                    not without some labour. We may, however, here briefly indicate the line of
                    reasoning by which some of the most important of the results we <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n622/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0622-0601"/> have alluded to above may be obtained. The
                    principles of hydrostatics show us that if X, Y, Z be the components parallel to
                    three rectangular axes of the forces acting on a particle of a fluid mass at the
                    point <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> z, then, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being the
                    pressure there, and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the density, dp = p(Xdx + Υdy+
                    Zdz); and for equilibrium the necessary conditions are, that <hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> p</hi><hi rend="italic">(Xdx + Υdy + Zdx)</hi> be a complete
                    differential, and at the free surface <hi rend="italic">Xdx + Υdy</hi> + Zcfz =
                    0. This equation implies that the resultant of the forces is normal to the
                    surface at every point, and in a homogeneous fluid it is obviously the
                    differential equation of all surfaces of equal pressure. If the fluid be
                    heterogeneous then it is to be remarked that for forces of attraction according
                    to the ordinary law of gravitation, if X, Y, Z be the components of the
                    attraction of a mass whose potential is V, then <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi>,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> vj</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> 7j</hi> &lt;ilV <hi

                    t ,</hi> which is a complete differential. And in the case of a fluid rotating
                    with uniform velocity, in which the so-called centrifugal force enters as a
                    force acting on each particle proportional to its distance from the axis of
                    rotation, the corresponding part of <hi rend="italic">Xdx + Sidy</hi> + Z&lt;fe
                    is obviously a complete differential. Therefore for the forces with which we are
                    now concerned Xcfø +Y&lt;⅞∕ + ZcZz = &lt;7U, where U is some function of <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> and it is necessary for equilibrium that <hi
                    rend="italic">dp =</hi> pdU be a complete differential; that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> must be a function of U or a function of <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> and so also p a function of U. So that tZU = 0 is the differential
                    equation of surfaces of equal pressure and density.</p>
                <p>We may now show that a homogeneous fluid mass in the form of an oblate ellipsoid
                    of revolution having a uniform velocity of rotation can be in equilibrium. It
                    may be proved that the attraction of the ellipsoid z <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>This is the equation of an ellipsoid of rotation, and therefore the equilibrium

                <p>If we would determine the maximum value of ω from tiιis equation, we find that it

                <p>hence it may be shown that if the angular velocity exceed <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>that calculated from = 0'2247, equilibrium is impossible for the form of an

                    which satisfy the condition of equilibrium; in one of these the eccentricity is
                    greater and in the other less than 0 ’ 93. In the case of the earth, which is
                    nearly spherical, we get by expanding the expression for ω <hi

                    rejecting the higher powers, and remarking that the ellipticity e = ∣e <hi

                <p>Now, to come to the case of a heterogeneous fluid, we shall assume that its
                    surfaces of equal density are spheroids, concentric and having a common axis of
                    rotation, and that the ellipticity of these surfaces varies from the centre to
                    the outer surface, the den⅛ty also varying. In other words, the body is composed
                    m homogeneous spheroidal shells of variable density and ellipticity. On this
                    supposition we shall express the attraction of the mass upon a particle in its
                    interior, and then, taking into account the centrifugal force, form the equation
                    expressing the condition of fluid equilibrium. The attraction of the homogeneous

                    ellipticity, of which the square is neglected, on an internal particle, whose

                <p>The theory of the figure of the earth as a rotating ellipsoid has proved an
                    attractive subject to many of the greatest ma themati cans, Laplace especially,
                    who has devoted a large portion of his <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Celeste</hi> to it. In English the principal existing works on the
                    subject are Sir George Airy’s <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tracts,</hi> where
                    the subject is treated in the lucid style so characteristic of its author, but
                    without the use of Laplace’s coefficients, Archdeacon Pratt’s <hi rend="italic"

                    the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Transactions,</hi> vol. viii., is a valuable
                    essay by Professor Stokes, in which he proves, without making any assumption
                    whatever as to the ellipticity of internal strata, or as to the past or the
                    present fluidity of the earth that if the external form of the sea—imagined to
                    percolate the land by canals—be a spheroid with small ellipticity, then the law
                    of gravity will be that found above.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>An important theorem by Jacobi must not be overlooked. He proved that for a

                    and a certain time of revolution be a form of equilibrium.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In speaking of the figure of the earth, we mean the surface of the sea imagined
                    to percolate the continents by canals. That this surface should turn out, after
                    precise measurements, to be exactly an ellipsoid of revolution is <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> improbable. Although it may be highly probable that
                    originally the earth was a fluid mass, yet in the cooling whereby the present
                    crust has resulted, the actual solid surface has been left in form the most
                    irregular. It is clear that these irregularities of the visible surface must be
                    accompanied by irregularities in the mathematical figure of the earth, and when
                    we consider the general surface of our globe, its irregular distribution of
                    mountain masses, continents, with oceans and islands, we are prepared to admit
                    that the earth may not be precisely any surface of revolution. Nevertheless,
                    there must exist some spheroid which agrees very closely with the mathematical
                    figure of the earth, and has the same axis of rotation. We must conceive this
                    figure as exhibiting slight departures from the spheroid, the two surfaces
                    cutting one another in various lines; thus a point of the surface is defined by
                    its latitude, longitude, and its height above the spheroid of reference. Call
                    this height for a moment <hi rend="italic">η-,</hi> then of the actual magnitude
                    of this quantity we can generally have no information, it only obtrudes itself
                    on our notice by its variations. In the vicinity of mountains it may change sign
                    in the space of a few miles; <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being regarded as a
                    function of the latitude and longitude, if its differential coefficient with
                    respect to the former be zero at a certain point, the normals to the two
                    surfaces then will lie in the prime vertical; if the differential coefficient of
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> with respect to the longitude be zero, the two normals
                    will lie in the meridian; if both coefficients are zero, the normals will
                    coincide. The comparisons of terrestrial measurements with the corresponding
                    astronomical observations have ever been accompanied with discrepancies. Suppose
                    A and B to be two trigonometrical stations, and that at A there is a disturbing
                    force drawing the vertical through an angle δ, then it is evident that the
                    apparent zenith of A will be really that of some other place A', whose distance
                    from A is rδ, when <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the earth’s radius; and similarly
                    if there be a disturbance at B of the amount δ', the apparent zenith of B will
                    be really that of some other place B', whose distance from B is rδ'. Hence we
                    have the discrepancy that, while the geodetical measurements deal with the
                    points A and B, the astronomical observations belong to the points A', B'.
                    Should δ, δ' be equal and parallel, the displacements AA', BB' will be equal and
                    parallel, and no discrepancy will appear. The nonrecognition of this
                    circumstance often led to much perplexity in the early history of geodesy.
                    Suppose that, through the unknown variations of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> the
                    probable error of an observed latitude (that is, the angle between the normal to
                    the mathematical surface of the earth at the given point and that of the
                    corresponding point on the spheroid of reference) be e, then if we compare two
                    arcs of a degree <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0624-0603"/> each in mean latitudes, and near each other, say
                    about five degrees of latitude apart, the probable error of the resulting value
                    of the ellipticity will be approximately ± κ⅜σ&lt;, « being expressed in
                    seconds, so that if ∈ be so great as 2" the probable error of the resulting
                    ellipticity will be greater than the ellipticity itself. It is not only
                    interesting, but necessary at times, to calculate the attraction of a mountain,
                    and the consequent disturbance of the astronomical zenith, at any point within
                    its influence. The deflection of the plumb-line, caused by a local attraction
                    whose amount is Aδ, is measured by the ratio of <hi rend="italic">AS</hi> to the
                    force of gravity at the station. Expressed in seconds, the deflection Δ is</p>
                <p> Δ = 12".447.-A ,</p>
                <p>P</p>
                <p>where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the mean density of the earth, δ that of the
                    attracting mass,—the linear unit in expressing A being a mile. Suppose, for
                    instance, a table-land whose form is a rectangle of twelve miles by eight miles,
                    having a height of 500 feet and density half that of the earth; let the observer
                    be two miles distant from the middle point of the longer side. The deflection
                    then is Γ' ’ 472; but at one mile it increases to 2"∙20. At sixteen astronomical
                    stations in the English Survey the disturbance of latitude due to the form of
                    the ground has been computed, and the following will give an idea of the
                    results. At six stations the deflection is under 2", at six others it is between
                    2" and 4'', and at four stations it exceeds 4". There is one very exceptional
                    station on the north coast of Banffshire, near the village of Portsoy, at which
                    the deflection amounts to 10'', so that if that village were placed on a map in
                    a position to correspond with its astronomical latitude, it would be 1000 feet
                    out of position! There is the sea to the north and an undulating country to the
                    south, which, however, to a spectator at the station does not suggest any great
                    disturbance of gravity. A somewhat rough estimate of the local attraction from
                    external causes gives a maximum limit of 5", therefore we have 5" unaccounted
                    for, or rather which must arise from unequal density in the underlying strata in
                    the surrounding country. In order to throw light on this remarkable phenomenon,
                    the latitudes of a number of stations between Nairn on the west, Fraserburgh on
                    the east, and the Grampians on the south, were observed, and the local
                    deflections determined. It is somewhat singular that the deflections diminish in
                    all directions, not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> regularly certainly, and most
                    slowly in a south-west direction, finally disappearing, and leaving the maximum
                    at the original station at Portsoy.</p>
                <p>The method employed by Dr Hutton for computing the attraction of masses of ground
                    is so simple and effectual that it can hardly be improved on. Let a horizontal
                    plane pass through the given station; let <hi rend="italic">r, θ</hi> be the

                    with the station, intersected by radial lines so disposed that the sines of
                    their azimuths are in arithmetical progression. Then, having estimated from the
                    map the mean heights of the various compartments, the calculation is
                    obvious.</p>
                <p>In mountainous countries, as near the Alps and in the Caucasus, deflections have
                    been observed to the amount of as much as 29". On the other hand, deflections
                    have been observed in flat countries, such as that noted by Professor
                    Schweitzer, who has shown that, at certain stations in the vicinity of Moscow,
                    within a distance of 16 miles the plumb-line varies 16" in such a manner as to
                    indicate a vast deficiency of matter in the underlying strata. But these are
                    exceptional cases.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                    the mountain region beyond them, and the consequent deflection of the plumb-line
                    at various stations in India; the subject, which presents many anomalies and
                    difficulties, is very fully gone into in his treatise on the figure of the
                    earth. His computed deflections are vastly greater than anything brought to
                    light by observation.</p></note> Since the attraction of a mountain mass is
                    expressed as a numerical multiple of δ: <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the ratio of
                    the density of the mountain to that of the earth, if we have any independent

                    as, for instance, at Schiehallion, and more recently at Arthur’s Seat. A compact
                    mass of great density at a small distance under the surface of the earth will
                    produce an elevation of the mathematical surface which is expressed by the

                    the density of the earth, and the depth of its centre half a mile, the greatest
                    deflection would be 5", and the greatest value of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> only
                    two inches. Thus a large disturbance of gravity may arise from an irregularity

                    only amount to half an inch, whilst for a line of fifty miles it cannot exceed
                    the sixteenth part of an inch. The geodesic line joining P and Q lies wholly

                    designate by P', Q' the two curves (the former being that in the vertical plane

                    angles being a . third of the angle of intersection of P ’ and Q'. The

                <p>Cadiz (by “corresponding” we mean that F and G are on a meridian) then G is to
                    the north of F; at a quarter of the whole distance from Cadiz GF is 458 feet, at
                    half the distance<pb break="no"

                    feet. The azimuth of the geodesic at Cadiz differs 20" from that of the vertical
                    plane, which is the astronomical azimuth. The azimuth of a geodesic line cannot
                    be observed, so that the line does not enter of necessity into practical
                    geodesy, although many formjulae connected with its use are of great simplicity
                    and elegance. The geodesic line has always held a more important place in the
                    science of geodesy among the mathematicians of France, Germany, and Russia than
                    has been assigned to it in the operations of the English and Indian
                    triangulations. Although the observed angles of a triangulation are not geodesic
                    angles, yet in the calculation of the distance and reciprocal bearings of two
                    points which are far apart, and are connected by a long chain of triangles, we
                    may fall upon the geodesic line in this manner :—</p>
                <p> If A, Z be the points, then to start the calculation from A, we obtain by some
                    preliminary calculation the approximate azimuth of Z, or the angle made by the
                    direction of Z with the side AB or AC of the first triangle. Let P <hi rend="
                    subscript"> 1</hi> be the point where this line intersects BC; then, to find P,,
                    where the line cuts the next triangle side CD, we make the angle BP <hi rend="
                    subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend=" subscript"> 2</hi> such that BP <hi rend="
                    subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend=" subscript"> 2</hi> + BP <hi rend="
                    subscript"> 1</hi> A = 180 <hi rend=" superscript"> o</hi> . This fixes P <hi
                    rend=" subscript"> 2</hi> , and P <hi rend=" subscript"> 3</hi> is fixed by a
                    repetition of the same process; soforP <hi rend=" subscript"> 4</hi> , P <hi
                    rend=" subscript"> 8</hi> . . . · Now it is clear that the points P <hi rend="

                    3</hi> so computed are those which would be actually fixed by an observer with a
                    theodolite, proceeding in the following manner. Having set the instrument up at
                    A, and turned the telescope in the direction of the computed bearing, an
                    assistant places a mark P <hi rend=" subscript"> 1</hi> on the line BC,
                    adjusting it till bisected by the cross-hairs of the telescope at A. The
                    theodolite is then placed over P <hi rend=" subscript"> 1</hi> , and the
                    telescope turned to A; the horizontal circle is then moved through 180°. The
                    assistant then places a mark P <hi rend=" subscript"> 2</hi> on the line CD, so
                    as to be bisected by the telescope, which is then moved to P <hi rend="
                    subscript"> 2</hi> , and in the same manner P <hi rend=" subscript"> 3</hi> is
                    fixed. Now it is clear that the series of points P <hi rend=" subscript"> 1</hi>
                    , P <hi rend=" subscript"> 2</hi> , P <hi rend=" subscript"> 3</hi> approaches
                    to the geodesic line, for the plane of any two consecutive elements P <hi rend="

                <p>In combining a number of different arcs of meridian, with the view of determining

                    observed latitudes. Then, according to the method of least squares, those values

                    which render the sum of the squares of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the errors <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> a minimum. The corrections <hi rend="italic">x</hi> which
                    are here applied arise not from errors of observation only. The mere uncertainty
                    of a latitude, as determined with modern instruments, does not exceed a very
                    small fraction of a second as far as errors of observation go, but no accuracy
                    in observing will remove the error that may arise from local attraction. This,
                    as we have seen, may amount to some seconds, so that the corrections <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> to the observed latitudes are attributable to local
                    attraction. Archdeacon Pratt, in his treatise on the figure of the earth,
                    objects to this mode of applying least squares first used by Bessel; but
                    certainly Bessel was right, and the objection is groundless.</p>

                <p>In determining the figure of the earth from the arcs of meridian measured in

                    Clarke, C.B., R.E., on the further comparisons of the standards of Austria,
                    Spain, the United States, Cape of Good Hope, and Russia). These direct
                    comparisons, which were carried out with the highest attainable precision, are
                    of very great value. The length of the toise has three independent
                    determinations, viz., through the Russian standard double toise, the Prussian
                    toise, and the Belgium toise,—giving for the length of the toise, expressed in
                    terms of the standard yard of England <pb break="no"

                <p>„ „ Belgian „ 6 39453215 ft.</p>
                <p>By combining all the different comparisons made in England and on the Continent
                    on these bars, by the method of least squares, the final value of the toise is
                    6∙39453348 ft (log = 0‘8058088656), from which the greatest divergence of the
                    three separate results specified above is only half a millionth of a toise,
                    corresponding to ten feet in the earth’s radius. From the known ratio of the
                    toise and the metre, 864000: 443296, we get for the metre</p>
                <p>3∙28086933 ft. (log = 0'5159889356).</p>
                <p>That the close agreement between the determinations of the toise is not due to
                    chance will be seen from the fact that the comparisons of the Prussian toise
                    with the English standard involved 2340 micrometer readings and 520 thermometer
                    readings, extending over twenty-five days, the probable error of the resulting
                    length of the toise being ±0'00000015 yard. The probable error of the
                    determination of the Belgian toise is ÷ 0Ό0000027; that of the Russian double
                    toise ±0O0000031. With regard to tne metre, there is an independent
                    determination resulting from the comparison of the platinum metre of the Royal
                    Society,— a large number of observations giving for the length of the metre 3 ’
                    28087206 feet, which differs from the former result by about one millionth part.
                    But this determination, involving the expansion of the bar for 30° of
                    temperature, and being dependent on some old observations of Arago, cannot be
                    allowed any weight in modifying the result obtained through the toises. The
                    Russian standard, compared at Southampton, was that on which the length of their
                    base lines and therefore their whole arc depends.</p>

                <p>Having now stated the data of the problem, we may either seek that ellipsoid
                    which best represents the observations, or we may restrict the figure to one of
                    revolution. It will be convenient to commence with the supposition of an
                    ellipsoidal figure, as on so doing we can, by a slight alteration in the
                    equations of minimum, obtain also the required figure of revolution. It may be
                    remarked that, whatever the real figure may be, it is certain that if we
                    presuppose it an ellipsoid, the arithmetical process will bring out an
                    ellipsoid, which ellipsoid will agree better with all the observed latitudes
                    than any spheroid would, therefore we do not <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> that
                    it is an ellipsoid; to prove this, arcs of longitude would be required. There is
                    no doubt such arcs will be shortly forthcoming, but as yet they are not
                    available.</p>
                <p>The first thing that occurs to one in considering an ellipsoidal earth is the
                    question, What is a meridian curve 1 It may be defined in different ways: a
                    point moving on the surface in the direction astronomically determined as
                    “north” might be said to trace a meridian; or we may define it as the locus of
                    those points which have a constant longitude, whose zeniths lie in a great
                    circle of the heavens, having its poles in the equator; we adopt this
                    definition. Let <hi rend="italic">a, b, c</hi> be the semiaxes, c being the
                    polar semiaxis. The equation of the ellipsoid being</p>

                <p>Hence the equation to a “parallel” in which the latitude <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>

                <p>So that in an ellipsoidal earth the parallel is no longer a plane curve. Let
                    longitude be reckoned from the plane of <hi rend="italic">xz.</hi> As there are
                    two species of latitude, astronomical and geoeentric, so there are in the
                    ellipsoidal earth two species of longitude, geocentric (called «) and
                    astronomical (called ω). Conceive a line passing through the origin in the plane
                    of the equator and directed to a point whose longitude is ⅛π + ω. The direction
                    cosines of that line are—sin ω, cos <hi rend="italic">ω,</hi> and 0. Those
                    points of the surface whose normals are at right angles to this line are in the
                    meridian whose longitude is ω; the condition of perpendicularity is expressed by

                <p>The normal at P does not pass through the axis of rotation, so that the observed
                    latitudes on an ellipsoid are not exactly the quantities which should be used in
                    the ordinary method of expressing the length of a meridian arc in terms of the
                    latitudes. But it may be shown that this consideration may be neglected.</p>
                <p>The data we have collected form 35 equations between the 40 «-corrections to the
                    observed latitudes, and the four unknown quantities determining the elements of
                    the ellipsoid. Suppose n <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to be an approximate value

                <p>The meridian of the greater axis passes, in the Eastern Hemisphere, through
                    Spitzbergen, the Straits of Messina, Lake Chad in North Africa, and along the
                    west coast of South Africa,—nearly corresponding to the meridian which passes
                    over the greatest quantity of land in that hemisphere. In the Western Hemisphere
                    it passes through Behring’s Straits and through the centre of the Pacific Ocean.
                    The meridian (105° 34' E.) of the minor axis of the equator passes near
                    North-east Cape on the Arctic Sea, through Tong-king and the Straits of Sunda,
                    and corresponds nearly to the meridian which passes over the greatest amount of
                    land in Asia; and in the Western Hemisphere it passes through Smith Sound, the
                    west of Labrador, Montreal, between Cuba and Hayti, and along the west coast of
                    South America, nearly coinciding with the meridian that passes over the greatest
                    amount of land in that hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The length of the meridian quadrant passing through Paris, in the ellipsoidal
                    figure given above, is 10001472 ’ 5 metres, showing that the length of the ideal
                    French standard is considerably in error as representing the ten-millionth part
                    of the quadrant. The minimum quadrant, in longitude 105° 34', has a length of
                    10000024 ’ 5 metres. The probable error of the longitude of the major axis of
                    the equator given above is of course large, as much perhaps as ±15°.</p>
                <p>It has been objected to this figure of three unequal axes that it does not
                    satisfy, in the proportions of the axes, the conditions brought out in Jacobi’s
                    theorem. Admitting this, it has to be noted, on the other hand, that Jacobi’s
                    theorem contemplates a homogeneous fluid, and this is certainly far from the
                    actual condition of our globe, indeed, the irregular distribution of continents
                    and oceans suggests as possible a sensible divergence from a perfect surface of
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>If we limit the figure to being an ellipsoid of revolution, we get rid in our
                    equations of two unknown quantities, and the result may be expressed thus :—</p>
                <p>Feet. Metres.</p>
                <p>α = 20926062 = 6378206∙4</p>

                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 98.</p>
                <p>As might be expected, the sum of the squares of the 40 latitude corrections,
                    viz., 153’99, is greater in this figure than in that of three axes, where it
                    amounts to 138 ’ 30. In the Indian arc the largest corrections are at
                    Dodagoontah, + 3"∙87, and at Kalianpur, -3" ’ 68. In the Russian arc the largest
                    corrections are + 3" ’ 76, at Tornea, and - 3" <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    31, at Staro Nekrassowka. Of the whole 40 corrections, 16 are under 1"O,10
                    between 1" ’ 0 and 2".0, 10between 2"O and 3"O, and 4 over 3"O. For the
                    ellipsoidal figure the probable error of an observed latitude is ± 1" ’ 42; for
                    the spheroidal it would be very slightly larger. This quantity may be taken
                    therefore as approximately the probable amount of local deflection.</p>
                <p>In 1860, the Russian Government, at the instance of M. Otto Struve, imperial
                    astronomer at St Petersburg, invited the co-operation of the Governments of
                    Prussia, Belgium, France, and England, to the important end of connecting their
                    respective triangulations so as to form a continuous chain under the parallel of
                    52° from the island of Valentia on the south-west coast of Ireland, in longitude
                    10° 20' 40" W., to Orsk on the river Ural in Russia. This grand undertaking was
                    at once set in action, but up to the present <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n629/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0629-0608"/> time there are portions of the work still
                    incomplete. On the part of England the triangulation was, in 1862, carried
                    through France into Belgium; and the difference of longitude of Greenwich and
                    Valentia was determined by the Astronomer Royal by means of electric telegraph
                    signals.</p>
                <p>Although in theory the determination of differences of longitude by electric
                    telegraph signals may appear ext remely simple, yet practically there are very
                    many sources of error which have to be sought out and eliminated by a proper
                    arrangement of the observations. The system has now been brought to such
                    perfection that the astronomical amplitude of arcs of longitude can be
                    determined with nearly as much accuracy as those of latitude, and in a few years
                    the data of the problem of the figure of the earth will thus receive many
                    additions. As an example of the precision arrived at, the difference of
                    longitude of Greenwich Observatory and Harvard Observatory, U.S.A., has been
                    three times determined with the following results :—</p>

                <p>But the different determinations of the velocity of transmission of signals
                    present great anomalies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pendulum Observations.</hi></p>
                <p>In Clairaut’s theorem we have seen that if <hi rend="italic">f</hi> be gravity in
                    the latitude of &lt;∕&gt;, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> its value at the equator,
                    then ∕ = &lt;7(1+ &lt;7 sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> φ). If the same
                    pendulum be swung in different latitudes then the square of the number of
                    vibrations will be proportional to gravity. Hence, if N be the number of
                    vibrations of an invariable pendulum per diem at the equator, N' the number in
                    latitude &lt;∕&gt;, then N' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = N <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (1 + <hi rend="italic">q</hi> sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> φ). Thus <hi rend="italic">q</hi> can be obtained by
                    observations on the same pendulum in different latitudes, and since <hi
                    rend="italic">q — ^m-e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is known, <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> will at once follow. The pendulum which makes 86400
                    oscillations per diem in London is observed to lose 136 vibrations at the
                    equator and gain 79 at Spitzbergen.</p>
                <p>The limits of space at our disposal here prevent our going into the subject of
                    pendulum experiments, and it seems unnecessary to repeat the investigations that
                    have already been based upon the older pendulum observations. See Airy’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Figure of the Earth,</hi> Baily’s paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society,</hi> General Sabine’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Account of Experiments to determine the Figure of the Earth by
                    means of the Pendulum vibrating seconds in Different Latitudes,</hi> 1825, and a
                    valuable paper in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> 1849, by Professor Stokes. The pendulum gives an ellipticity
                    certainly somewhat greater than that resulting from arcs of meridian, viz., -
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-g⅛.- <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>-. An immense
                    number of pendulum observations are now being made at the astronomical stations
                    of geodesical surveys in Germany, Russia, and India, which, when fully
                    published, will throw light more perhaps upon the local variations of gravity
                    than on the figure of the earth. The observations made at the various stations
                    of the Indian meridian arc bring to light a physical fact of the very highest
                    importance and interest, namely, that the density of the strata of the earth’s
                    crust under and in the vicinity of the Himalayan Mountains is less than that
                    under the plains to the south, the deficiency increasing as the stations of
                    observation approach the Himalayas, and being a maximum when they are situated
                    on the range itself. This accounts fer the non-appearance of the large
                    deflections which the Himalayas, according to Archdeacon Pratt’s calculations,
                    ought to produce. The Indian pendulum observations also throw some light on the
                    relative variations of gravity at continental, coast, and island stations,
                    showing that, without a single exception, gravity at the coast stations is
                    greater than at the corresponding continental stations, and greater at island
                    stations than at coast stations. The ellipticity of the earth has also been
                    deduced from the motion of the moon, the quantity <hi rend="italic">e-⅛m</hi>
                    entering as a coefficient_in the expression for the moon’s latitude. The
                    resulting value of the ellipticity is ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th (Airy’s <hi rend="italic">Tracts,</hi> p. 188). A
                    value of the ellipticity may also be derived from the precession of the
                    equinoxes, but as this depends on the assumed law of density in the interior of
                    the earth it is not of much importance.</p>
