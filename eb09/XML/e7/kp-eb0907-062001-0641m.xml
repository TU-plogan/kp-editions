                <p>Écarté is generally played by two persons, but a pool of three may be formed, the
                    player who is out taking the place of the loser, and the winner of two
                    consecutive games winning the pool. At French écarté (but not at English)
                    bystanders who are betting may advise the players, by pointing to the cards they
                    desire them to play, and the loser of the game goes out and one of the <hi
                    rend="italic">rentrants</hi> takes his place, unless the loser is playing <hi
                    rend="italic">la chouette</hi><hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> taking all the bets
                    that are offered), when he does not have to resign his seat if he loses.</p>
                <p>A pack of cards is used from which the small cards (from the two to the six both
                    inclusive) are removed. The players cut for deal, the highest having the choice.
                    The dealer gives five cards to his adversary and five to himself, by two at a
                    time to each and by three at a time to each, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The eleventh card is turned up for trumps. If it is a king, the
                    dealer scores one.</p>
                <p>The non-dealer then looks at his cards If satisfied with them he plays, and there
                    is no <hi rend="italic">discarding;</hi> if not satisfied he <hi rend="italic"
                    >proposes.</hi> The dealer may either <hi rend="italic">accept</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">refuse.</hi> If he accepts each player discards face downwards as
                    many cards as he thinks fit, and fresh ones are given from the undealt cards or
                    <hi rend="italic">stock,</hi> first to complete the non-dealer’s hand to five,
                    then to complete the dealer’s. Similarly, a second proposal may be made, and so
                    on, until one player is satisfied with his hand. If the dealer refuses the hand
                    is played without discarding.</p>
                <p>If the non-dealer announces that he holds the king of trumps, he scores one; and
                    similarly, if the dealer holds the king and announces it, he scores one.</p>
                <p>The non-dealer, being satisfied with his hand, leads a card. The dealer plays a
                    card to it, the two cards thus played forming a <hi rend="italic">trick.</hi>
                    The winner of the trick leads to the next, and so on. The highest card of the
                    suit led wins, the cards ranking king (highest), queen, knave, ace, ten, nine,
                    eight, seven. Trumps win other suits. The second to play to a trick must follow
                    suit if able, and must win the trick if he can, whether by trumping or
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>The scores are for the king (as already explained), and for the majority of
                    tricks. The player who wins three tricks scores one for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >point;</hi> if he wins all five tricks, he scores two for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vole.</hi> If the non-dealer plays without proposing, or the dealer refuses the
                    first proposal, and fails to win three tricks, the adversary scores two, but no
                    more even if he wins the vole. The game is five up.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hints to Players.</hi> —The following hints, which merely
                    touch on the elements of the play, may be of service to beginners :—</p>
                <p>Shuffle thoroughly after every deal to prevent the cards packing in suits,
                    otherwise the tramp card is not unlikely to be of the same suit as those
                    preceding it, which are in the dealer’s hand. It is an act of courtesy to the
                    adversary to shuffle your own pack well, to save him the trouble of making your
                    cards.</p>
                <p>Do not look at your hand when dealer, until after the non-dealer has decided
                    whether he will propose or not. The countenance or manner, often betrays the
                    nature of the hand.</p>
                <p>Do not announce the king until in the act of playing your first card.</p>
                <p>Propose quickly, as hesitation exposes the nature of the hand. In order to be
                    quick, the hands which should be played without proposing, called <hi
                    rend="italic">jeux de règle,</hi> ought to be thoroughly known. They are as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>1. All hands with <hi rend="italic">three trumps,</hi> whatever the other
                    cards.</p>
                <p>2. Hands with <hi rend="italic">two trumps</hi> which contain also—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">α.</hi> Any three cards of one plain suit; <hi rend="italic"
                    >b.</hi> Two cards of one plain suit, one being as high as a queen; c. Two small
                    cards of one suit, the fifth card being a king of another suit; <hi
                    rend="italic">d.</hi> Hands intermediate between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">c, i.e.,</hi> with higher cards in one plain suit, and lower
                    in another, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> two trumps, knave, ace of one suit, and
                    nine or eight of another; or ace, ten of one suit, and ten of another; or ten,
                    nine of one suit, and knave of another; <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Three cards of
                    different suits, as high as king, knave, and a small card, or cards of equal
                    value in different suits, as king, ace, nine; or king, and two tens; or two
                    queens; or queen, knave, ace; or three knaves.</p>
                <p>3. Hands with <hi rend="italic">one trump,</hi> which contain also—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> King, queen, knave of one suit, and a small card of
                    another; <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Four cards of one suit headed by king; c.
                    Three cards of one suit headed by queen, and queen of another suit.</p>
                <p>4. Hands with <hi rend="italic">no trump,</hi> which contain three queens or
                    cards of equal value in different suits, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> four court
                    cards.</p>
                <p>5. Hands from which only two cards can be discarded without throwing a king or a
                    trump.</p>
                <p>Holding cards which make the point certain, propose, as you have the chance of a
                    refusal, and one good card taken in may give you the vole. If you hold a <hi
                    rend="italic">jeu de règle,</hi> and one of the trumps is the king, it is
                    generally right to propose, as your adversary, if he accepts, cannot then take
                    the king. But, except in the case of the king, the value of the tramps does not
                    affect the proposal hands, as the game is not to lead trumps originally (without
                    the king), unless you have three, but to keep them for trumping, and for this
                    purpose high trumps are no betteι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> than low
                    ones.</p>
                <p>When discarding, throw out all cards except trumpsand kings.</p>
                <p>If your adversary proposes you should accept, unless you are guarded in three
                    suits (a queen being a sufficient guard), or in two suits with a trump, or in
                    one suit with two tramps. Hence the rule not to discard two cards, unless
                    holding the king of tramps, applies to the dealer.</p>
                <p>The hands with which to refuse are the same as those with which to play without
                    proposing, except as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Two trumps and three cards of one plain suit should not be played unless the
                    plain suit is headed by a court card.</p>
                <p>2. One trump and a tierce major is too weak, unless the fifth card is a court
                    card. With similar hands weaker in the tierce major suit, accept unless the
                    fifth card is a queen.</p>
                <p>3. One tramp and four cards of a plain suit is too weak to play.</p>
                <p>4. One trump and two queens is too weak, unless both queens are singly
                    guarded.</p>
                <p>5. One trump, queen of one suit, and knave guarded of another should not be
                    played unless the queen is also guarded, or the card of the fourth suit is a
                    court card.</p>
                <p>6. One trump, a king and a queen, both unguarded, should not be played, unless
                    the fourth suit contains a card as high as an ace.</p>
                <p>7. Four court cards without a trump are too weak to play, unless they are of
                    three different suits.</p>
                <p>Befuse with three queens, if two are singly guarded; otherwise, accept.</p>
                <p>Lead from your guarded suit, and lead the highest. An exception to this rule is
                    with two small trumps, a guarded queen, and a small card of another suit, when
                    the single card should be led.</p>
                <p>When playing a weak hand after a refusal, with no hope of the point and fear of
                    losing the vole, lead the strongest single card, unless you have a king.</p>
                <p>If the strong suit led is not trumped, persevere with it, unless with king of
                    tramps, or queen (king not having been announced), or knave, ace, when lead a
                    trump before continuing your suit. Also, when playing for the vole with a weak
                    trump and high cards, change the suit each time to avoid a ruff. Having made
                    three tricks, then lead the trump.</p>
                <p>You should not lead tramps at starting, even if your best suit, unless you hold
                    king, or queen, knave, or knave, ace, with court cards out of trumps. Holding
                    three trumps, the two best being in sequence, lead a trump.</p>
                <p>If cards are refused, it is better to lead from two small cards in sequence, than
                    from a high tenace.</p>
                <p>If you have won two tricks, your opponent one, and you hold a trump and a plain
                    card, lead the plain card; but if your adversary has won two tricks and you win
                    the third, lead the trump.</p>
                <p>If you make two tricks and have the queen and two small trumps (the king having
                    been announced against you), by leading a small trump you must win the
                    point.</p>
                <p>The score has to be considered. If the dealer is at four, and the king is not in
                    your hand nor turned up, play any cards without proposing which give an even
                    chance of three tricks, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a queen, a guarded knave,
                    and a guarded ten. The same rule applies to the dealer’s refusal, but he ought
                    to be protected in three suits, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> three knaves, or a
                    knave and two guarded tens. At the adverse <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0642-0621"/> score of four, and king not being in hand or
                    turned up, any hand with one trump should be played, unless the plain cards are
                    very small and of different suits. Further, the rule to ask for cards with the
                    point certain does not hold at the adverse score of four, unless king is in hand
                    or turned up.</p>
                <p>If the non-dealer plays without proposing when he is four to three, and the
                    dealer holds the king he ought not to mark it. The same rule applies to the
                    non-dealer after a refusal, if the dealer is four to three.</p>
                <p>At the score of non-dealer three, dealer four, the dealer should refuse on
                    moderate cards, as the player proposing at this score must have a very bad
                    hand.</p>
                <p>At four a forward game should not be played in trumps, as there is no advantage
                    in winning the vole.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Laws of</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Écarté.</hi> —The following
                    laws are abridged from the revised code adopted by the Turf Club :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Culling.—</hi> 1. A cut must consist of at least two cards.
                    Card exposed in cutting, fresh cut. <hi rend="italic">Dealing.—</hi> 2. Order of
                    distribution of cards, whether by three and two, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa,</hi> once selected, dealer must not change it during game. If changed, or
                    wrong number of cards dealt, non-dealer, before he looks at his hand, may claim
                    fresh deal. 3. Dealer turning up more than one card, non-dealer, before looking
                    at his hand, may select either for trump, or may claim fresh deal. If he has
                    looked at his hand there must be a fresh deal. 4. Faced card discovered in pack
                    before trump card is turned, fresh deal. 5. Dealer exposing own cards in
                    dealing, no penalty; exposing non-dealer’s cards, non-dealer, before looking at
                    his hand, has option of fresh deal. 6. Deal out of turn, discovered before trump
                    turned up, void; after, too late to rectify. 7. Misdeal discovered after trump
                    card turned, and before proposing or playing, non-dealer has option of fresh
                    deal. If deal stands, dealer cannot mark king turned up, and non-dealer having
                    superfluous cards discards them; dealer having superfluous cards, non-dealer
                    draws and looks at them; either having too few cards, hand is completed from
                    stock. 8. Either player playing with wrong number of cards, adversary has option
                    of fresh deal. <hi rend="italic">Marking king.—</hi> 9. King turned up may be
                    marked any time before trump card of next deal is turned; king in hand must be
                    announced before playing first card, or if king is card first led by non-dealer
                    before being played to, or cannot be marked; if king is card first played by
                    dealer, it must be announced before he plays again. 10. Player announcing king
                    when he has not got it, and playing a card without declaring error, adversary
                    may correct score and have hand played over again. If oflender wins point or
                    vole that hand, he scores one less than he wins. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proposing.—</hi> 11. Proposal, acceptance, or refusal made cannot be retracted.
                    <hi rend="italic">Discarding.—</hi> 12. Cards discarded must not be looked at.
                    13. Either player taking too many cards, and mixing any with his hand, adversary
                    may claim fresh deal. If deal stands, adversary draws superfluous cards, and may
                    look at them if offender has seen any of the cards given. Non-dealer asking for
                    less cards than he discards, dealer counts as tricks all cards that cannot be
                    played to. Same rule for dealer, but if he discovers error before playing a
                    card, he may complete hand from stock. 14. Dealer giving more or less cards than
                    a⅛ked for, non-dealer may claim fresh deal. If deal stands, non-dealer with too
                    many cards discards superfluous ones'; with too few, has hand completed from
                    stock. 15. Faced card in stock after discarding, players may look at it; it is
                    put aside and next card given. 16. Cards exposed in giving cards to non-dealer,
                    he has option of taking them or of having next cards; dealer exposing his own
                    cards, no penalty. 17. Dealer turning up top card after giving cards, cannot
                    refuse second discard. 18. Dealer accepting when too few cards in stock to
                    supply both, non-dealer may take cards, and dealer must play his hand. <hi
                    rend="italic">Playing.—</hi> 19. Card led in turn cannot be taken up again. Card
                    played to a lead can only be taken up prior to another lead, to save revoke or
                    to correct error of not winning trick. Card led out of turn may be taken up
                    i&gt;rior to its being played to. 20. Player naming one suit and eading another,
                    adversary has option of requiring suit named to be led. If offender has none, no
                    penalty. 21. Player abandoning hand, adversary is deemed to win remaining
                    tricks, and scores accordingly. <hi rend="italic">Revoking, and not winning
                    trick.—</hi> 22. For either of these offences same penalty as in law 10. <hi

                    preceding deals good. <hi rend="italic">Bystanders.—</hi> 24. If players declare
                    to play English écarté, bystanders, betting or not, not allowed to make remarks
                    or give advice, nor to play out game of player resigning. If bystander makes
                    remark which affects score, player prejudiced may call on him to pay his stakes
                    and bets. 25. At French écarté, those betting may correct score, give advice (by
