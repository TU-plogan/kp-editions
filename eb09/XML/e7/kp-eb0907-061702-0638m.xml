                    educated partly at home and partly in his father’s school. In the seventeenth
                    year of his age he went to the university of Halle to study theology. Towards
                    the end of 1759 he returned to his native town, and became tutor to the eldest
                    son of the Baron Von der Horst, to whose family he attached himself for a number
                    of years. In 1763 he was appointed con-rector of the school of St Martin’s, and
                    second preacher in the Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost; but he soon afterwards
                    resigned these offices, and followed his patron to Berlin. The advantage he
                    enjoyed of being introduced by the baron into the best company tended to polish
                    his manners, and to form, even at an early period, a style of writing which
                    served as a model to many of his contemporaries. His residence at Berlin gave
                    him an opportunity of extending his knowledge, and of cultivating the
                    acquaintance of some of the most eminent literary men in Germany. Amongst these
                    were Nicolai and Moses Mendelssohn, with whom he associated upon terms of
                    intimate friendship.</p>
                <p>In 1768 he accepted the situation of preacher or chaplain to the workhouse at
                    Berlin, along with that of preacher in the neighbouring fishing village of
                    Stralow. The income from these livings was small; but his object was to continue
                    at Berlin, and he had at the same'time the promise of further preferment upon
                    the first vacancy. He now applied with renewed ardour to the study of theology,
                    philosophy, and history, the first fruits of which soon appeared in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Neue Apologie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Socrates</hi> (1772), a
                    work occasioned by an attack which was made on the sentiments contained in the
                    fifteenth chapter of Marmontel’s <hi rend="italic">Belisarius</hi> by Peter
                    Hofstede, a clergyman of Rotterdam, who, with a misdirected industry, raked up
                    the vices of the most celebrated characters in the pagan world, and maintained
                    the patristic view that even their virtues were only <hi rend="italic">splendida
                    peccata.</hi> Eberhard stated the arguments for the broader view with great
                    acuteness and learning, and is therefore entitled to rank as one of the founders
                    of rationalistic theology in Germany. The <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> itself,
                    which constitutes but a small part of the book, is esteemed a master-piece of
                    clear, dignified, and persuasive eloquence. The whole work exhibits much reading
                    and philosophical reflection; but the liberality of his reasoning gave great
                    offence to many of the strictly orthodox divines of his time, and is believed to
                    have obstructed his preferment in the church.</p>
                <p>In 1774 he was appointed to the living of Charlottenburg; and he employed the
                    leisure he had in this situation in preparing a second volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology,</hi> which appeared in 1778. In this he not only
                    endeavours to obviate some objections which were taken to the former part, but
                    continues his inquiries into the doctrines of the Christian religion, religious
                    toleration, and the proper rules for interpreting the Scriptures. Perceiving
                    that his further promotion in the church would be attended with difficulty, he
                    resolved, although reluctantly, to accept the situation of professor of
                    philosophy at the university of Halle, which became vacant in 1778 by the death
                    of G. F. Moier. As an academical teacher, however, he was unsuccessful. His
                    powers as an original thinker were not equal to his learning and his literary
                    gifts, as was shown in his opposition to the philosophy of Kant.</p>
                <p>On his arrival at Halle, the philosophical faculty presented him with a diploma
                    as doctor in philosophy and master of arts. In 1786 he was admitted a member of
                    the Berlin Academy of Sciences; and in 1805 the king of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0639-0618"/> Prussia conferred upon him the honorary title of
                    a privycouncillor. In 1808 he obtained the degree of doctor in divinity, which
                    was given him as a reward for his theological writings. He died January 6,
                    1809.</p>
                <p>Eberhard’s attainments in philosophy and literature were extensive and profound.
                    He was master of the learned languages, spoke and wrote French with facility and
                    correctness, and understood English, Italian, and Dutch. He bad read a great
                    deal, was thoroughly versed in the philosophical sciences, and possessed a just
                    and discriminating taste for the fine arts. He was a great lover of music, and
                    was himself a proficient in.the art.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of his works :— <hi rend="italic">Neue Apologie</hi><hi

                    Germany; <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeichen der

                    1795-1802, 6 vols. 8vo, long reckoned the best work on the synonyms of the
                    German language (an abridgment of it was published by the author in one large
                    volume 8vo, Halle, 1802); <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aesthetik,</hi> &amp;c., Halle, 1803-1805, 4 vols. 8vo. Besides the works above
                    mentioned, Eberhard contributed a number of small tracts and essays to various
                    periodical and scientific publications, and translated several foreign works. He
                    was also the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> Halle,
                    1788— 1792, and of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Archives,</hi> Halle,
                    1793-1795. These two periodical works, which are now little read, were
                    instituted for the purpose of controverting the metaphysical principles of Kant,
                    and of vindicating the doctrines of Leibnitz and Wolf. Frederick Nicolai
                    published a memoir on the life and character of Eberhard, Berlin and Stettin,
                    1810, 8vo. See also K. H. Jordens, <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi
