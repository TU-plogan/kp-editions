                    (1693—1773), a celebrated antiquarian and ornithologist, was born at Stratford,
                    in Essex, on the 3d April 1693. He was originally apprenticed to a tradesman in
                    Fenchurch Street, London; but obtaining by accident access to a number of books
                    on natural history, painting, astronomy, and antiquities, he lost his
                    inclination for mercantile pursuits, and acquired a desire for foreign travel.
                    In 1716 he visited the principal towns in Holland, and two years afterwards
                    travelled in Norway and Sweden. In 1719 he went to Paris for the purpose of
                    studying its natural history collections, and during his stay in France he made
                    two journeys of a hundred miles each, the first to Chalons in Champagne, and the
                    second on foot to Orleans and Blois. On his arrival in England he closely
                    pursued his favourite study of natural history, applying himself to drawing and
                    colouring such animals as fell under his notice. Birds first engaged his
                    particular attention, and having purchased some of the best pictures of them, he
                    made a few drawings of his own, which were admired by the curious, who
                    encouraged the young naturalist by paying a good price for his early labours. In
                    1731 lie made an excursion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected several
                    scarce books and prints, and had an opportunity of examining the original
                    pictures of several great masters, at Antwerp, Brussels, Utrecht, and other
                    cities. In December 1733, by the recommendation of Sir Hans Sloane, the
                    president of the college of physicians, he was chosen librarian to that body,
                    and had apartments assigned him in the college. Here he had the opportunity of a
                    constant recourse to a valuable library filled with scarce and curious books on
                    the subject of natural history, which he so assiduously studied. By degrees he
                    became one of the most eminent ornithologists in his own or any other country.
                    He published the first volume of the <hi rend="italic">History of Birds</hi> in
                    1743, a second volume in 1747, a third in 1750, and a fourth in 1751. In 1758 he
                    continued his labours under a new title, that of <hi rend="italic">Gleanings of
                    Natural History.</hi> A second volume of the gleanings was published in 1760,
                    and a third in 1764. The two works contain engravings and descriptions of more
                    than six hundred subjects in natural history not before described or delineated.
                    He likewise added a general index in French and English, which was afterwards
                    perfected with the Linnaean names by Linnaeus himself, who frequently honoured
                    him with his friendship and correspondence. In 1750 he received the gold medal
                    of the Royal Society, given annually on St Andrew’s day to the author of any new
                    discovery in art or nature. He was, a few years afterwards, elected fellow of
                    the Royal Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries, London, and also a member
                    of many of the academies of sciences and learning in different parts of Europe.
                    After the publication of his last work, having arrived at his seventieth year,
                    and finding his sight beginning to fail, and his hand losing its wonted
                    steadiness, he retired from public employment to a little house which he had
                    purchased at Plaistow. The conversation of a few select friends, and the perusal
                    of a few select books, were the amusement of the evening of his life; and now
                    and then he made an excursion to some of the principal cities in England,
                    particularly to Bristol, Bath, Exeter, and Norwich. His general health began to
                    fail some years before his death, which took place on the July 23, 1773.</p>
