                    writings attributed to Snorri Sturluson (1178— 1241), a scholar of Jon Löftssön,
                    and the greatest name in old Scandinavian literature. It is believed that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> as he left it, was completed about 1222. Whether he
                    gave this name to the work is doubtful; the title first occurs in the Upsala
                    Codex, transcribed about fifty years after 1rs death. The collection of Snorri
                    is now known as the <hi rend="italic">Prose</hi><pb break="no"

                    Sveinsson, in 1643, and erroneously named by him the <hi rend="italic">Edda of

                <p>1. The Prose <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> properly known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edda Snorra Sturlusoηar,</hi> was arranged and modified by Snorri, but actually
                    composed, as has been conjectured, between the years 1140 and 1160. It is
                    divided into five parts, the Preface or <hi rend="italic">Formali,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gylfaginning, Bragarce∂</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">ur,
                    Skaldskaparmal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hattatal.</hi> The preface bears a
                    very modern character, and simply gives a history of the world from Adam and
                    Eve, in accordance with the Christian tradition. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gylfaginηing,</hi> or the Delusion of Gylfi, on the other hand, is the most
                    precious compendium which we possess of the mythological system of the ancient
                    inhabitants of Scandinavia. Commencing with the adventures of a mythical king
                    Gylfi and the giantess Gefion, and the miraculous formation of the island of
                    Zealand, it tells us that the Aesir, led by Odin, invaded Svithjod or Sweden,
                    the land of Gylfi, and settled there. It is from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yngliηgasaga</hi> and from the <hi rend="italic">Gylfaginning</hi> that we gain
                    all the information we possess about the conquering deities or heroes who set
                    their stamp upon the religion of the North. Advancing from the Black Sea
                    northwards through Russia, and westward through Esthonia, the Aesir seem to have
                    overrun the south lands of Scandinavia, not as a horde but as an immigrant
                    aristocracy. The Eddaic version, however, of the history of the gods is not so
                    circumstantial as that in the <hi rend="italic">Ynglingasaga;</hi> it is, on the
                    other hand, distinguished by an exquisite simplicity and archaic force of style,
                    which give an entirely classical character to itg mythical legends of Odin and
                    of Loki. The <hi rend="italic">Gylfaginning</hi> is written in prose, with brief
                    poetic insertions. The <hi rend="italic">Bragarce∂~ur,</hi> or sayings of Bragi,
                    are further legends of the deities, attributed to Bragi, the god of poetry, or
                    to a poet of the same name. The <hi rend="italic">Skaldskaparmdl,</hi> or Art of
                    Poetry, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Skdlda,</hi> contains the instructions
                    given by Bragi to Aegir, and consists of the rules and theories of ancient
                    verse, exemplified in copious extracts from Eyvindr SkMdaspillir and other
                    eminent Icelandic poets. The word <hi rend="italic">Skâldskapr</hi> refers to
                    the form rather than the substance of verse, and this treatise is almost solely
                    technical in character. It is by far the largest of the sections of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda</hi> of Snorri, and comprises not only extracts but some long
                    poems, notably the <hi rend="italic">Thorsdrapa</hi> of Eilifr GuÔrûnarson and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Haustlaung</hi> of ThjôÔôlfr. The fifth section of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Hattataf</hi> or Number of
                    Metres, is a running technical commentary on the text of Snorri’s three poems
                    written in honour of Hakon, king of Norway. Affixed to some MS. of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Younger Edda</hi> are a list of poets, and a number of
                    philological treatises and grammatical studies. These belong, however, to a
                    later period than the life of Snorri Sturluson.</p>
                <p>The three oldest MSS. of the prose <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi> all belong to the
                    beginning of the 14th century. The Wurm MS. was sent to Ole Wurm in 1628; the
                    Codex Regius was discovered by the indefatigable bishop Brynjulf Sveinsson in
                    1640. The most important, however, of these MSS. is the Upsala Codex, an octavo
                    volume written probably about the year 1300. There have been several good
                    editions of the <hi rend="italic">Edda Snorra Sturlusonar,</hi> of which perhaps
                    the best is that published by the Arne-Magnaean Society in Copenhagen in 1848,
                    in two vols., edited by a group of scholars under the direction of Jon
                    Sigurdsson.</p>
                <p>2. The Elder <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> Poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Saemundar Edda hins fro∂a</hi> was entirely unknown until
                    about 1643, when it came into the hands of Brynjulf Sveinsson, who, puzzled to
                    classify it, gave it the title of <hi rend="italic">Edda Scemundi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">multiscii.</hi> Saemund feigfusson, who was thus credited with the
                    collection of these poems, was a scion of the royal house of Norway, and lived
                    from about 1055 to 1132 in Iceland. The poems themselves date in all probability
                    from the 8th or 9th centuries, and are many of them only fragments of longer
                    heroic chants now otherwise entirely lost. They treat of mythical and religious
                    legends of an early Scandinavian civilization, and are composed in the simplest
                    and most archaic forms of Icelandic verse. The author of no one of them is
                    mentioned. It is evident that they were collected from oral tradition; and the
                    fact that the same story is occasionally repeated, in varied form, and that some
                    of the poems themselves bear internal evidence of being more ancient than
                    others, proves that the present collection is only a gathering made early in the
                    Middle Ages, long after the composition of the pieces, and in no critical
                    spirit. Sophus Bugge, indeed, one of the greatest living authorities, absolutely
                    rejects the name of Saemund, and is of opinion that the poetic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edda,</hi> as we at present hold it, dates from about 1240. There is no doubt
                    that it was collected in Iceland, and by an Icelander.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable and the most ancient of the poems in this priceless
                    collection is that with which it commences, the <hi rend="italic">Voluspa,</hi>
                    or Prophecy of the Völva or Sibyl. In this chant we listen to an inspired
                    prophetess, “seated on her high seat, and addressingθdin, while the gods listen
                    to her words.” She sings of the world before the gods were made, of the coming
                    and the meeting of the Aesir, of the origin of the giants, dwarfs, and men, of
                    the happy beginning of all things, and the sad ending that shall be in the chaos
                    of Ragnarök. The latter part of the poem is understood to be a kind of
                    necromancy,—according to Vigfusson, “the raising of a dead völva;” but the
                    mystical language of the whole, its abrupt transitions and terse condensations,
                    and above all the extinct and mysterious cosmology, an acquaintance with which
                    it presupposes, make the exact interpretation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voluspa</hi> extremely difficult. The charm and solemn beauty of the style,
                    however, are irresistible, and we are constrained to listen and revere as if we
                    were the auditors of some fugual music devised in honour of a primal and
                    long-buried deity. The melodies of this earliest Icelandic verse, elaborate in
                    their extreme and severe simplicity, are wholly rhythmical and alliterative, and
                    return upon themselves like a solemn incantation. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Havamdl,</hi> the Sayings of the High One, or Odin, follows next; this contains
                    proverbs and wise saws, and a series of stories, some of them comical, told by
                    Odin against himself. The <hi rend="italic">Vaflhru∂ ni&amp;mad,</hi> or sayings
                    of Vafthπiδnir, is written in the same mystical vein as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voluspa;</hi> in it the giant who gives his name to the poem is visited by Odin
                    in disguise, and is questioned by him about the cosmogony and chronology of the
                    Norse religion. <hi rend="italic">Grimnismdl,</hi> or the Sayings of Grimnir,
                    which is partly in prose, is a story of Odin’s imprisonment and torture by king
                    Geirröd. <hi rend="italic">For Skirrns,</hi> or the Journey of Skirnir, <hi
                    rend="italic">Harbarffslioff,</hi> or the Lay of Harbarδ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymis-kviffa,</hi> or the Song of Hymir, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Egisdrekka,</hi> or the Brewing of CEgir, are poems, frequently composed as
                    dialogue, containing legends of the gods, some of which are so ludicrous that it
                    has been suggested that they were intentionally burlesque. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thrymskvicja,</hi> or the Song of Thrym, possesses far more poetic interest; it
                    recounts in language of singular force and directness how Thor lost his hammer,
                    stolen by Thrym the giant, how the latter refused to give it up unless the
                    goddess Freyia was given him in marriage, and how Thor, dressed in women’s
                    raiment, personated Freyia, and, slaying Thrym, recovered his hammer. <hi
                    rend="italic">Λlmssmdl,</hi> or the Sayings of Alvis, is actually a philological
                    exercise under the semblance of a dialogue between Thor and Alvis the dwarf. Tn
                    <hi rend="italic">Vegtarnskνiff a,</hi> or the Song of Vegtam, Odin questions a
                    völva with regard to the meaning of the sinister dreams of Balder, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rigsmdl,</hi> or more properly <hi rend="italic">Rigsthula,</hi>
                    records how the god Heimdall, disguised as a man called Rig, wandered by the
                    sea-shore, where he met the original dwarf pair, Ai and Edda, t∙o <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n672/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0672-0651"/> whom he gave the power of child-bearing, and
                    thence sprung the whole race of thralls; then he went on and met with Afi and
                    Amma, and made them the parents -of the race of churls; then he proceeded until
                    he came to Fabir and Mo&lt;5ir, to whom he gave Jarl, the first of free men,
                    whom he himself brought up, teaching him to shoot and snare, and to use the
                    sword and runes. It is much to be lamented that of this most characteristic and
                    picturesque poem we possess only a fragment. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyndluljo∂',</hi> the Lay of Hyndla, the goddess Freyia rides to question the
                    völva Hyndla with regard to the ancestry of her young paramour Ottar; a very
                    fine quarrel ensues between the prophetess and her visitor. With this poem, the
                    first or wholly mythological portion of the collection closes. What follows is
                    heroic and pseudo-historic. The <hi rend="italic">Volundarhvicja,</hi> or Song
                    of Völundr, is engaged with the sufferings and adventures of Völundr, the
                    smith-king, during his stay with Nidud, king of Sweden. Völundr, identical with
                    the Anglo-Saxon Wêland and the German Welant, is sometimes confounded with Odin,
                    the master-smith. This poem contains the beautiful figure of Svanhvit, the
                    swan-maiden, who stays seven winters with Völundr, and then, yearning for her
                    fatherland, flies away home through the dark forest. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helgakvifta Hiorvarffs Sonar,</hi> the Song of Helgi, the Son of Hiörvarö,
                    which is largely in prose, celebrates the wooing by Helgi of Svava, who, like
                    Atalanta, ends by loving the man with whom she has fought in battle. Two Songs
                    of Helgi the Hunding’s Bane, <hi rend="italic">Helgahviffa Hundingsbaηa,</hi>
                    open the long and very important series of lays relating to the two heroic
                    families of the Völsungs and the Niblungs. Including the poems just mentioned,
                    there are about twenty distinct pieces in the poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi>
                    which deal more or less directly with this chain of stories. It is hardly
                    necessary to give the titles of these poems here in detail, especially as they
                    are, in their present form, manifestly only fragments of a great poetic saga,
                    possibly the earliest coherent form of the story so universal among the Teutonic
                    peoples. We happily possess a somewhat later prose version of this lost poem in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Volsungasaga,</hi> where the story is completely worked
                    out. In many places the prose of the <hi rend="italic">Volsungasaga</hi> follows
                    the verse of the Eddaic fragments with the greatest precision, often making use
                    of the very same expressions. At the same time there are poems in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edda</hi> which the author of the saga does not seem to have seen.
                    But if we compare the central portions of the myth, namely Sigurd’s conversation
                    with Fafnir, the death of Regin, the speech of the birds and the meeting with
                    the Valkyrje, we are struck -with the extreme fidelity of the prose romancer to
                    his poetic precursors in the <hi rend="italic">Sigurffarhviffa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fafnisbana;</hi> in passing on to the death of Sigurd, we perceive
                    that the version in the <hi rend="italic">Volsungasaga</hi> must be based upon a
                    poem now entirely lost. Of the further extension of the myth and its corruption
                    into the romantic epic of <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Nibelunge
                    Not,</hi> this is not the place for discussion. Suffice to say that in no
                    modernized or Germanized form does the legend attain such au exquisite colouring
                    of heroic poetry as in these earliest fragments of Icelandic song. A very
                    curious poem, in some MSS. attributed directly to Saemund, is the Lay of the
                    Sun, <hi rend="italic">Solarlio∂',</hi> which forms a kind of appendix to the
                    poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda.</hi> In this the spirit of a dead father
                    addresses his living son, and exhorts him, with maxims that resemble those of
                    <hi rend="italic">Havamal,</hi> to righteousness of life. The tone of the poem
                    is strangely confused between Christianity and Paganism, and it has been assumed
                    to be the composition of a writer in the act of transition between the old creed
                    and the new. It may, however, not impossibly, be altogether spurious as a poem
                    of great antiquity, and may merely be the production of some Icelandic monk,
                    anxious to imitate the Eddaic form and spirit. Finally <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fοrspjalls-</hi><hi rend="italic">ljo∂i</hi> or the Preamble, formerly known as
                    the Song of Odin’s Raven, is an extremely obscure fragment, of which little is
                    understood, although infinite scholarship has been expended on it. With this the
                    poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi> closes.</p>
                <p>The principal MS. of this <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi> is the Codex Regius in the
                    Royal Library at Copenhagen, written continuously, without regard to prose or
                    verse, o'n 45 leaves. This is that found by Bishop Brynjulf. Another valuable
                    fragment exists in the Ame-Magnaean collection in the University of Copenhagen,
                    consisting of six leaves. These are the only MSS. older than the 17th century
                    which contain a collection of the ancient ιnythico-heroic lays, but fragments
                    occur in various other works, and especially in the <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi>
                    of Snorri. The poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi> was translated into English
                    verse by Amos Cottle in 1797; the poet Gray produced a version of the <hi
