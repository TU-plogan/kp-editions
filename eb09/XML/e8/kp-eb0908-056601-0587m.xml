                    government of Erivan, famous as the seat of the Catholicus or pinnate of the
                    Armenian church. It is situated in the plain of the Aras or Araxes, about 2985
                    feet above the sea, 12 miles W. of Erivan and 30 N. of Mount Ararat. The
                    monastery comprises a pretty extensive complex of buildings, and is surrounded
                    by brick walls 30 feet high, which, with their loopholes and towers, present the
                    appearance of a fortress. Its architectural character has been considerably
                    impaired by additions and alterations in the modern Russian style. On the
                    western side of the quadrangle is the residence of the primate, on the south the
                    refectory, built by the Catholicus Abraham (1730- 1735), on the east the
                    lodgings for the monks, and on the north the cells. The cathedral is a small but
                    fine cruciform building with a Byzantine cupola at the intersection, a large
                    tower at the western end, and a smaller tower above each wing of the transepts.
                    Of special interest is the porch, built of red porphyry, and profusely adorned
                    with sculptured designs somewhat similar to those of Gothic architecture. The
                    interior of the church is decorated with Persian frescoes of flowers, birds, and
                    scroll work. It is here that the Catholicus confers episcopal consecration by
                    the sacred hand of St Gregory; and here every seven years he prepares with great
                    solemnity the holy oil which is to be used throughout the churches of the
                    Armenian communion. Of the numerous relics.the chief are the head of the spear
                    which pierced the Saviour’s side, a piece of Noah’s ark, presented by an angel
                    to St James of Nisibis, and a piece of the true cross. Outside of the main
                    entrance are the alabaster tombs of the primates Alexander I. (1714), Alexander
                    II. (1755), Daniel (1806), and Narses (1857), and in hospitable contiguity a
                    white marble monument erected by the East India Company to mark the
                    resting-place of Sir John Macdonald, who died at Tabriz in 1830, while on an
                    embassy to the Persian court. The library of the monastery is said at one time
                    to have contained 15,000 volumes, andin spite of depredation and neglect, it
                    still remains a rich storehouse of Armenian literature. Brosset’s <hi

                    rend="italic">T Etchmiadzin,</hi> St Petersburg, 1840, contained only 635
                    numbers, but the new list drawn up by the monks (a copy of which was presented
                    by Major Cunnyngham to the Oriental Library at Cambridge) mentions 2500 volumes,
                    many of great size. Among the more remarkable manuscripts are a copy of the
                    gospels in a massive binding of carved ivory dating from the 10th or 11th
                    century, and three bibles of the 13th century, one of which had belonged to
                    Aytoun II., king of Armenia. A type-foundry, a printingpress, and a bookbinding
                    establishment are maintained by the monks, who publish a weekly Armenian
                    newspaper called <hi rend="italic">The Ararat,</hi> and supply religious and
                    educationa. works for their co-religionists. The number of inmates in the
                    monastery varies considerably. In 1834, according to Dubois, there were 50 monks
                    and 13 bishops and archbishops; and in 1872, according to Telfer, there were 5
                    bishops and archbishops, 20 monks, and 25 novices. The revenue, estimated at
                    £10,000, is derived from the conventual domains, which, though much less
                    extensive than they once were, still comprise, not only a number of estates, but
                    five villages presented or rather restored by' the Russian en.peror. The
                    Catholicus has an annual income of 10,000 rubles. To the east of the monastery
                    is a college <pb break="no"

                    of about half a mile stand the churches of St Rhipsime and St Gaiana, two of the
                    early martyrs of Armenian Christianity; the latter is of special interest as the
                    burialplace of all those primates who are not deemed worthy by the synod of
                    interment besidethecathedral. From adistance the three churches forma fairly
                    striking group, and accordingly the Turkish name for Etchmiadzin is simply
                    Utch-Kilissi, or the Three Churches. A fourth of less importance is ignored. The
                    town of Etchmiadzin, oras itshouldbecalled Vagharshapat, contains about 8000
                    inhabitants, but has long ceased to be of any individual importance. According
                    to Armenian historians it dates from the 6th century n.c., and takes its name
                    from King Vagarsh, who in the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> chose it
                    as his residence and surrounded it with walls. The great apostle of Armenia, St
                    Gregory the Illuminator, having seen the Saviour descend in a flood of light in
                    the neighbourhood of the palace, was ordered by an angel to erect a church on
                    the spot. He obeyed the divine command in 309, and gave the building the
                    commemorative name of Edch-Miadzin, or Descended the Only Begotten. In 344
                    Vagharshapat ceased to be the Armenian capital, and in the 5th century the
                    patriarchal seat was removed to Tovin. The monastery was founded by Narses IL,
                    who ruled from 524-33; and a restoration was effected by Gomidas in 618. At
                    length in 1441 the primate George or Kevork brought back the see to the original
                    site, and from that day to the present time Etchmiadzin has been the centre of
                    the Armenian church. In the Russo-Persian war of 1827, though the monastery was
                    declared neutral territory by both belligerents, it was occupied by Russian
                    troops.</p>
