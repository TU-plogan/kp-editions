                    of the Peloponnesus, bounded on the N. by Achaia, E. by Arcadia, S. by Messenia,
                    and W. by the Ionian Sea. The local form of the name was Valis, or Valeia, and
                    its meaning, in all probability, the lowland. In its physical constitution Elis
                    is practically one with Achaia and Arcadia; its mountains are mere offshoots of
                    the Arcadian highlands, and its principal rivers are fed by Arcadian springs.
                    From Erymanthus in the north, Skollis (now known as Mavri and Santameri in
                    different parts of its length) stretches toward the west, and Pholoe along the
                    eastern frontier; in the south a prolongation of Mount Lycaeon bore in ancient
                    times the names of Minthe and Lapithus, which have given place respectively to
                    Alvena and to Kaiapha and Smerna. These mountains are well clothed with
                    vegetation, and present a soft and pleasing appearance in contrast to the
                    picturesque wildness of the parent ranges. They gradually sink towards the east
                    and die off into what was one of the richest alluvial tracts in the
                    Peloponnesus. Except where it is broken by the rocky promontories of Chleonatas
                    (now Chlemutzi) and Ichthys (now Katakolo), the coast lies low, with stretches
                    of sand in the north and lagoons and marshes towards the south. During the
                    summer months communication with the sea being established by means of canals,
                    these lagoons yield a rich harvest of fish to the inhabitants, who at the same
                    time, however, are almost driven from the coast by the swarms of gnats.</p>
                <p>Elis was divided into three districts—Hollow or Lowland Elis κοίλη Ηλιs),
                    Pisatis, or the territory of Pisa, and Triphylia, or the country of the three
                    tribes. Hollow Elis, the largest and most northern of the three, was watered by
                    the Peneus and its tributary the Ladon, whose united stream forms the modern
                    Gastuni. It included not only the champaign country originally designated by its
                    name, but also the mountainous region of Acrorea, occupied by the offshoots of
                    Erymanthus. Besides the capital city of Elis, it contained Cyllene, an Arcadian
                    settlement on the sea coast, whose inhabitants worshipped Hermes under the
                    phallic symbol, Pylus at the junction of the Peneus and the Ladon, which, like
                    so many other places of the same name, claimed to be the city of Nestor, and the
                    fortified frontier town of Lasion, the ruins of which are still visible at Kuti,
                    near the village of Kumani. The district was famous in antiquity for its cattle
                    and horses; and its byssus, supposed to have been introduced by the Phoenicians,
                    was inferior only to that of Palestine. Pisatis extended south from Hollow Elis
                    to the right bank of the Alpheus, and was divided into eight departments called
                    after as many towns. Of these Salmone, Heraclea, Cicysion, Dyspontium, and
                    Harpina are known,—the last being the reputed burial-place of Marmax, the
                    deliverer of Hippodamia. From the time of the early investigators it has been
                    disputed whether Pisa, which gave its name to the district, has ever been a
                    city, or was only a fountain or a hill. By far the most important spot in
                    Pisatis was the scene of the great Olympic games, on the northern bank of the
                    Alpheus; but for details in regard to the locality, and the results of the
                    explorations commenced <pb break="no"

                    from the Alpheus to the Neda, which forms the boundary towards Messenia. Of the
                    nine towns mentioned by Polybius, only two attained to any considerable
                    influence— Lepreus and Macistus, which gave the names of Lepreatis and Macistia
                    to the southern and northern halves of Triphylia. The former was the seat of a
                    strongly independent population, and continued to take every opportunity of
                    resisting the supremacy of the Eleans. In the time of Pausanius it was in a very
                    decadent condition, and possessed only a poor brick-built temple of Demeter; but
                    considerable remains of its outer walls are still in existence near the village
                    of Strovitzi, on a part of the Minthe range.</p>
                <p>The original inhabitants of Elis were called Caucones and Paroreatae. From traces
                    of the worship of Venus in the city of Elis, and from the presence of such names
                    as Same and lardanus, it is believed that the Phoenicians had settlements in the
                    country at a very remote period. The inhabitants of Elis first appear in Grecian
                    history under the title of Epeans, as setting out for the Trojan war, and they
                    are described by Homer as living in a state of constant hostility with their
                    neighbours the Pylians. At the close of the eleventh century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the Dorians invaded the Peloponnesus, and Elis fell
                    to the share of Oxylus and the Aetolians. These people, amalgamating with the
                    Epeans, formed a powerful kingdom in the north of Elis. After this many changes
                    took place in the political distribution of the country, till at length it came
                    to acknowledge only three tribes, each independent of the others. These tribes
                    were the Epeans, Minyae, and Eleans. Before the end of the eighth century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> however, the Eleans had vanquished both their
                    rivals, and established their supremacy over the whole country. Among the other
                    advantages which they thus gained was the right of celebrating the Olympic
                    games, which had formerly been the prerogative of the Pisans. The attempts which
                    this people made to recover their lost privilege, during a period of nearly two
                    hundred years, ended at length in the total destruction of their city by the
                    Eleans. From the time of this event (572 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) till
                    the Peloponnesian war, the peace of Elis remained undisturbed. In that great
                    contest Elis sided at first with Sparta; but that power, jealous of the
                    increasing prosperity of its ally, availed itself of the first pretext to pick a
                    quarrel. At the battle of Mantinea the Eleans fought against the Spartans, who,
                    as soon as the war came to a close, took vengeance upon them by depriving them
                    of Triphylia and the towns of the Acrorea. The Eleans made no attempt to
                    re-establish their authority over these places, till the star of Thebes rose in
                    the ascendant after the battle of Leuctra. It is not unlikely that they would
                    have effected their purpose had not the Arcadian confederacy come to the
                    assistance of the Triρhylians. In 366 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> hostilities
                    broke out between them, and though the Eleans were at first successful, they
                    were soon overpowered, and their capital very nearly fell into the hands of the
                    enemy. Unable to make head against their opponents, they applied for assistance
                    to the Spartans, who invaded Arcadia, and forced the Arcadians to recall their
                    troops from Elis. The general result of this war was the restoration of their
                    territory to the Eleans, who were also again invested with the right of holding
                    the Olympic games. During the Macedonian supremacy in Greece they sided with the
                    victors, but refused to tight against their countrymen. After the death of
                    Alexander they renounced the Macedonian alliance. At a subsequent period they
                    joined the Aetolian League, but persistently refused to identify themselves with
                    the Acliaeans. When the whole of Greece fell under the Roman yoke, the sanctity
                    of Olympia secured for the Eleans a certain amount of indulgence. The games
                    still continued to attract to the country large numbers of strangers, until they
                    were finally put down by Theodosius in 391, two years previous to the utter
                    destruction of the country by the Gothic invasion under Alaric. In later times
                    Elis fell successively into the hands of the Franks and the Venetians, under
                    whose rule it recovered to some extent its ancient prosperity. By the latter
                    people the province of Belvedere on the Peneus was called, in consequence of its
                    fertility, “the milch cow of the Morea.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Elis,</hi> the chief city in the above country, was situated
                    on the river Peneus, just where it passes from the mountainous district of
                    Acrorea into the champaign below. According to native tradition, it was
                    originally founded by Oxylus, the leader of the Aetolians, whose statue stood in
                    the market-place. In 471 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It received a great
                    extension by the incorporation, or “synoikismos,” of various small hamlets,
                    whose inhabitants took up their abode in the city.</p>
                <p>Up to this date it only occupied the ridge of the hill now called Kalascopi, to
                    the south of the Peneus, but afterwards it spread out in several suburbs, and
                    even to the other side of the stream. As all the athletes who intended to take
                    part in the Olympic games were obliged to undergo a month’s training in the
                    city, its gymnasiums were among its principal institutions. They were three in
                    number—the “Xystos,” with its pillared galleries, its avenues of plane-trees,
                    its plethrion or wrestling-place, its altars to Hercules, to Eros and Anteros,
                    to Demeter and Cora, and its cenotaph of Achilles; the “Tetragonon,”
                    appropriated to the lighter exercises, and adorned with a statue of Zeus; and
                    the “Maltho,” in the interior of which was a hall or council chamber called
                    Lalichmion after its founder. Among the other objects of interest were the
                    temple of Artemis Philomirax; the Hellanodicaeum, or office of the
                    Hellano-dicasts; the Corcyrean Hall, a building in the Dorian style with two
                    façades, built of spoils from Corcyra; a temple of Apollo Acesius; a temple of
                    Silenus; an ancient structure supported on oaken pillars and reputed to be the
                    burial place of Oxylus; the building where the sixteen women of Elis were wont
                    to weave a robe for the statue of Hera at Olympia; and the shrine of Dionysus,
                    whose festival, the Thyia, was yearly celebrated in the neighbourhood. The
                    history of the town is closely identified with that of the country. In 399 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was occupied by Agis, king of Sparta. The
                    acropolis was fortified in 312 by Telesphorus, the admiral of Antigonus, but it
                    was shortly afterwards dismantled by Philemon, another of his generals. A view
                    of the site is given by Stanhope.</p>
