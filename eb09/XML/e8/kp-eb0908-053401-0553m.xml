                    theological term for the facts revealed in Scripture about a future state, and
                    the result of Christian speculation on these facts.</p>

                    the appearance of Christ in visible triumph. The feeling was natural, and not
                    new. The Jews always believed that the Messianic kingdom would be preceded by an
                    unusual manifestation of the hostile powers of heathenism.<note anchored="true"

                    regarded as a sign of approaching deliverance; and the hopes of the nation were
                    revived and its courage sustained by apocalyptic visions, in which the future
                    was depicted as a time of undisputed triumph and unending prosperity. A distinct
                    class of literature—of which the prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah afford
                    partial examples—grew out of this feeling, and from it has been mainly derived
                    the form, not only of Jewish, but also of Christian eschatology.</p>

                    these two periods remained associated all that ancient prophecy connected with
                    the restoration of the Hebrew monarchy. The apocalyptic literature which began
                    with the book of Daniel, and which belongs to the post-exile period, had, it is
                    true, already changed the form of the primitive national hopes. The restoration
                    had become the resurrection; the idea of judgment had been enlarged to include
                    the dead; and the final consummation was depicted, not as a mere distinction of
                    the heathen or their subjugation to Judaism, butas a universal catastrophe in
                    which all who had ever lived would have their part. But the mode of presentation
                    had not changed, and the old prophetic language was literally adopted, although
                    the sphere of its application had so infinitely extended.</p>
                <p>Christian eschatology, then, is especially occupied with the destinies of the
                    church in the concluding act of the world’s drama. In formal treatises which
                    trace the historical development of the opinion on the last things, they are
                    usually arranged under the heads—Second Advent, Millennium, Resurrection,
                    Judgment, Conflagration of the World, and the State of the Blessed and the
                    Damned.</p>
                <p>But experience taught the first generation of Christians to postpone the moment
                    of the realization of their hopes. The second advent—which,however, as the
                    fourth gospel teaches, had already been spiritually realized—was delayed.
                    Already when St Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, some had died before the
                    fulfilment of their desire, and the church was troubled with fears lest they
                    should awake from the deathsleep too late for the divine appearing. A new epoch
                    was therefore introduced. The destinies of the individual from the moment of
                    departure from this life enter into the inquiry, and the already boundless field
                    of speculation is increased by the addition of controversies about an
                    intermediate state, purgatory, and the limboes<note anchored="true"

                    partitioned hell. Nor is the area of theory substantially narrowed for
                    Protestant theology, although it limits the last things to four—death,
                    resurrection, judgment, end of the world, or more commonly, in practical dis
                    courses, to death, judgment, heaven, and hell.</p>
                <p>The history of eschatology is in great measure the history of “lawless and
                    uncertain thoughts” on these matters. The best notion of the extravagances
                    allowed to speculation is obtained by a glance at the concluding part of the <hi

                    discusses these subjects. Thirty questions (besides an appendix devoted to
                    purgatory) are proposed, each question being divided into several articles, and
                    each article supported and opposed by many arguments. Then follows a conclusion,
                    with the doctor’s remarks on his conclusion. We take a few of the propositions
                    at random :—“Whether souls are conducted to heaven or to hell immediately after
                    death;” “Whether the limbus of hell is the same as Abraham’s bosom;” “Whether
                    the limbus puerorum is the same as the limbus patrum;” or, passing over a few
                    pages, “Whether the sun and moon will be really obscured at the day of
                    judgment;” “Whether the fire which is to purge the world will be like in kind to
                    elemental fire;” or again, “Whether all the members of the human body will rise
                    with it;” “Whether the hair and nails will reappear;” and so on to questions of
                    age, size, and sex.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    heaven and hell, while poetry and art were permitted to seize on the unseen
                    future as their own domain, and, alas, to stamp their figured expressions

                <p>There are two distinct modes of treatment for these difficult subjects. In the

                    Calvinists chiefly rely in support of a theory of unending penalty for sin—that
                    the violated majesty of an Infinite Being demands infinite pain—is founded on a

                    25.</p></note> while a gentler creed appears with every revival of the Platonic
                    philosophy, which, as Neander observes, extended its spiritualizing influence to
                    eschatology as to other doctrines of the faith.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first clear note of immortality in Hebrew
                    literature is struck in the Book of Wisdom, the work of an Alexandrian Jew. The
                    Origenists, perhaps Scofus Erigena, and, in later times, some at least of the
                    Cambridge Platonists, are examples of the statement above.</p></note></p>
                <p>But without entering on the region of pure speculation, the New Testament itself
                    discloses two entirely different eschatological methods. The one is moral,
                    spiritual, idealist, employing outward forms only as symbols, viewing the future
                    rather in regard to development of character than as a mode of existence. This
                    is the Christian as contrasted with the J ewish method. The other follows the
                    natural tendency of Hebrew thought. It is literal, material, sensuous. It
                    delights in chronological arrangements of the unknown future, and topographical
                    arrangements of the unseen world. Missing the repeated warnings of Christ,
                    delivered both in parables and in express admonitions— warnings to prepare for a
                    slow and gradual development of His kingdom, and to leave “the times” in His
                    Father’s keeping—this method aims in all its representations at abrupt
                    catastrophe and at a consummation depending on startling and supernatural
                    surprises.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Abrupt

                <p>These distinctive tendencies appear within the New Testament most prominently—the
                    one in the fourth gospel the other in the Apocalypse. The Pauline theology
                    exhibits them side by side, showing their discordance in the absence of all
                    attempt on the part of the apostle to reconcile them. Thus in his treatment of
                    the resurrection, in the one view it is the sudden appearing of Christ which
                    will begin the heavenly life for all, in the other this life in Christ—begun
                    already on earth—will attain its perfection at the death of the individual. As
                    the moment of the second advent receded, the church’s expectation necessarily
                    transferred the object of Christian hope—the communion with Christ in the
                    kingdom of glory—to the earlier event, death; but St Paul retains the old
                    terminology without endeavouring to adapt it to this change <hi rend="italic"
                    >{cf.</hi> Phil. i. 22, 23, iii. 10, 11, with 1 Cor. xv. 52 <hi rend="italic"
                    >f.;</hi> 1 Thess. iv. 15, drc.). The same discordance is observable in his
                    treatment of the judgment and of the end of the world. In his use of terms and
                    reference to times the apostle follows his Jewish training. “The day of the
                    Lord,” with all its prophetic associations as “day of judgment,” is preserved;
                    the sudden and final award of wrath or favour appears in its forensic form; and
                    all is ended by a separation between the heirs of eternal life and the lost.</p>
                <p>But the spirit of the apostolic teaching is independent of this form. The idea
                    that regards the development of the higher life as a constant process varying in
                    each individual, but having its roots in the common life of the church,—that
                    looks on to the ultimate perfection as a unity of all with the Redeemer in God,
                    the whole universe having been gradually subdued by Christ to himself,—this,
                    which we may call the essentially Christian idea, is what we receive as the
                    innermost feeling of the man who, from a Pharisee and a zealous upholder of the
                    law, was called to be a chosen instrument of the gospel of the favour of God in
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>In the patristic period the conflict between the two rival systems is apparent in
                    every detail. Here, as everywhere else, the opposition is marked in regard to
                    the duration of punishment. But it rages most fiercely, perhaps, round the
                    doctrine of the millennium. The earthly reign of Messiah was transferred from
                    Jewish to Christian expectation. But the Christian hope could not without
                    inconsistency take a Jewish form. Christ’s kingdom of heaven refused to realize
                    itself as a period of sensual enjoyment, and the poetic chronology of the
                    apocalypse was soon found to have raised difficulties of an insurmountable kind
                    which were not diminished when a locality was sought for the promised earthly
                    reign. If it was found at Jerusalem before the final judgment, how could the
                    expectations connected with the second advent be fulfilled? In the Apocalypse
                    the completion of the kingdom of God takes place in the New Jerusalem—the
                    millennium appearing only as an interval of rest after the crisis of the
                    conflict with Antichrist. Thus a new decisive epoch is introduced, the
                    consummation of things having thus gradually receded from the incarnation, which
                    was the focus of Jewish eschatology, to the second advent, and still further to
                    the close of the millennial reign. The later interpretation, fixing the
                    beginning of the thousand years kingdom at the incarnation, though decidedly
                    opposed to the Apocalypse, is a recurrence to the primitive Jewish view. In
                    accordance with this opinion, the end of the world was very generally expected
                    about the year 1000. Another view dated the millennium from the formal adoption
                    of Christianity by the empire under Constantine, and caused the expectation of
                    the end of things which was so prevalent in the 14th century.<note

                <p>The most important of all the questions that arise in connection with eschatology
                    relates, of course, to the teaching of our Lord. A true view of the future must
                    be a Theodicea. It must correspond to the highest human conception of the nature
                    and character of God. The revelation in and through Christ affords this highest
                    conception. And yet it is in the discourses of Christ himself that men find the
                    passages which seem toprove the doctrine most irreconcilable with the insight He
                    has elsewhere given into the Divine heart.</p>

                <p>Eternity of punishment is often assumed to be a truth of natural religion,—an
                    intuitive human belief. It would be truer to say that in all races the first
                    vague guesses at immortality include no thought of retribution at all. The
                    continued existence was “something between being and not being.”<note

                    himself. Intellectually and morally he ended at death. Homer speaks of life and
                    form in Hades, but says there is no mind there at all. The movement, freedom,
                    joy of existence, ended for the Greek at death. The best that could then happen
                    to him was to kuow that his body had been buried. All else was featureless,
                    lifeless, inane,—an existence without even the excitement of the possibility of
                    dying again. The bourne once reached, not only was there no return, but no
                    further bourne remained to be aimed at. Thus the intense consciousness of the
                    apparent finality of death determined the form of the earliest hopes of
                    immortality when they began to dawn. Progress did not enter into them; there
                    would be no discipline because nothing to exercise it on, no change of
                    condition, for this implies power of adaptation if not of choice.</p>

                    subterranean tomb, with the barred and bolted gates common to Hebrew tombs, in
                    which the ghosts (Rephaim) did not even flit about, but lay like corpses in a
                    sepulchre. No thought of retribution was connected with this deep and gloomy
                    under-world. It was the common receptacle of all. The distinctions there were
                    social or national, not moral. The only approach to a retributive idea is found
                    in the exile time, in an expression of Ezekiel’s, who locates the uncircumcised
                    heathen in the “sides of the pit,” possibly the deepest and darkest part of
                    Sheol. (See Ps. lxiii. 9, lxxxix. 19, cxliii. 3, cvii. 18; Job X. 20-22, xi. 8,
                    iii. 14, xxx. 23; Is. vii. 11, xviιi. 18; 1 Kings ∑i. 2; Ezek. xxxii. 23.)</p>
                <p>This primitive idea had, by the time of Christ, developed under influences of a
                    very different kind. In the first place, the horror with which an ancient Hebrew
                    had contemplated death, because in Sheol he would be cut off from all communion
                    with the covenant God, was dissipated under the truer religious feeling
                    struggling into life in the later Psalms and the book of Job.<note

                    did not reach to the under-world. The King of Terrors was its only king. They
                    who had been God’s sheep when alive, in Sheol had a new shepherd, Death (Ps.
                    xlix. 14, Perowne’s translation). But truer views of God’s nature dissipated
                    this horror, and pious souls who despaired of redress in this life, began to
                    look even in Sheol for a manifestation of divine justice and a proof of divine
                    love. At length was grasped the hope of a deliverance from the prison house of
                    the dead, and the doctrine of the resurrection crowned this hope, and gave a
                    definite shape to the eschatology of the Jews.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The release from the under-world which the Jew contemplated in a bodily

                    Hebrews believed that the heathen and unjust would remain in the death-sleep of
                    Sheol, while faithful Israel received back the soul in the resurrection (2 Macc.
                    vii. 14, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xviii. 1,
                    3). In different forms this thought reappears in Christian eschatology. Some
                    find it in St Γaul. It was the origin of the belief in a two-fold resurrection:
                    the unjust, not being worthy to participate when the saints awake at their
                    Lord’s second coming, remain below till the final judgment.</p>
                <p>But iu the post-exile days—that veritable middle age of Israel—other influences
                    appeared. Intolerable wrongs drove men to seek solace for themselves in visions
                    of paradise, vengeance on their foes in visions of hell. Now appear the
                    divisions of Sheol into receptacles for the good and bad. Their origin is seen
                    in the apocalyptic book of Enoch. In chap, xxii. of that remarkable book, which,

                    Gehenna (f.e., the valley of Hinnom or the sons of Hinnom) and its ghastly
                    associations were ready to supply images terrible beyond any that the mind of
                    heathen poet or philosopher had conceived. Already known as the perpetual abode
                    of corruption and fire, “the place where lie the corpses of those who have
                    transgressed against Jehovah—and their worm shall not die, neither shall their
                    fire be quenched,” it had become the apt symbol of utter moral depravity and
                    ruin. But it was the unknown author of the book of Enoch who first saw it as
                    “the accursed of the accursed for ever,” who first placed in the dark ravine one
                    of the mouths of hell, and thus from an emblem of the moral ruin attending sin,
                    made it the actual place of punishment for sinners.<note anchored="true"

                <p>On the other side of Hades was placed Paradise—a term whose origin is

                    with divers fruits, mighty mountains whereon grow lilies and roses (2 Esdras ii.
                    19). Prophetical language supplied other symbols of joy—especially the happy

                    questions, and the answers are wildly conjectural;” and no one can yet decide

                    15, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> James iii. 6).</p>
                <p>The popular views of a future state regard the use Jesus made of current terms as
                    a sanction of their literal meaning. But from the very earliest Christian times
                    another interpretation has been given. It has been understood that Christ
                    treated popular religious terms as only the symbols of a false creed can be
                    effectually treated. He rescued them for the service of the new and true. “He
                    took from their future and remote, in order to give them a present and
                    immediate, force and aspect.” He employed the familiar images of heaven and hell
                    to impress on men’s consciences the supreme bliss of righteousness and the awful
                    misery of sin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This view
                    is very generally adopted with regard to the “worm” of Gehenna, which is
                    interpreted to mean the gnawing of an evil conscience. Unfortunately the fashion
                    set by Augustine of choosing what terms shall be literal and what metaphorical
                    has prevailed. See Aug., <hi rend="italic">Civ. Dei,</hi> xχi. 9,-“Let each one
                    make his own choice, either assigning the fire to the body and the worm to trie
                    soul,—the one figuratively, the other really, or assigning both really to the
                    body.</p></note> If His words have been misapprehended and misrepresented in
                    this particular, so were they, even by the first disciples, in others (John xi.
                    13; Mark viii. 16, &amp;?.). He taught on the principle of His well-known
                    saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Still a careful regard to His audience is
                    traceable iu His use of apocalyptic language about His second coming; it is to
                    Jews only,— the twelve, or the High Priest, or the Sanhedrim, or Nathanael—the
                    “Israelite indeed,”—that he speaks ofcleft heavens, cloud chariots, and
                    attendant troops of angels. With the Roman governor he avoids Jewish
                    metaphors.</p></note></p>
                <p>Special instances would take us to too great a length. Christ’s treatment of the
                    resurrection, both with sceptics and believers (Matt, xxiι. 30-32; John xi. 25),
                    was such as to dislodge His hearers’ thoughts from the accidents (so to speak)
                    of the great change, and fix them on its moral and spiritual aspects. The same
                    intention appears also in His allusion to the judgment (John v. 25); while in
                    the one unmistakable reference to the future heaven, He fastens the hope of His
                    followers entirely on the thought of abiding communion with Himself (John xiv.
                    1-3).</p>
                <p>There are still certain features of eschatological doctrine which require notice.
                    The notion of an Intermediate State was generally prevalent during the first
                    three centuries. It was exactly analogous to the Jewish notion of a divided
                    under world. The souls of the pious, says Justin <hi rend="italic">{D. e.
                    Tryph.,</hi> 5), take up their abode in a better, those of the wicked in a worse
                    place. Tertulliau, however, believed that the martyrs went direct to the bliss
                    of heaven—a view probably founded on Rev. vii. 14, 15. The doctrine changed its
                    shape many times. It produced an Arabian heresy combated by Origen, that both
                    soul and body fall into a death sleep, fιom which they will not awake to the
                    last day. Revived at a later time, under the name Psychopannychy, it was made
                    the subject of a treatise by Calvin. But the existence of an intermediate state
                    remains a dogma of the Eastern Church to this day. In the Western the doctrine
                    of Purgatory gradually absorbed it.</p>
                <p>The idea of a purifying fire seems to have grown originally out of the belief in
                    the general conflagration of the world. This belief, which so much occupies the
                    Sibylline books, came perhaps from the Stoic philosophy.<note anchored="true"

                    Stoic authorities are given.</p></note> It was supported by Deut, xxxii. 22, and
                    though it finds no place in the Apocalypse, had penetrated religious thought
                    before the composition of the second epistle of Peter (2 Pet. iii. 7-12). The
                    early fathers agree in ascribing to this fire a purgative virtue, but with every
                    variety of opinion as to the mode o.' its operation. Augustine first transferred
                    it to Hades and the intermediate state, thus laying the foundation for the view
                    of purgatory which Gregory the Great formulated into a dogma. Distinction must
                    always be made between the early purifying flames, through which good and bad
                    alike were destined to pass, and the Roman purgatory, in which only those
                    destined at last for heaven worked out the residue of the temporal penalty for
                    sin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Authorities for the
                    history of Purgatory will be found in Hagenbach and Neander.</p></note></p>
                <p>Reformed eschatology differs from that of the primitive church in the absence of
                    the intermediate state, from that of Rome in the rejection of purgatory. Both
                    these forms of belief are felt to have mitigated in some degree the doctrine of
                    an endless hell, which in Protestantism is brought more prominently into the
                    foreground, the final doom being fixed not now at the general judgment, but at
                    death, at which, without any authority from Scripture, the popular creed
                    supposes the sinner’s fate to be unalterably determined.</p>
                <p>Many attempts in different quarters have been made to revive the milder creeds of
                    the early church.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Modern

                    famous essay. His own struggle to regain for the adjective αιώνιος its ethical
                    sense is well known. Perhaps he took too little account of the element of
                    duration undoubtedly existing in it. The two senses pass imperceptibly into one
                    another, but the scriptural use, when not distinctly ethical, gives it the sense
                    of indefinite not of endless duration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr White says that of the 90 subjects to which it or its

                    dispute, what scores of writers (see <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Burnett, <hi

                    But Mr Maurice vindicated, at least for English clergymen, a perfect freedom on
                    this subject; and though in his own case the claim w as not allowed, his opinion
                    was confirmed by the formal decision in the “Essays and Reviews” case.</p>
                <p>The result of this is apparent now throughout the thinking part of Christendom;
                    the subject of eschatology, in connexion with the wider subject of immortality,
                    is exercising profound attention. Philosophy and science are equally concerned
                    in it with religion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    trying to reconcile the voice of Scripture with the voices of science and
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>Two prominent attempts perhaps claim notice. The ad vocates of Conditional
                    Immortality or Annihilation maintain, from the letter of Scripture, destruction
                    and not endless suffering to be the destiny of the lost. They take advan tage of
                    the doubt existing as to St Paul’s doctrine of the termination of the world in
                    unity—whether by unbelievers being completely annihilated, or by their being all
                    finally converted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Pfleiderer, <hi rend="italic">Pauline Τheol.,</hi> c. vii., andc∕. Baur, <hi

                    sting there can be no eternal punishment.”</p></note> The view that immortality
                    is not inherent in fallen human nature, but is the gift of God in Christ, has
                    had many supporters, and in this part of their system, the advocates of
                    annihilation justly claim the authority of many great names. But the details of
                    their eschatology are somewhat confused and conflicting.<note anchored="true"

                    Martyr and Irenaeus, are some well-known passages which seem clearly to imply
                    either the ultimate redemption or the total destruction of sinners.”—Farrar, <hi

                <p>The Universaliste or Origenists maintain, in the language of Acts iii. 21, a hope
                    of the “restitution of all things.” The hope is grounded not on the literal
                    assertion of any one text,—though as many are quotedin its favour as in that of
                    any other theory of the future,—but on the divine character and purpose as
                    revealed in Christ, and the implied failure of the redemptive work of the
                    Saviour unless all for whom He died ultimately partake of salvation. Between
                    this and the Augustinian system, which the great doctor candidly confesses dooms
                    the vast majority of men to endless perdition, there are of course many
                    gradations of opinion. Possibly Universaliste are apt to quote in their favour
                    all who in any degree show themselves, to use Augustine’s word, more merciful.
                    Certainly a long list of illustrious names claim rank among them. Origen, of
                    course, heads it, though earlier fathers—Athenagoras, for instance—are sometimes
                    called in as witnesses of the milder creed. The fate of those who had died
                    before Christ, and of the heathen, began at an early time to exercise the
                    conscience of Christians. The descent of Christ into hell was by many believed
                    to have had for its object the deliverance of souls from thence.<note
