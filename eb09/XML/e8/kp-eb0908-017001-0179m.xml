                    chromium sesquioxide: it also never presents the internal striae often seen in
                    the beryl. The chemical composition of the emerald may be represented by the
                    formula 6SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,3GlO. It occurs iu six-sided prismatic crystals of the
                    hexagonal system, the edges of which not unfrequently show various
                    modifications. The emerald is transparent or translucent, and has a vitreous,
                    rarely resinous lustre, an uneven and conchoidal fracture, a hardness of 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5-8, and a specific gravity of 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 670to 2 ’ 732. It is brittle and comparatively soft
                    when fresh from the mine, but hardens on exposure to the air. The specific
                    gravity of crystallized emeralds after fusion was found by Greville Williams to
                    be 2 ’ 4, 9 per cent, of the original weight having been lost. The emerald is
                    unaffected by acids, but with borax gives before the blowpipe a transparent
                    greenish glass. On friction it becomes electric. Wohler, Rose, Hofmeister, and
                    Greville Williams have shown that the emerald may be heated to a very high
                    temperature without destruction of its colour, which cannot therefore, as
                    supposed by Lewy, be due to the organic impurities discovered in the stone.
                    Cleavage of the emerald at right angles to the axis of the crystals may be
                    effected without much difficulty, and in the East, previous to about the middle
                    of the 15th century, the stone was generally worn in slices so obtained. The
                    finest emeralds are procured from Muzo, in Colombia (see vol. vi. p. 154). The
                    fossiliferous character of the limestone in which they occur at Muzo. and the
                    presence in them of from 1*65 to 2*15 per cent, of water, led Mr Lewy to the
                    conclusion that they must have been crystallized out of aqueous solution. Other
                    localities are Henbachthal in Salzburg, Odontchelong in Siberia, and Canjargum
                    in India. The emeralds of Colombia, according to Boussingault, are divided into
                    several classes, the principal of which are the canutillos or the crystallized
                    and more valuable stones, and the morallons or amorphous stones, poor in colour,
                    and of little value. The Hebrew word nophech, rendered “emerald” in the English
                    version of the Scriptures, appears to have been the carbuncle. The emerald was
                    highly valued by the ancients (see Pliny, Nat. Hist., xxxvii. 5). Various
                    virtues were formerly ascribed to the gem: it was said to be good for the eyes,
                    to colour water green, to assist women in childbirth, and to drive away evil
                    spirits; and in the East it is still accredited with talismanic and medicinal
                    properties. One of the most celebrated examples of the emerald is that in the
                    possession of the duke of Devonshire, measuring upwards of 2 inches in length,
                    and across its three diameters 2∣, 2∣, and 1⅞ inches. Other fine stones are the
                    Hope emerald, weighing 6 oz, and those of the Russian, Saxon, and Papal crowns.
                    Emeralds are cut on a copper wheel with emery, and polished on a tin wheel with
                    rotten-stone. “In a good gem,” says Mr Emanuel, “the surface must be perfectly
                    straight and smooth, so as to cast no darkening shadow on any of its particles.”
                    The form usually given to emeralds is that of a square table with the edges
                    replaced, the lower surface being cut into facets parallel to their sides. When
                    fine they are always set without a foil; and, as their brilliancy is someλvhat
                    impaired by candlelight, they are generally surrounded with small diamonds or
                    pearls, which enhance their effect. The gem has been very successfully imitated
                    by manufacturers of paste stones, the colouring matter used being oxide of
                    chromium. As a gem the emerald is reckoned inferior only to the diamond and
                    ruby, but, unlike them, it does not increase in value in proportion to the cube
                    of its weight. What is termed the Oriental emerald is a green variety of
                    corundum, an exceedingly scarce gem.</p>
