                <p><label type="entry">EURE</label>, a department in the north-east of France, ono
                    of the five formed out of the old province of Normandy, is bounded on the N. by
                    the department of Seine Inférieure, W. by Calvados, S. by Orne and Eure-et-Loir,
                    and E. by Seine-et-Oise and Oise. It has an area of 2420 square miles, and lies
                    between 48° 39' and 49° 29' N. lat., and 0° 15' and 1° 45' E. long. The surface
                    is flat, with some ranges of low hills, none of them exceeding 300 feet in
                    height. The Seine flows from S.E. to N.W. through the department, dividing it
                    into two unequal parts, and after touching the frontier at two or three points
                    forms near its mouth part of the northern boundary. All the rivers of the
                    department flow into the Seine,—on the right bank the Audelle and the Epte, and
                    on the left the Eure with its tributaries the Avre and thelton, andtheRille with
                    its tributary the Charentonne. The Eure, from which the department takes its
                    name, rises in Orne, and flowing first east and then west through Eure-et-Loir,
                    falls into the Seine G miles below Louviers, after a course of 93 miles. The
                    Rille likewise rises in Orne, and flows generally northward to its mouth in the
                    estuary of the Seine. The climate is mild, but moist and variable. The soil is
                    generally clayey, resting on a bed of chalk; but along the Seine there are some
                    barren sandy tracts quite incapable of cultivation. A great part of the
                    department, however, is very fertile and well tilled. The chief cereal
                    cultivated is wheat, but flax also is largely grown. There is a wide extent of
                    pasturage on which are reared a considerable number of cattle and sheep, and
                    especially those horses of pure Norman breed for which the department has long
                    been celebrated. Fruit is very abundant, especially apple3 and pears, from which
                    much cider and perry are made, and vineyards on the Seine, Eure, and Avre yield
                    a considerable quantity of wine. Wild game, especially of the winged sorts, is
                    very plentiful, and the rivers abound in fish. Iron ore is very abundant, and
                    the department is noted for its mining and manufacturing industry. Cotton,
                    linen, and woollen cloths of every kind are fabricated. There are large
                    establishments for making copper ware of all kinds, <pb break="no"

                    and needles, glass for windows and glass bottles, and jewellery and trinkets.
                    Such goods form the trade; and, in addition to these, firewood, timber, cattle,
                    honey, wax, and corn are furnished to the district surrounding the department.
                    Eure is divided into the following arrondissements :— Evreux, Louviers, Les
                    Andelys, Bernay, and Pont-Audemer; and its capital is Evreux. Notwithstanding
                    the number of industries carried on in the department the population has for
                    some time been decreasing; while in 1851 it was 415,777, it was only 377,874 in
                    1872, and 373,G29 in 1876.</p>
