                    or jejunia qιιatuor temporum,. The Ember weeks are the complete weeks next
                    following Holy Cross Day (September 14), St Lucy’s Day (December 13), the first
                    Sunday in Lent, and Whitsun Day. The Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays of these
                    weeks are the Ember days distinctively, the following Sundays being the days of
                    ordination. These dates are given in the following memorial distich with a frank
                    indifference to quantity and metre—</p>

                </lg>
                <p>The word Ember is of uncertain derivation. We may at once dismiss, as founded
                    only on an accidental similarity of sound, that from the “embers” or ashes
                    erroneously assumed to have been used at these seasons in token of humiliation.
                    Other more probable derivations are from the Anglo-Saxon ymb-ren, a circuit or
                    revolution (from ymb, around, and rennen, to run); or by process of
                    agglutination and phonetic decay, from the Latin quatuor tempora. Those who
                    advocate this latter derivation appeal to the analogous forms by which these
                    seasons are designated in some of the Teutonic languages, e.g.—German,
                    quatember; Dutch, quatertemper; Danish, hvatember; Swedish, tampeτ-dagar. But
                    the occurrence of the Anglo-Saxon compounds ymbren-tid, ymbreη-ινucaη,
                    ymbren-faes-tan, ymbren-dagas, for Ember tide, weeks, fasts, days, favours the
                    former derivation, which is also confirmed by the use of the word imbren in the
                    Acts of the council of Aenham, 1009 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (“jejunia
                    quatuor tempora quae imbren vocant ”). It corresponds also with Pope Leo the
                    Great’s definition, “jejunia ecclesiastica per totius anni circulum
                    distributa.”</p>
                <p>The observance of the Ember days is confined to the Western Church, and had its
                    origin as an ecclesiastical ordinance in Rome. They were probably at first
                    merely the fasts preparatory to the three great festivals of Christmas, Easter,
                    and Pentecost. A fourth was subsequently added, for the sake of symmetry, to
                    make them correspond with the four seasons, and they became known as the
                    jejunium vernum, aestivum, autumnale, and hiemale, so that, to quote Pope Leo’s
                    words, “the law of abstinence might apply to every season of the year,” An
                    earlier mention of these fasts, as four in number—the first known—is in the
                    writings of Philastrius, bishop of Brescia, in the middle of the 4th century, He
                    also connects them with the great Christian festivals (De Hceres., 119). In
                    Leo’s time, 440-461 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> Wednesday, Friday, and
                    Saturday were already the days of special observance. From Rome the Ember days
                    gradually spread through the whole of Western Christendom. Uniformity of
                    practice, however, in this particular was of somewhat slow growth. Neither in
                    Gaul nor Spain do they seem to have been generally recognized much before the
                    8th century. Their introduction into Britain appears to have been earlier,
                    dating from Augustine, 597 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> acting under the
                    authority of Gregory the Great, lhe general period of the four fasts being
                    roughly fixed, the precise date appears to have varied considerably, and in some
                    cases to have lost its connection with the festivals altogether. The Ordo
                    Romanus fixes the spring fast in the first week of March (then the first month);
                    the summer fast in the second week of June; the autumnal fast in the third week
                    of September; and the winter fast in the complete week next before Christmas
                    eve. Other regulations pre vailed in different countries, until the
                    inconveniences arising from the want of uniformity led to the rule now observed
                    being laid down under Pope Urban II. as the law of the church, in the councils
                    of Placentia and Clermont, 1095 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>The present rule which fixes the ordination of clergy in the Ember weeks cannot
                    be traced further back than the time of Pope Gelasius, 492-496 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In the early ages of the church ordinations took
                    place at any season of the year whenever necessity required. Gelasius is stated
                    by ritual writers to have been the first who limited them to these particular
                    times, the special solemnity of the season being in all probability the cause of
                    the selection. The rule once introduced commended itself to the mind of the
                    church, and its observance spread. We find it laid down in the pontificate of
                    Archbishop Egbert of York, 732-766 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and referred
                    to as a canonical rule in a capitulary of Charles the Great, and it was finally
                    established as a law of the church in the pontificate of Gregory VII., c.
                    1085.</p>
