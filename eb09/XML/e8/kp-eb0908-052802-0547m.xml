                    (1680-1754), the chief founder of the Secession Church (formed of dissenters
                    from the Church of Scotland), was the son of the Rev. Henry Erskine, who at one
                    time was minister at Cornhill, North Durham, but was ejected in 1662 by the Act
                    of Uniformity, and, after suffering some years’ imprisonment, was after the
                    Revolution appointed to the parish of Chimside, Berwickshire. Ebenezer was born
                    on the 22d June 1680, most probably at Dryburgh, Berwickshire, as his parents
                    were residing there for the greater part of that year. He entered the university
                    of Edinburgh in 1693, and took his M.A. degree in 1697. He was licensed topreach
                    in 1702, and in the following year was settled in the parish of Portmoak,
                    Kinross-shire. There he remained for twenty-eight years, after which, in the
                    autumn of 1731, he was translated to the West Church, Stirling. Some time before
                    this, he along with some other ministers was “rebuked and admonished” by the
                    General Assembly for defending the doctrines contained in a book called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marrow of Modern Divinity.</hi> A sermon which he preached on
                    lay-patronage before the synod of Perth in 1733 furnished new grounds of
                    accusation, and he was compelled to shield himself from rebuke by appealing to
                    the General Assembly. Here, however, the sentence of the synod was confirmed,
                    and after many fruitless attempts to obtain a hearing, he and other three
                    ministers, Wilson, Moncrieff, and Fisher, were suspended from the office of the
                    ministry by the commission in November of that year. Against this sentence they
                    protested, and constituted themselves into a separate church court, under the
                    name of the Associate Presbytery. It'was not, however, till 1739 that they were
                    again summoned before the Assembly, when appearing in their corporate capacity
                    they declined the authority of the church, and were deposed in the following
                    year. They received numerous accessions to their communion, and remained in
                    harmony with each other till 1747, when a division took place in regard to the
                    nature of the oath administered to burgesses. Erskine joined with the “Burgher”
                    section, to whom he became professor of theology. He continued also to preach to
                    a numerous congregation in Stirling till his death, which took place on the 2d
                    June 1754. Erskine was a very popular preacher, and a man of considerable force
                    of character; and whatever opinion maybe held as to his disputes with the Church
                    of Scotland, it must be admitted that he acted throughout with an honesty and
                    courage "which are worthy of all respect. The Burgher and Anti-Burgher sections
                    of the Secession Church were reunited in 1820, and in 1847 they united with the
                    Relief Synod in forming the United Presbyterian Church. Erskine’s published
                    works consist chiefly of sermons. His <hi rend="italic">Life and Diary,</hi>
                    edited by the Rev. Donald Fraser, was published in 1840.</p>
