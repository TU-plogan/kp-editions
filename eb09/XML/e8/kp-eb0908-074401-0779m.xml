                <p>IN the former half of the 18th century, the term “evolution” was introduced into
                    biological writings, in order to denote the mode in which some of the most
                    eminent physiologists of that time conceived that the generation of living
                    things took place; in opposition to the hypothesis advocated, in the preceding
                    century, by Harvey in that remarkable work<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes de Generatione

                    biological science, even had he not been the discoverer of the circulation of
                    the blood.</p>
                <p>One of Harvey’s prime objectsis to defend and establish, on the basis of direct
                    observation, the opinion already held by Aristotle; that, in the higher animals
                    at any rate, the formation of the new organism by the process of generation
                    takes place, not suddenly, by simultaneous accretion of rudiments of all or the
                    most important of the organs of the adult; nor by sudden metamorphosis of a
                    formative substance into a miniature of the whole, which subsequently grows; but
                    by <hi rend="italic">epigenesis,</hi> or successive differentiation of a
                    relatively homogeneous rudiment into the parts and structures which are
                    characteristic of the adult.</p>

                <p>Harvey proceeds to contrast this view with that of the “Medici,” or followers of
                    Hippocrates and Galen, who, “badly philosophizing,” imagined that the brain, the
                    heart, and the liver were simultaneously first generated in the form of
                    vesicles; and, at the same time, while expressing his agreement with Aristotle
                    in the principle of epigenesis, he maintains that it is the blood which is the
                    primal generative part, and not, as Aristotle thought, the heart.</p>
                <p>In the latter part of the 17th century, the doctrine of epigenesis thus advocated
                    by Harvey was controverted on the ground of direct observation by Malpighi, who
                    affirmed that the body of the chick is to be seen in the egg before the <hi
                    rend="italic">punctum sanguineum</hi> makes its appearance. But from this
                    perfectly correct observation a conclusion which is by no means warranted was
                    drawn; namely, that the chick as a whole really exists in the egg antecedently
                    to incubation; and that what happens in the course of the latter process is no
                    addition of new parts, “alias post alias natas,” as Harvey puts it, but a simple
                    expansion or unfolding of the organs which already exist, though they are too
                    small and inconspicuous to be discovered. The weight of Malpighi’s observations
                    therefore fell into the scale of that doctrine which Harvey terms metamorphosis,
                    in contradistinction to epigenesis.</p>
                <p>The views of Malpighi were warmly welcomed on philosophical grounds by
                    Leibnitz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Cependant,
                    pour revenir aux formes ordinaires ou aux âmes matérielles, cette durée qu’il
                    leur faut attribuer, à la place de celle qu’on avoit attribuée aux atomes

                    métempsychose, à peu près comme quelques philosophes ont cru la transmission du
                    mouvement et celle des espèces. Mais cette imagination est bien éloignée de la
                    nature des choses. Il n’y a point de tel passage; et· c’est ici où les
                    transformations de Messieurs Swammerdam, Malpighi, et Leewenhoek, qui sont des
                    plus excellens observateurs de notre tems, sont venues à mon secours, et m’ont
                    fait admettre plus aisément, que l’animal, et toute autre substance organisée ne
                    commence point lorsque nous le croyons, et que sa generation apparente n’est

                    chick; and that fecundation and incubation simply cause this germ to absorb
                    nutritious matters, which are deposited in the interstices of the elementary
                    structures of which the miniature chick, or germ, is made up. The consequence of
                    this intussusceptive growth is the “development” or “evolution” of the germ into
                    the visible bird. Thus an organized individual <hi rend="italic">(tout

                <p>“Evolution” and “development” are, for Bonnet, synonymous terms; and since by
                    “evolution” he means simply the expansion of that which was invisible into
                    visibility, he was naturally led to the conclusion, at which Leibnitz had
                    arrived by a different line of reasoning, that no such thing as generation, in
                    the proper sense of the word, exists in nature. The growth of an organic being
                    is simply a process of enlargement, as a particle of dry gelatine may be swelled
                    up by the intussusception of water; its death is a shrinkage, such as the
                    swelled jelly might undergo on desiccation. Nothing really new is produced in
                    the living world, but the germs which develop have existed since the beginning
                    of things; and nothing really dies, but, when what we call death takes place,
                    the living thing shrinks back into its germ state.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bonnet had the courage of his opinions, and
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Palingénésie Philosophique,</hi> paît vi. chap, iv., he
                    develops a hypothesis which he terms “évolution naturelle;’’ and which, making
                    allowance for his peculiar views of the nature of generation, bears no small
                    resemblance to what is understood by “evolution” at the present day :—</p><p>“Si

                <p>The two parts of Bonnet’s hypothesis, namely, the doctrine that all living things
                    proceed from pre-existing germs, and that these contain, one inclosed within the
                    other, the germs of all future living things, which is the hypothesis of <hi
                    rend="italic">“emboîtement;”</hi> and the doctrine that every germ contains in
                    miniature all the organs of the adult, which is the hypothesis of evolution or
                    development, in the primary senses of these words, must be carefully
                    distinguished. In fact, while holding firmly by the former, Bonnet more or less
                    modified the latter in his later writings, and, at length, he admits that a
                    “germ” need not be an actual miniature of the organism; but that it may be
                    merely an “original preformation” capable of producing the latter.<note

                <p>But, thus defined, the germ is neither more nor less than the “particula
                    genitalis” of Aristotle, or the “primordium vegetale” or “ovum” of Harvey; and
                    the “evolution” of such a germ would not be distinguishable from
                    “epigenesis.”</p>
                <p>Supported by the great authority of Haller, the doctrine of evolution, or
                    development, prevailed throughout the whole of the 18th century, and. Cuvier
                    appears to have substantially adopted Bonnet’s later views, though probably he
                    would not have gone all lengths in the direction of “emboîtement.” In a

                    But Buffon further imagined that innumerable “molecules organiques” are
                    dispersed throughout the world, and that alimentation consists in the
                    appropriation by the parts of an organism of those molecules which are analogous
                    to them. Growth, therefore, was, on this hypothesis, partly a process of simple
                    evolution, and partly of what has been termed syngenesis. Buffon’s opinion is,
                    in fact, a sort of combination of views, essentially similar to those of Bonnet,
                    with others, somewhat similar to those ot ’ the “Medici” whom Harvey condemns.
                    The “molecules organiques” are physical equivalents of Leibnitz’s “monads.”</p>
                <p>It is a striking example of the difficulty of getting people to use their own
                    powers of investigation accurately, that this form of the doctrine of evolution
                    should have held its ground so long; for it was thoroughly and completely
                    exploded, not long after its enunciation, by Caspar Frederick Wolff, who in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Theoria Generationis,</hi> published in 1759, placed the
                    opposite theory of epigenesis upon the secure foundation of fact, from which it
                    has never been displaced. But Wolff had no immediate successors. The school of
                    Cuvier was lamentably deficient in embryologists; and it was only in the course
                    of the first thirty years of the present century, that Prévost and Dumas in
                    France, and, later on, Döllinger, Pander, Von Bär, Rathke, and Remak in Germany,
                    founded modern embryology; and, at the same time, proved the utter
                    incompatibility of the hypothesis of evolution as formulated by Bonnet and
                    Haller, with easily demonstrable facts.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, though the conceptions originally denoted by “evolution” and
                    “development” were shown to bo untenable, the words retained their application

                    appearance; and the terms “Development,” <pb break="no"

                    indiscriminately used for the series of genetic changes exhibited by living
                    beings, by writers who would emphatically deny that “Development” or
                    “Entwickelung” or “Evolutio,” in the sense in which these words were usually
                    employed by Bonnet or Haller, ever occurs.</p>
                <p>Evolution, or development, is, in fact, at present employed in biology as a
                    general name for the history of the steps by which any living being has acquired
                    the morphological and the physiological characters which distinguish it. As
                    civil history may be divided into biography, which is the history of
                    individuals, and universal history, which is the history of the human race, so
                    evolution falls naturally into two categories,—the evolution of the individual,
                    and the evolution of the sum of living beings. It will be convenient to deal
                    with the modern doctrine of evolution under these two heads.</p>

                <p>The definition of a germ as “matter potentially alive, and having within itself
                    the tendency to assum ∣ definite living form,” appears to meet all the
                    reqιr.ements of modern science. For, notwithstanding it might be justly
                    questioned whether a germ is not merely potentially, but rather actually, alive,
                    though its vital manifestations are reduced to a minimum, the term “potential”
                    may fairly be used in a sense broad enough to escape the objection. And the
                    qualification of “potential” has the advantage of reminding us that the great
                    characteristic of the germ is not so much what it is, but what it may, under
                    suitable conditions, become. Harvey shared the belief of Aristotle—whose
                    writings he so often quotes, and of whom he speaks as his precursor and model,
                    with the generous respect with which one genuine worker should regard
                    another—that such germs may arise by a process of “equivocal generation” out of
                    not-living matter; and the aphorism so commonly ascribed to him, " <hi
                    rend="italic">omne vivum</hi><hi rend="italic">ex ovo,”</hi> and which is indeed
                    a fair summary of his reiterated assertions, though incessantly employed against
                    the modern advocates of spontaneous generation, can be honestly ≡o used only by
                    those who have never read a score of pages of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exercitationes.</hi> Harvey, in fact, believed as implicitly as Aristotle did
                    in the equivocal generation of the lower animals. But, while the course of
                    modern investigation has only brought out into greater prominence the accuracy
                    of Harvey’s conception of the nature and mode of development of germs, it has as
                    distinctly tended to disprove the occurrence of equivocal generation, or
                    abiogenesis, in the present course of nature. In the immense majority of both
                    plants and animals, it is certain that the germ is not merely a body in which
                    life is dormant or potential, but that it is itself simply a detached portion of
                    the substance of a pre-existing living body; and the evidence has yet to be
                    adduced which will satisfy any cautious reasoner that</p>
                <p>“omne vivum ex vivo” is not as well established a law of the existing course of
                    nature as “omne vivum ex ovo.”</p>
                <p>-Hn all instances which have yet been investigated, the substance of this germ
                    has a peculiar chemical composition, consisting of at fewest four elementary
                    bodies, viz., carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, united into the
                    ill-defined compound known as protein, and associated with much water, and very
                    generally, if not always, with sulphur and phosphorus in minute proportions.
                    Moreover, up to the present time, protein is known only as a product and
                    constituent of living matter. Again, a true germ is either devoid of any
                    structure discernible by optical means, or, at most, it is a simple nucleated
                    cell.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In some cases of
                    sexless multiplication the germ is a cell-aggregate—if we call germ only that
                    which is already detached from the parent organism.</p></note></p>
                <p>In all cases, the process of evolution consists in a succession of changes of the
                    form, structure, and functions of the germ, by which it passes, step by step,
                    from an extreme simplicity, or relative homogeneity, of visible structure, to a
                    greater dr less degree of complexity or heterogeneity; and the course of
                    progressive differentiation is usually accompanied by growth, which is effected
                    by intussusception. This intussusception, however, is a very different process
                    from that imagined either by Buffon, or by Bonnet. The substance by the addition
                    of which the germ is enlarged is, in no case, simply absorbed ready-made from
                    the not-living world and packed between the elementary constituents of the germ,
                    as Bonnet imagined; still less does it consist of the “molecules organiques” of
                    Buffon. The new material is, in great measure, not only absorbed but
                    assimilated, so that it becomes part and parcel of the molecular structure of
                    the living body into which it enters. And, so far from the fully developed
                    organism being simply the germ <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the nutriment which
                    it has absorbed, it is probable that the adult contains neither in form, nor in
                    substance, more than an inappreciable fraction of the constitutents of the germ,
                    and that it is almost wholly made up of assimilated and metamorphosed nutriment.
                    In the great majority of cases, at any rate, the full grown organism becomes
                    what it is by the absorption of not-living matter, and its conversion into
                    living matter of a specific type. As Harvey says (Ex. 45), all parts of the body
                    are nourished “ab eodem succo alibili, aliter aliterque cambiato,” “ut plantae
                    omnes ex eodem communi nutrimento (sive rore seu terrae humore).”</p>
                <p>In all animals and plants above the lowest, the germ is a nucleated cell, using
                    that term in its broadest sense; and the first step in the process of the
                    evolution of the individual is the division of this cell into two or more
                    portions. The process of division is repeated, until the organism, from being
                    unicellular, becomes multicellular. The single cell becomes a cell-aggregate;
                    and it is to the growth and metamorphosis of the cells of the cell-aggregate
                    thus produced, that all the organs and tissues of the adult owe their
                    origin.</p>
                <p>In certain animals belonging to every one of the chief groups into which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metazoa</hi> are divisible, the cells of the cell-aggregate which
                    results from the process of yelk division, and which is termed a <hi
                    rend="italic">morula,</hi> diverge from one another in such a manner as to give
                    rise to a central space, around which they dispose themselves as a coat or
                    envelope; and thus the morula becomes a vesicle filled with fluid, the <hi
                    rend="italic">planula.</hi> The wall of the planula is next pushed in on one
                    side, or invaginated, whereby it is converted into a double walled sac with an
                    opening, the <hi rend="italic">blastospore,</hi> which leads into the cavity
                    lined by the inner wall. This cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity, or <hi

                    ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body; the hypoblast becomes the epithelium of
                    the middle portion of the alimentary canal; and the mesoblast gives rise to all
                    the other tissues, except the central nervous system, which originates from an
                    ingrowth of the epiblast.</p>
                <p>With more or less modification in detail, the embryo has been observed to pass
                    through these successive evolutional stages in sundry Sponges, Coelenterates,
                    Worms, Echinoderms, Tunicates, Arthropods, Mollusks, and Vertebrates; and there
                    are valid reasons for the belief, that all animals of higher organization than
                    the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> agree in the general character of the early
                    stages of their individual evolution. Each, starting from the condition of a
                    simple nucleated cell, becomes a cell-aggregate; and this passes through a
                    condition which represents the gastrula stage, before taking in the features
                    distinctive of the group to which it belongs. Stated in this form, the “gastraea
                    theory” of Haeckel appears to the present writer to be one of the most important
                    and best founded of recent generalizations.</p>
                <p>So far as individual plants and animals are concerned, therefore, evolution is
                    not a speculation but a fact; and it takes place by epigenesis.</p>

                <p>In these words, by the divination of genius, Harvey, in the 17th century, summed
                    up the outcome of the work of all those who, with appliances he could not dream
                    of, are continuing his labours in the 19th century.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, though the doctrine of epigenesis, as understood by Harvey, has
                    definitively triumphed over the doctrine of evolution as understood by his
                    opponents of the 18th century, it is not impossible that, when the analysis of
                    the process of development is carried still further, and the origin of the
                    molecular components of the physically gross, though sensibly minute, bodies
                    which we term germs is traced, the theory of development will approach more
                    nearly to metamorphosis than to epigenesis. Harvey thought that impregnation
                    influenced the female organism as a contagion; and that the blood, which he
                    conceived to be the first rudiment of the germ, arose in the clear fluid of the
                    “colliquamentum” of the ovum by a process of concrescence, as a sort of living
                    precipitate. We now know, on the contrary, that the female germ or ovum, in all
                    the higher animals and plants, is a body which possesses the structure of a
                    nucleated cell; that impregnation consists in the fusion of the substance<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Not yet actually demonstrated
                    in the case of the phaeuogamous plants.</p></note> of another more or less
                    modified nucleated cell, the male germ, with the ovum; and that the structural
                    components of the body of the embryo are all derived, by a process of division,
                    from the coalesced male and female germs. Hence it is conceivable, and indeed
                    probable, that every part of the adult contains molecules derived both from the
                    male and from the female parent; and that, regarded as a mass of molecules, the
                    entire organism may be compared to a web of which the warp is derived from the
                    female and the woof from the male. And each of these may constitute one
                    individuality, in the same sense as the whole organism is one individual,
                    although the matter of the organism has been constantly changing. The primitive
                    male and female molecules may play the part of Buffon’s “moules organiques,” and
                    mould the assimilated nutriment, each according to its own type, into
                    innumerable new molecules. From this point of view, the process, which, in its
                    superficial aspect, is epigenesis, appears, in essence, to be evolution, in the
                    modified sense adopted in Bonnet’s later writings; and development is merely the
                    expansion of a potential organism or “original preformation” according to fixed
                    laws.</p>

                <p>The notion that all the kinds of animals and plants may have come into existence
                    by the growth and modification of primordial germs is as old as speculative
                    thought; but the modern scientific form of the doctrine can be traced
                    historically to the influence of several converging lines of philosophical
                    speculation and of physical observation, none of which go further back than the
                    17th century. These are :—</p>

                    whether living or not living, is a mechanism, and that, as such, it is
                    explicable on physical principles.</p>
                <p>2. The observation of the gradations of structure, from extreme simplicity to
                    very great complexity, presented by living things, and of the relation of these
                    graduated forms to one another.</p>
                <p>3. The observation of the existence of an analogy between the series of
                    gradations presented by the species which compose any great group of animals or
                    plants, and the series of embryonic conditions of the highest members of that
                    group.</p>
                <p>4. The observation that large groups of species of widely different habits
                    present the same fundamental plan of structure; and that parts of the same
                    animal or plant, the functions of which are very different, likewise exhibit
                    modifications of a common plan.</p>
                <p>5. The observation of the existence of structures, in a rudimentary and
                    apparently useless condition, in one species of a group, which are fully
                    developed and have definite functions in other species of the same group.</p>
                <p>6. The observation of the effects of varying conditions in modifying living
                    organisms.</p>
                <p>7. The observation of the facts of geographical distribution.</p>
                <p> 8. The observation of the facts of the geological succession of the forms of
                    life.</p>
                <p>1. Notwithstanding the elaborate disguise which fear of the powers that were led
                    Descartes to throw over his real opinions, it is impossible to read the <hi

                    >Philosophie</hi> without acquiring the conviction that this great philosopher
                    held that the physical world and all things in it, whether living or not living,
                    have originated by a process of evolution, due to the continuous operation of
                    purely physical causes, out of a primitive relatively formless matter.<note

                    :—“L’idée de ramener l’explication de tous les phénomènes à des principes

                    faire en philosophie, et c’est Descartes qui l’a fait.”—Z.c. p.

                <p>The following passage is especially instructive :—</p>
                <p>“Et tant s’en faut que je veuille que l’on croie toutes les choses que j’écrirai,
                    que même je pretends en proposer ici quelques unes que je crois absolument être
                    fausses; à savoir, je ne doute point ?ue le monde n’ait été créé au commencement
                    avec autant de per-ection qu’il en a; en sorte que le soleil, la .terre, la

                    soi les semences des plantes, mais que les plantes même en ont couvert une
                    partie; et qu’ Adam et Eve n’ont pas été créés enfans mais en âge d’hommes
                    parfaits. La religion chrétienne veut que nous le croyons ainsi, et la raison
                    naturelle nous persuade entièrement cette vérité; car si nous considérons la

                    peu à peu dans le ventre de leurs mères et comment les plantes sortent de leurs
                    semences, que si on avoit seulement considéré quels ils ont été quand Dieu les a
                    créés: tout de même, nous ferons mieux entendre quelle est généralement la
                    nature de toutes les ehoses qui sont an monde si nous pouvons imaginer quelques
                    principes qui soient fort intelligibles et fort simples, desquels nous puissions
                    voir clairement que les astres et la terre et enfin tout ce monde visible auroit
                    pu être produit ainsi que de quelques semences (bien que nous sachions qu’il n'a
                    pas été produit en cette façon) que si nous la décrivions seulement comme il
                    est, ou bien comme nous croyons qu’il a été créé. Et parceque je pense avoir
                    trouvé des principes qui sont tels, je tacherai ici de les expliquer.”<note

                <p>If we read between the lines of this singular exhibition of force of one kind and
                    weakness of another, it is clear that Descartes believed that he had divined the
                    mode in which the physical universe had been evolved; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">homme</hi> and the
                    essay <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Passions</hi> afford
                    abundant additional evidence that he sought for, and thought he had found, an
                    explanation of the phenomena of physical life by deduction from purely physical
                    laws.</p>
                <p>Spinoza abounds in the same sense, and is as usual perfectly candid—·</p>
                <p>“Naturae leges et regulae, secundum quas omnia fiunt et ex unis formis in alias
                    mutantur, sunt ubique et semper eadem. ’<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Praefatio.</p></note></p>
                <p>Leibnitz’s doctrine of continuity necessarily led him in the same direction; and,
                    of the infinite multitude of monads with which he peopled the world, each is
                    supposed to be the focus of an endless process of evolution and involution. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Protogcea,</hi> xxvi., Leibnitz distinctly suggests the
                    mutability of species—</p>
                <p>“Alii mirantur in saxis passim species videri quas vel in orbe cognito, vel
                    saltem in vicinis locis nustra quaeras. Ita <hi rend="italic">Cornua
                    Ammonis,</hi> quae ex nautilorum numero habeantur, passim et forma et
                    magnitudine (nam et pedali diametro aliquando reperiuntur) ab omnibus illis
                    naturis discrepare dicunt, quas praebet mare. Sed quis absconditos ejus recessus
                    aut subterraneas abyssos pervestigavit? quam multa nobis animalia antea ignota
                    offert novus orbis? Et credibile est per magnas illas conversiones etiam
                    animalium species plurimum immutatas.”</p>
                <p>Thus in the end of the 17th century the seed was sown which has at intervals
                    brought forth recurrent crops of evolutional hypotheses, based, more or less
                    completely, on general reasonings.</p>
                <p>Among the earliest of these speculations is that put forward by Benoit de Maillet
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Telliamed,</hi> which, though printed in 1735, was not
                    published until twenty three years later. Considering that this book was written
                    before the time of Haller, or Bonnet, or Linnaeus, or Hutton, it surely deserves
                    more respectful consideration than it usually receives. For De Maillet not only
                    has a definite conception of the plasticity of living things, and of the.
                    production of existing species by the modification of their predecessors; but he
                    clearly apprehends the cardinal maxim of modern geological science, that the
                    explanation of the structure of the globe is to be sought in the deductive
                    application to geological phenomena of the principles established inductively by
                    the study of the present course of nature. Somewhat later, Maupertuis<note

                    causes of variation, which he thinks may be sufficient to account for the origin

                    thought as De Maillet, but less soberly; and Bonnet’s speculations in the <hi

                <p>cpιently appears to have believed that larger or smaller groups of species have
                    been produced by the modification of a primitive stock; but he contributed
                    nothing to the general doctrine of evolution.</p>
                <p>Erasmus Darwin <hi rend="italic">(Zοonοmia,</hi> 1794), though a zealous
                    evolutionist, can hardly be said to have made any real advance on his
                    predecessors; and, notwithstanding that Goethe (1791-4) had the advantage of a
                    wide knowledge of morphological facts, and a true insight into their
                    signification, while he threw all the power of a great poet into the expression
                    of his conceptions, it may be questioned whether he supplied the doctrine of
                    evolution with a firmer scientific basis than it already possessed. Moreover,
                    whatever the value of Goethe’s labours in that field, they were not published
                    before 1820, long after evolutionism had taken a new departure from the works of
                    Treviranus and Lamarck—the first of its advocates who were equipped for their
                    task with the needful large and accurate knowledge of the phenomena of life, as
                    a whole. It is remarkable that each of these writers seems to have been led,
                    independently and contemporaneously, to invent the same name of “Biology” for
                    the science of the phenomena of life; and thus, following Buffon, to have
                    recognized the essential unity of these phenomena, and their contradistinction
                    from those of inanimate nature. And it is hard to say whether Lamarck or
                    Treviranus has the priority in propounding the main thesis of the doctrine of
                    evolution; for though the first volume of Treviranus’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biologie</hi> appeared only in 1802, he says, in the preface to his later work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Erscheinungen und Gesetze des organischen Lehens,</hi>
                    dated 1831, that he wrote the first volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biologie</hi> “nearly five-and-thirty years ago,” or about 1796.</p>
                <p>Now, in 1794, there is evidence that Lamarck held doctrines which present a
                    striking contrast to those which are to be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophie Zoologique,</hi> as the following passages show :—</p>
                <p>685. Quoique mon unique objet dans cet article n’ait été que de traiter de la
                    cause physique de l’entretien de la vie des êtres organiques, malgré cela j'ai
                    osé avancer en débutant, que l’existence de ces êtres étonnants n'appartiennent
                    nullement à la nature; que tout ce qu on peut entendre par le mot <hi
                    rend="italic">nature,</hi> ne pouvoit donner la vie, c’est-à-dire, que toutes
                    les qualités de la matière, jointes à toutes les circonstances possibles, et
                    même à l’activité répandue dans l’univers, ne pouvaient point produire un être
                    muni du mouvement organique, capable de reproduire son semblable, et sujet à la
                    mort.</p>
                <p>686. Tous les individus de cette nature, qui existent, proviennent d’individus
                    semblables qui tous ensemble constituent l’espèce entière. Or, je crois qu’il
                    est aussi impossible à l’homme de connôitre la cause physique du premier
                    individu de chaque espèce, que d’assigner aussi physiquement la cause de
                    l’existence de la matière ou de l’univers entier. C’est au moins ce que le
                    résultat de mes connaissances et de mes réflexions me portent à penser. S’il
                    existe beaucoup de variétés produites par l’effet des circonstances, ces
                    variétés ne dénaturent point les espèces; mais on se trompe, sans doute souvent,
                    en indiquant comme espèce, ce qui n’est que variété; et alors je sens que cette
                    erreur peut tirer à conséquence dans les raisonnements que l’on fait sur cette
                    matière.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    authority of Cuvier was employed in support of the traditionally respectable
                    hypotheses of special creation and of catastrophism; and the wild speculations
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Discours sur les</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Devolutions</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Surface du Globe</hi> were held to be

                <p>Nevertheless, the work had been done. The conception of evolution was

                    which have brought about the present condition of living matter, assuming such
                    matter to have once come into existence. On the other hand, Mr Spencer<note

                    and vigorous writings of Mr Spencer embody the spirit of Descartes in the
                    knowledge of our own day, and may be regarded as the “Principes des Philosophie”
                    of the 19th century; while, whatever hesitation may not unfrequently be felt by
                    less daring minds, in following Haeckel in many of his speculations, his attempt
                    to systematize the doctrine of evolution and to exhibit its influence as the
                    central thought of modern biology, cannot fail to have a far-reaching influence
                    on the progress of science.</p>
                <p>If we seek for the reason of the difference between the scientific position of
                    the doctrine of evolution a century ago, and that which it occupies now, we
                    shall find it in the great accumulation of facts, the several classes of .which
                    have been enumerated above, under the second to the eighth heads. For those
                    which are grouped under the second to the seventh of these classes,
                    respectively, have a clear significance on the hypothesis of evolution, while
                    they are unintelligible if that hypothesis be denied. And those of the eighth
                    group are not only unintelligible without the assumption of evolution, but can
                    be proved never to be discordant with that hypothesis, while, in some cases,
                    they are exactly such as the hypothesis requires. The demonstration of these
                    assertions would require a volume, but the general nature of the evidence on
                    which they rest may be briefly indicated.</p>
                <p>2. The accurate investigation of the lowest forms of animal life, commenced by
                    Leeuwenhoek and Swammerdam, and continued by the remarkable labours of Reaumur,
                    Trembley, Bonnet, and a host of other observers in the latter part of the 17th
                    and the first half of the 18th centuries, drew the attention of biologists to
                    the gradation in the complexity of organization which is presented by living
                    beings, and culminated in the doctrine of the “échelle des êtres,” so powerfully
                    and clearly stated by Bonnet; and, before him, adumbrated by Locke and by
                    Leibnitz. In the then state of knowledge, it appeared that all the species of
                    animals and plants could be arranged in one series; in such a manner that, by
                    insensible gradations, the mineral passed into the plant, the plant into the
                    polype, the polype into the worm, and so, through gradually higher forms of
                    life, to man, at the summit of the animated world.</p>
                <p>But, as knowledge advanced, this conception ceased to be tenable in the crude
                    form in which it was first put forward. Taking into account existing animals and
                    plants alone, it became obvious that they fell into groups which were more or
                    less sharply separated from one another; and, moreover, that even the species of
                    a genus can hardly ever be arranged in linear series. Their natural resemblances
                    and differences are only to be expressed by disposing them as if they were
                    branches springing from a common hypothetical centre.</p>
                <p>Lamarck, while affirming the verbal proposition that animals form a single
                    series, was forced by his vast acquaintance with the details of zoology to limit
                    the assertion to such a series as may be formed out of the abstractions
                    constituted by the common characters of each group.<note anchored="true"

                    masses principales qui la composent et non dans celle des espèces ni même
                    toujours dans celle des genres. ”— <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Cuvier on anatomical, and Von Baer on embryological grounds, made the further
                    step of proving that, even in this limited sense, animals cannot be arranged in
                    a single series, but that there are several distinct plans of organization to be
                    observed among them, no one of which, in its highest and most complicated
                    modification, leads to any of the others.</p>
                <p>The conclusions enunciated by Cuvier and Von Baer have been confirmed in
                    principle by all subsequent research into the structure of animals and plants.
                    But the effect of the adoption of these conclusions has been rather to
                    substitute a new metaphor for that of Bonnet than to abolish the conception
                    expressed by it. Instead of regarding living things as capable of arrangement in
                    one series like the steps of a ladder, the results of modern investigation
                    compel us to dispose them as if they were the twigs and branches of a tree. The
                    ends of the twigs represent individuals, the smallest groups of twigs species,
                    larger groups genera, and so on, until we arrive at the source of all these
                    ramifications of the main branch, which is represented by a common plan of
                    structure. At the present moment, it is impossible to draw up any definition,
                    based on broad anatomical or developmental characters, by which any one of
                    Cuvier’s great groups shall be separated from all the rest. On the contrary, the
                    lower members of each tend to converge towards the lower members of all the
                    others, The same may be said of the vegetable world. The apparently clear
                    distinction between flowering and flowerless plants has been broken down by the
                    series of gradations between the two exhibited by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycopodiaceoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Iihizocarpece,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    run into one another, and, when the lowest forms of each are alone considered,
                    even the animal and vegetable kingdoms cease to have a definite frontier.</p>
                <p>If it is permissible to speak of the relations of living forms to one another
                    metaphorically, the similitude chosen must undoubtedly be that of a common root,
                    whence two main trunks, one representing the vegetable and one the animal world,
                    spring; and, each dividing into a few main branches, these subdivide into
                    multitudes of branchlets and these into smaller groups of twigs.</p>

                    1811.</p></note> Meckel remarks</p>
                <p>“There is no good physiologist who has not been struck by the observation that
                    the original form of all organisms is one and the same, and that out of this one
                    form, all, the lowest as well as the highest, are developed in such a manner
                    that the latter pass through the permanent forms of the former as transitory
                    stages. Aristotle, Haller, Harvey, Kielmeyer, Autenrieth, and many others have
                    either made this observation incidentally, or, especially the latter, have drawn
                    particular attention to it, and drawn therefrom results of permanent importance
                    for physiology.”</p>
                <p>Meckel proceeds to exemplify the thesis, that the lower forms of animals
                    represent stages in the course of the development of the higher, with a large
                    series of illustrations.</p>
                <p>After comparing the Salamanders and the perennibranchiate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urodela</hi> with the Tadpoles and the Frogs, and enunciating the law that the
                    more highly any animal is organized the more quickly does it pass through the
                    lower stages, Meckel goes on to say—</p>
                <p>“From these lowest Vertebrata to the highest, and to the highest forms among
                    these, the comparison between the embryonic conditions of the higher animals and
                    the adult states of the lower can be more completely and thoroughly instituted
                    than if the survey is extended to the Invertebrata, inasmuch as the latter are
                    in many respects constructed upon an altogether too dissimilar type; indeed they
                    often differ from one another far more than the lowest vertebrate does from the
                    highest mammal; yet the following pages will show that the comparison may be
                    also extended to them with interest. I n fact, there is a period when, as
                    Aristotle long ago said, the embryo of the highest animal has the form of a mere
                    worm, and, devoid of internal and external organization, is merely an almost
                    structureless lump of polype-substance. Notwithstanding the origin of organs, it
                    still for a certain time, by reason of its want of an internal bony skeleton,
                    remains worm and mollusk, and only later enters into the series of the
                    Vertebrata, although traces of the vertebral column even in the earliest periods
                    testify its claim to a place in that series.”— <hi rend="italic">Op. cit.</hi>
                    pp. 4, 5.</p>
                <p>If Meckel’s proposition is so far qualified, that the comparison of adult with
                    embryonic forms is restricted within the limits of one type of organization;
                    and, if it is further recollected, that the resemblance between the permanent
                    lower form and the embryonic stage of a higher form is not special but general,
                    it is in entire accordance with modern embryology; although there is no branch
                    of biology which has grown so largely, and improved its methods so much since
                    Meckel’s time, as this. In its original form, the doctrine of “arrest of
                    development,” as advocated by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Serres, was no doubt an
                    over-statement of the case. It is not true, for example, that a fish is a
                    reptile arrested in its development, or that a reptile was ever a fish; but it
                    is true that the reptile embryo, at one stage of its development, is an organism
                    which, if it had an independent existence, must be classified among fishes; and
                    all the organs of the reptile pass, in the course of their development, through
                    conditions which are closely analogous to those which are permanent in some
                    fishes.</p>
                <p>4. That branch of biology which is termed Morphology is a commentary upon, and
                    expansion of, the proposition that widely different animals or plants, and
                    widely different parts of animals or plants, are constructed upon the same plan.
                    From the rough comparison of the skeleton of a bird with that of a man by Belon,
                    in the sixteenth century (to go no further back), down to the theory of the
                    limbs and the theory of the skull at the present day; or, from the first
                    demonstration of the homologies of the parts of a flower by C. F. Wolff, to the
                    present elaborate analysis of the floral organs, morphology exhibits a continual
                    advance towards the demonstration of a fundamental unity among the seeming
                    diversities of living structures. And this demonstration has been completed by
                    the final establishment of the cell theory, which involves the admission of a
                    primitive conformity, not only of all the elementary structures in animals and
                    plants respectively, but of those in the one of these great divisions of living
                    things with those in the other. No <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> difficulty
                    can be said to stand in the way of evolution, when it can be shown that all
                    animals and all plants proceed by modes of development, which are similar in
                    principle, from a fundamental protoplasmic material.</p>
                <p>5. The innumerable cases of structures, which are rudimentary and apparently
                    useless, in species, the close allies of which possess well developed and
                    functionally important homologous structures, are readily intelligible on the
                    theory of evolution, while it is hard to conceive their <hi rend="italic"
                    >raison</hi><hi rend="italic">Tetre</hi> on any other hypothesis. However, a
                    cautious reasoner will probably rather explain such cases deductively from the
                    doctrine of evolution, than endeavour to support the doctrine of evolution by
                    them. For it is almost impossible to prove that any structure, however
                    rudimentary, is useless—that is to say, that it plays no part whatever in the
                    economy; and, if it is in the slightest degree useful, there is no reason why,
                    on the hypothesis of direct creation, it should not have been created.
                    Nevertheless, double-edged as is the argument from rudimentary organs, there is
                    probably none which has produced a greater effect in promoting the general
                    acceptance of the theory of evolution.</p>
                <p>6. The older advocates of evolution sought for the causes of the process
                    exclusively in the influence of varying conditions, such as climate and station,
                    or hybridization, upon living forms. Even Treviranus has got no further than
                    this point. Lamarck introduced the conception of the action of an animal on
                    itself as a factor in producing modification. Starting from the well-known fact
                    that the habitual use of a limb tends to develop the muscles of the limb, and to
                    produce a greater and greater facility in using it, he made the general
                    assumption that the effort of an animal to exert an organ in a given direction
                    tends to develop the organ in that direction. But a little consideration showed
                    that, though Lamarck had seized what, as far as it goes, is a true cause of
                    modification, it is a cause the actual effects of which are wholly inadequate to
                    account for any considerable modification in animals, and which can have no
                    influence at all in the vegetable world; and probably nothing contributed so
                    much to discredit evolution, in the early part of this century, as the floods of
                    easy ridicule which were poured upon this part of Lamarck’s speculation. The
                    theory of natural selection, or survival of the fittest, was suggested by Wells
                    in 1813, and further elaborated by Matthew in 1831. But the pregnant suggestions
                    of these writers remained practically unnoticed and forgotten, until the theory
                    was independently devised and promulgated by Darwin and Wallace in 1858, and the
                    effect of its publication was immediate and profound.</p>
                <p>Those who were unwilling to accept evolution, without better grounds than such as
                    are offered by Lamarck or tho author of that particularly unsatisfactory book,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of the Creation,</hi> and
                    who therefore preferred to suspend their judgment on the question, found in the
                    principle of selective breeding, pursued in all its ap- · plications with
                    marvellous knowledge and skill by Mr Dar-· win, a valid explanation of the
                    occurrence of varieties and races; and they saw clearly that, if the explanation
                    would <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n786/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0786-0751"/> apply to species, it would not only solve the
                    problem of their evolution, but that it would account for the facts of
                    teleology, as well as for those of morphology; and for the persistence of some
                    forms of life unchanged through long epochs of time, while others undergo
                    comparatively rapid metamorphosis.</p>
                <p>How far “natural selection” suffices for the production of species remains to be
                    seen. Few can doubt that, if not the whole cause, it is a very important factor
                    in that operation; and that it must play a great part in the sorting out of
                    varieties into those which are transitory aud those which are permanent.</p>
                <p>But the causes and conditions of variation have yet to be thoroughly explored;
                    and the importance of natural selection will not be impaired, even if further
                    inquiries should prove that variability is definite, and is determined in
                    certain directione rather than in others, by conditions inherent in that which
                    varies. It is quite conceivable that every species tends to produce varieties of
                    a limited number and kind, and that the effect of natural selection is to favour
                    the development of some of these, while it opposes the development of others
                    along their predetermined lines of modification.</p>
                <p>7. No truths brought to light by biological investigation were better calculated
                    to inspire distrust of the dogmas intruded upon science in the name of theology,
                    than those which relate to the distribution of animals and plants on the surface
                    of the earth. Very skilful accommodation was needful, if the limitation of
                    sloths to South America, and of the ornithorhynchus to Australia, was to be
                    reconciled with the literal interpretation of the history of the deluge; and,
                    with the establishment of the existence of distinct provinces of distribution,
                    any serious belief in the peopling of the world by migration from Mount Ararat
                    came to an end.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, only one alternative was left for those who denied the
                    occurrence of evolution; namely, the supposition that the characteristic animals
                    and plants of each great province were created, as such, within the limits in
                    which we find them. And as the hypothesis of “specific centres,” thus
                    formulated, was heterodox from the theological point of view, and unintelligible
                    under its scientific aspect, it may be passed over without further notice, as a
                    phase of transition from the creational to the evolutional hypothesis.</p>
                <p>8. In fact, the strongest and most conclusive arguments in favour of evolution
                    are those which are based upon the facts of geographical, taken in conjunction
                    with those of geological, distribution.</p>
                <p>Both Mr Darwin and Mr Wallace lay great stress on the close relation which
                    obtains between the existing fauna of any region and that of the immediately
                    antecedent geological epoch in the same region; and rightly, for it is in truth
                    inconceivable that there should be no genetic connection between the two. It is
                    possible to put into words the proposition, that all the animals and plants of
                    each geological epoch were annihilated, and that a new set of very similar forms
                    was created for the next epoch, but it may be doubted if any one who ever tried
                    to form a distinct mental image of this process of spontaneous generation on the
                    grandest scale, ever really succeeded in realizing it.</p>
                <p>Within the last twenty years, the attention of the best palaeontologists has been

                    say that the successive forms of the Equine type have been fully worked out;
                    while those of nearly all the other existing types of Ungulate mammals and of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> have been nearly as closely followed
                    through the Tertiary deposits; the gradations between birds and reptiles have
                    been traced; and the modifications undergone by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crocodilia,</hi> from the Triassic epoch to the present day, have been
                    demonstrated. On the evidence of palaeontology, the evolution of many existing
                    forms of animal life from their predecessors is no longer an hypothesis, but an
                    historical fact; it is only the nature of the physiological factors to which
                    that evolution is due which is still open to discussion. (τ. π. <hi

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Evolution in Philosophy.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Definition.—</hi> The modern biological doctrine of evolution, which regards
                    the higher forms of life as gradually arising out of the lower, owes its chief
                    philosophic significance to the fact that it renders definite and precise one
                    part of a general theory of the world viewed as an orderly succession of events
                    or as a process of becoming. This theory is put forward as an answer to one of
                    the two problems of philosophy conceived as an interpretation of real existence.
                    The first of these problems concerns itself with what may be called the statical
                    aspect of the world, and inquires into the ultimate nature of all reality
                    (matter and mind), viewed as coexistent and apart from time. The second problem
                    treats of the dynamical aspect of the world, and has to do with the process by
                    which the totality of things has come to be what it is, and is still being
                    transformed. It is this latter problem which the various theories of evolution
                    seek to solve.</p>
                <p>The most general meaning of evolution may be defined as follows: Evolution
                    includes all theories respecting the origin and order of the world which regard
                    the higher or more complex forms of existence as following and depending on the
                    lower and simple forms, which represent the course of the world as a gradual
                    transition from the indeterminate to the determinate, from the uniform to the
                    varied, and which assume the cause of this process to be immanent in the world
                    itself that is thus transformed. All theories of evolution, properly so called,
                    regard the physical world as a gradual progress from the simple to the complex,
                    look upon the development of organic life as conditioned by that of the
                    inorganic world, and view the course of mental life both of the individual and
                    of the race as correlated with a material process. This definition covers
                    roughly the principal historical systems bearing the name of evolution, as well
                    as others which have hardly as yet been characterized by this title.</p>
                <p>It is clear by this definition that we cannot now press the etymological force of
                    the word. Evolution has no doubt often been conceived as an unfolding of
                    something already contained in the original, and this view is still commonly
                    applied to organic evolution both of the individual and.of the species. It will
                    be found that certain metaphysical systems of evolution imply this idea of an
                    unfolding of something existing in germ or at least potentially in the
                    antecedent. On the other hand, the modern doctrine of evolution, with its ideas
                    of elements which combine, and of causation as transformation of energy, does
                    not necessarily imply this notion. It may be remarked that some of the arguments
                    brought against the modern doctrine rest on the fallacious assumption that the
                    word is still used in its etymological sense, and that consequently that which
                    evolves must contain in some shape what is evolved (e.y., inorganic matter must
                    contain life and consciousness).</p>
                <p>Evolution is thus almost synonymous with progress, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n787/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0787-0752"/> though the latter term is usually confined to
                    processes of development in the moral as distinguished from the physical world.
                    Further, this idea, as Mr Spencer remarks, has rather a subjective than an
                    objective source, since it points to an increased <hi rend="italic">value</hi>
                    in existence as judged by our feelings. At the same time, inasmuch as conscious
                    and more particularly human life is looked on by the evolutionist as the highest
                    phase of all development, and since man’s development is said to be au increase
                    in well-being and happiness, we do not greatly err when we speak of evolution as
                    a transition from the lower to the higher, from the worse to the better. Another
                    respect in which the whole process of evolution may be said to be a progress is
                    in its relation to our perceptions as aesthetic spectators, the higher phases of
                    the process being the more varied, the fuller, and the more perfect. Apart from
                    these subjective estimates, evolution is first of all as a whole a progress from
                    the lower to the higher, in the sense that it is a substitution of a complex for
                    a simple type of existence; and it is such a progress, secondly, in the narrow
                    sense of organic development if not in the wider sense of cosmic development,
                    inasmuch as all advance implies a larger measure of adaptation and so of
                    permanence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problems solved by Evolution.—</hi> The hypothesis of evolution
                    aims at answering a number of questions respecting the becoming or genesis of
                    things. Of these the first is the problem of explaining change, that is to say,
                    of accounting for that incessant process of transformation which the world
                    manifests. The form which this question has commonly taken is, “What is motion,
                    and how does it arise 1” The second inquiry relates to the factor of
                    intelligible order in the world, to the existence of general classes of things,
                    including minds, of universal laws, and finally to that appearance of a rational
                    end towards which things tend. Thirdly, it is necessary to account for the
                    origin of organic beings which appear to be subordinated to different principles
                    from those which control inorganic bodies. Lastly, we have the apparent mystery
                    of a genesis of conscious minds in dependence on physical bodies. These are the
                    principal inquiries which the various theories of evolution aim more or less
                    completely at answering. As a subordinate question, we may mention the meaning
                    of human history, and its relation to physical processes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Evolution, Creation, and Emanation.—</hi> In seeking to answer
                    these questions, the hypothesis of an evolution of the cosmos with all that it
                    contains competes, in part at least, with two other principal doctrines
                    respecting the origin of the world. These are the theory of direct creation by a
                    personal Deity and that of emanation.</p>
                <p>It is clear that the doctrine of evolution is directly antagonistic to that of
                    creation. Just as the biological doctrine of the transmutation of species is
                    opposed to that of special creations, so the idea of evolution as applied to the
                    formation of the world as a whole, is opposed to that of a direct creative
                    volition. It substitutes within the ground which it covers the idea of a natural
                    and necessary process for that of an arbitrary volitional process.</p>
                <p>The theory of a personal Creator answers the questions enumerated above by
                    referring the form of the world to an act of direct creation. As an extreme
                    doctrine, it views matter as well as form as the product of divine volition; in
                    a modified form, it conceives the Deity as simply fashioning the uncreated
                    material of the world; and in a still more restricted form, it regards the
                    universal laws or forms which are impressed on things as co-eternal with the
                    Deity. Advancing knowledge has gradually limited the sphere of direct creative
                    activity, by referring the present order of the world to the action of secondary
                    causes. Hence this theory only now competes with the hypothesis of evolution at
                    one or two pointe, more especially the production of living forms, the origin of
                    the human mind, and the nature of history,—which last is conceived as somehow
                    controlled by divine action in the shape of Providence. The question how far the
                    doctrine of evolution, in its most extended and elaborate form, absolutely
                    excludes the idea of creative activity need not be dwelt on here. It is
                    sufficient to say that the theory of evolution, by assuming an intelligible and
                    adequate principle of change, simply eliminates the notion of creation from
                    those regions of existence to which it is applied.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of emanation, which had its origin in the East, and was developed by
                    the Neoplatouists, Gnostics, and Cabalists, is a philosophic transformation of
                    the idea of an original creation of the world. It regards the world as a product
                    of the divine nature, and so far it is a theory of creation. On the other hand,
                    it conceives of this production as necessary, and analogous rather to a physical
                    than to a moral action. In this respect it agrees with the doctrine of
                    evolution. It further coincides with this doctrine in the recognition of a scale
                    of existence. It differs from this last inasmuch as it reverses the order of
                    evolution, by making the original stage the most perfect and all later stages a
                    succession of degradations. In one respect, the theory of emanation has a
                    curious relation to that of evolution. As we have seen, the process of evolution
                    is from the indeterminate to the determinate. This is often expressed as a
                    progress from the universal to the particular. Thus the primordial matter
                    assumed by the early Greek physicists may be said to be the universal substance
                    out of which particular things arise. The doctrine of emanation again regards
                    the world as a process of particularization. Yet the resemblance bereis more
                    apparent than real. The universal is, as Mr Spencer remarks, a subjective idea;
                    and the general forms, existing <hi rend="italic">ante res,</hi> which play so
                    prominent apart in Greek and mediaeval philosophy, do notin the least correspond
                    to the homogeneous matter of the physical evolutionists. The one process is a
                    logical operation, the other a physical. The theory of emanation, which had its
                    source in certain moral and religious ideas, aims first of all at explaining the
                    origin of mental or spiritual existence as an effluence from the divine and
                    absolute spirit. In the next place, it seeks to account for the general laws of
                    the world, for the universal forms of existence, as ideas which emanate from the
                    Deity. By some it was developed into a complete philosophy of the world, in
                    which matter itself is viewed as the lowest emanation from the absolute. In this
                    form it stands in sharp antithesis to the doctrine of evolution, both because
                    the former views the world of particular things and events as essentially unreal
                    and illusory; and because the latter, so far as it goes, looks on matter as
                    eternal, and seeks to explain the general forms of things as we perceive them by
                    help of simpler assumptions. In certain theories known as doctrines of
                    emanation, only mental existence is referred to the absolute source, while
                    matter is viewed as eternal and distinct from the divine nature. In this form
                    the doctrine of emanation approaches, as we shall see, certain forms of the
                    evolution theory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forms of Doctrine of Evolution.—</hi> Let us now see how the
                    doctrine of evolution deals with the problems of becoming as above defined. And
                    here it becomes necessary to distinguish between different w ays of formulating
                    and interpreting the idea of evolution. The various modes of conceiving and
                    interpreting the idea of a natural evolution of things depend on the answers
                    given to thι¾e principal questions respecting the nature and causes of the
                    process. These are :—I. How far is the process a real objective one? II. What is
                    the nature of that reality which makes the content, so to speak, of the process
                    of evolution? and III. How is the process effected?</p>
                <p>I. First of all, very different views may be taken of the reality of the process
                    of becoming, generation, and transformation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0788-0753"/>. On the oneside we have the extreme view of
                    theElea-tics, that there is no such thing as change or individual object, that
                    real being is one and unchangeable, and that what appears like the formation and
                    destruction of things is an illusion of the senses. At the other extreme we have
                    the view that all reality consists in the process of becoming, or
                    selfrealization, and that nothing persists save this law of evolution itself.
                    Between these two extremes there lie a number of intermediate conceptions, as
                    that of a varying and progressive activity, of a persistent force, or of a
                    gradual manifestation of an unchanging substance. The reality of the process is
                    viewed in a peculiar light from the stand-point of modern Subjective Idealism,
                    which regards time as nothing but a mental form. It is to be added that the
                    process of cosmic evolution may present different degrees of reality. Thus to
                    the ancient atomists the real part of the process is the combination of atoms.
                    There is no absolute generation or destruction of things. Further, the evolution
                    of the world of sensible qualities (colour, &lt;tc.) of things, is illusory, and
                    has only a subjective existence in our sensations. The modern scientific
                    doctrine of evolution carries out this view of its reality, both by its
                    conception of the material world as objectively real only in its forces and
                    movements, and by its doctrine of the conservation of energy, which teaches that
                    amid all change and transformation there is something (though not necessarily a
                    metaphysical thing) which persists.</p>
                <p>II. Secondly, the view of evolution will vary according to the conception of that
                    substance or real thing which enters into the process and constitutes its
                    essential content. We have said that the problems of being and becoming <hi
                    rend="italic">(esse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fieri)</hi> are distinct, yet
                    they cannot be discussed in perfect isolation. More particularly our idea of
                    becoming must be determined by our notion of that existing reality which
                    underlies the process.</p>
                <p>It follows from our definition of evolution that its main problem is to conceive
                    of material and mental development in their mutual relation. There are various
                    ways of effecting this result First of all, the material and the mental may be
                    regarded from a dualistic point of view as perfectly distinct kinds of reality.
                    According to this view, physical evolution as taking place in the inorganic
                    world, and mental evolution as unfolded in man’s history, are two unconnected
                    processes. Further, the fact of their correlation in organic development must
                    either be left unexplained altogether, or can only be referred to the arbitrary
                    action of some supernatural power.</p>
                <p>Opposed to this dualistic conception of reality there are the monistic
                    conceptions, which conceive of all parts of the process of evolution as
                    homogeneous and identical. Of these the first is the materialistic, which
                    assumes but one substance, and regards mind as but a property or particular
                    manifestation of matter. On this view, mental evolution is simply one phase of
                    material, and the whole course of cosmic evolution may be described as a
                    production of mind out of matter.</p>
                <p>The next monistic conception is the spiritualistic, which assumes but one
                    substance—mind, and resolves the reality of the material world into a spiritual
                    principle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of course,
                    there is a transition from the dualistic theory to the spiritualistic in those
                    doctrines which allow a certain reality to matter, but only as something dead or
                    existing potentially.</p></note> According to this way of looking at the
                    world-process, material and mental evolution are but two continuous phases of
                    one spiritual movement. From the operation of inanimate nature up to human
                    history it is the same spiritual reality which manifests itself.</p>
                <p>Finally, there is the monistic conception in the narrow modern sense, viz., that
                    which views the material and the mental as two sides of one and the same
                    reality. Accord ing to this view, physical evolution as manifested in the
                    material world, and mental evolution as seen in human life, may each be regarded
                    as a two-sided process. The first is simply that part of the process in which
                    the material side is most conspicuous; the second, that in which the mental side
                    is so. This monistic conception shows itself in a number of forms,—from the
                    crude semi-mythological conception of a cosmic organism or world-animal, which
                    is at once body and soul, up to the metaphysical doctrine of one substance with
                    two attributes.</p>
                <p>III. In the third place, the form of the doctrine of evolution will vary
                    according to the conception of the force or activity which effects the process.
                    This point, though closely related to the last, is not identical with it. It is
                    one thing to understand <hi rend="italic">what</hi> it is that evolves itself,
                    another thing to comprehend <hi rend="italic">how</hi> the process is brought
                    about. The latter point is of even greater importance for studying the various
                    theories of evolution than the former.</p>
                <p>There are two strongly contrasted modes of viewing all action or change. The
                    first is drawn from the region of physical events, and views the change as
                    conditioned by antecedents or efficient causes. This way of looking at change
                    gives the mechanical view of evolution. The second is drawn from the region of
                    our conscious volitions regarded as themselves undetermined by antecedent
                    causes, and conceives of change as related to and determined by some end or
                    purpose. This gives the teleological view of evolution. Although there is a
                    natural affinity between the mechanical and the materialistic conception of
                    evolution on the one side, and between the teleological and the spiritualistic
                    on the other, they are not exactly co-extensive. The teleological view does no
                    doubt imply the acceptance of a spiritual or quasi-spiritual principle; it
                    refers the form and order of the world to the action of an intelligence
                    (conscious or unconscious) which combines particular events as means to some
                    comprehensive end. The mechanical view, on the other hand, does not necessarily
                    imply the acceptance of a material principle as the one reality. It is
                    applicable to mind as well as to body. Thus, on the determinist theory, mental
                    development is as much a mechanical process as physical development.</p>
                <p>Adopting this distinction between the mechanical and teleological conception of
                    evolution as the essential one, we may roughly classify the various systems of
                    evolution under the three heads :— <hi rend="italic">(a),</hi> those in which
                    the mechanical view predominates; (δ), those in which the teleological view
                    predominates; and (c), those in which the two views are combined in some larger
                    conception.</p>
                <p>(a) The mechanical interpretation may first of all be combined with a dualistic
                    theory. Such would be Descartes’s doctrine of evolution if it had been fully
                    worked out on its mental side. It has been observed, however, that the
                    mechanical view is naturally allied to the materialistic theory. Systems of
                    evolution which arise out of this combination seek to resolve all appearance of
                    order and purpose in the physical world into the combined effect of elementary
                    forces or actions. They adopt a mechanical conception of organic bodies and
                    their processes. Finally, they regard mental life and its evolution as a process
                    of combination exactly analogous to that of physical evolution and closely
                    correlated with a certain mode of this process. In this way they lead to a
                    materialistic conception of man’s origin and development as conditioned by
                    physical circumstances and organic changes.</p>
                <p>This thorough-going materialistic way of viewing the origin and formation of the
                    world finds its greatest obstacle in the genesis of conscious life. Hence it has
                    from the earliest been modified in one or two ways so as to provide a primordial
                    source of sensation and thought, without, however, abandoning a strictly
                    mechanical<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0789-0754"/> view of the process. The first and crude form in
                    which this modification presents itself is that of an original, thin,
                    quasi-material substance (as ether), which may serve as the raw material, so to
                    speak, of individual minds. The formation of these minds, however, is regarded
                    as a strictly mechanical process, and related to that of physical evolution in
                    t.ιe narrow sense. This theory of the origin of mental existence clearly
                    approaches one of the forms of the doctrine of emanation already referred to. We
                    have only to conceive of the primordial mental substance as the infinite being,
                    transcending our finite world, and the doctrine becomes one of emanation. The
                    second modification of this view consists in the theory that all parts of matter
                    are endowed with sensibility, but that the sensations are not themselves (as
                    teleological factors) the productive force in the process, but are rather the
                    appendages of the real factors. The world forms itself according to strictly
                    mechanical laws of combination, and the evolution of the various grades of mind
                    in the organic region takes place by a composition of elementary feelings
                    exactly similar to the process of material combination.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the systems which are based on the mechanical view, a bare
                    allusion must be made to a recent suggestion that all things consist ultimately
                    of mental substance (“mind-stuff”), which combines itself both in the material
                    world and in the region of conscious mind according to strictly mechanical
                    principles.</p>
                <p>(ό) The second mode of viewing the process of evolution subordinates the idea of
                    physical cause to that of final cause. The force which effects the continual
                    production and transformation of things is conceived of more or less distinctly
                    after the analogy of a rational impulse towards an end, and the process is
                    regarded as determined or conditioned by this element of purpose.</p>
                <p>This teleological view of evolution may be found in a number of systems of
                    nature, which look on the material world as at once bodily and vital or
                    spiritual, though it is often difficult to say whether any particular system
                    should be called dualistic or monistic (in the narrow sense). Thus we have the
                    evolution of the physical world referred to a vital principle which pervades all
                    matter, and of which the essential nature is productivity, to a formative
                    plastic principle which moulds the dead material into various shapes, to an
                    organizing cosmic force, and so on. In all these conceptions, which appear to
                    aim more especially at an explanation of organic forms and life, the element of
                    purpose appears in a nascent shape. Nature is personified as a worker who aims
                    unconsciously and instinctively at some dimly descried end, such as the most
                    various production, the progressive manifestation of life, and so on. In some of
                    these systems, notably in the Aristotelian, the genesis of conscious mind is
                    explained along with that of organic life by means of the supposition that mind
                    is but the formative principle of the individual organism.</p>
                <p>The idea of purpose becomes more definite, and, at the same time, a further step
                    is taken towards the explanation of mental life as a development out of
                    physical, in those systems which project a distinct spiritual principle into
                    nature. The way in which this is frequently done is by means of the theory of a
                    world-soul which animates the whole of the material world and directs all parts
                    of its evolution. When this spiritual principle is regarded not only as the
                    formative force, but also as the substantial source of conscious mental life,
                    which has eternally coexisted, with matter, we have, as already remarked, a
                    pantheistic conception of evolution which, like another and cognate conception
                    already referred to, approximates to one form of the emanation theory.</p>
                <p>The full development of this way of regarding the world ana its evolution as the
                    work of a spiritual principle aiming towards an end is to be found in certain
                    doctrines of Objective Idealism, which resolve all material existence into a
                    mode of mental existence—will and thought. These theories clearly simplify the
                    conception of evolution to the utmost, by the identification both of the
                    substantial reality which enters into all parts of the world-process, and of the
                    rationale of all parts of the process itself. In the systems now referred to,
                    the mechanical idea is wholly taken up into the teleological. Purpose is the
                    highest law of things, and it is one purpose which manifests itself through all
                    stages of the world’s evolution,—in the region of inorganic nature, of organic
                    life, and of human history. The first genesis of conscious life is explained as
                    a particular moment in this process. In some spiritualistic systems an attempt
                    is made to combine the mechanical (causal) and teleological ideas under the
                    notion of logical development. Yet as a rule the teleological way of conceiving
                    the process predominates.</p>
                <p>(c) The systems which seek to combine the teleological and the mechanical view of
                    evolution are for the most part based on the monistic idea that the material and
                    the mental are two equally real aspects of one thing. It is clear that this
                    conception of reality provides a way of doing justice to both modes of looking
                    at evolution. In this manner the systems now spoken of are able to regard all
                    parts of evolution as identical in nature, being alike links in a chain of
                    purposeful effects.</p>
                <p>This way of regarding the world in its process of evolution will vary according
                    to the particular view of the one reality underlying material and mental
                    phenomena. Thus we may have a universalistic conception of evolution as the
                    two-sided activity of one undivided substance. This idea passes easily into a
                    pantheistic view of the worldprocess as determined by a divine reason which is
                    also the principle of necessity. In the second place, we may have an
                    individualistic conception of this two-sided process, according to which the
                    world arises out of the unceasing activity of an indefinite number of elements
                    endowed with motion and sensation, and so comprehending a mechanical and a
                    teleological factor. It has already been remarked, however, that this conception
                    may be combined with a strictly mechanical view of evolution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History of the Idea of Evolution.—</hi> The doctrine of
                    evolution in its finished and definite form is a modern product. It required for
                    its formation an amount of scientific knowledge which could only be very
                    gradually acquired. It is vain, therefore, to look for clearly defined and
                    systematic presentations of the idea among ancient writers. On the other hand,
                    nearly all systems of philosophy have discussed the problems underlying
                    evolution. Such questions as the origin of the cosmos as a whole, the production
                    of organic beings and of conscious minds, and the meaning of the observable
                    grades of creation, have from the dawn of speculation occupied men’s minds; and
                    the answers to these questions often imply a vague recognition of the idea of a
                    gradual evolution of things. Accordingly, in tracing the antecedents of the
                    modern philosophic doctrine we shall have to glance at most of the principal
                    systems of cosmology, ancient and modern. Yet since in these systems the two
                    inquiries into the <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fieri</hi>
                    of the world are rarely distinguished with any precision, it will be necessary
                    to indicate very briefly the general outlines of the system so far as they are
                    necessary for understanding their bearing on the problems of evolution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mythological Interpretation.—</hi> The problem of the origin of
                    the world was the first to engage man’s speculative activity. Nor was this line

                    first, as in the case of the child, the problem of the genesis of things was
                    conceived anthropomorphically: the question “How did the world arise Î” first
                    shaped itself to the human mind under the form “Who made the world Î” As long as
                    the problem was conceived in this simple manner there was, of course, no room
                    for the idea of a necessary self-conditioned evolution. Yet the first indistiuct
                    germ of such an idea appears to emerge in combination with that of creation in
                    some of the ancient systems of theogony. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cosmogony.)</hi> Thus, for example, in the myth of the ancient Parsees, the
                    gods Ormuz and Ahriman are said to evolve themselves out of a primordial matter.
                    It may be supposed that these crude fancies embody a dim recognition of the
                    physical forces and objects personified under the forms of deities, and a rude
                    attempt to account for their genesis as a natural process. These first
                    unscientific ideas of a genesis of the permanent objects of nature took as their
                    pattern the process of organic reproduction and development, and this, not only
                    because these objects were regarded as personalities, but also because this
                    particular mode of becoming would most impress these early observers. This same
                    way of looking at the origin of the material world is illustrated in the
                    Egyptian notion of a cosmic egg out of which issues the god (Phta) who creates
                    the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indian Philosophy.—</hi> Passing from mythology to speculation
                    properly so called, w e find in the early systems of philosophy of India
                    theories of emanation which approach in some respects the idea of evolution.
                    Brahma is conceived as the eternal self-existent being, which on its material
                    side unfolds itself to the world by gradually condensing itself to material
                    objects through the gradations of ether, fire, water, earth, and the elements.
                    At the same time this eternal being is conceived as the all-embracing worldsoul
                    from which emanates the hierarchy of individual souls. In the later system of
                    emanation of Sankhja there is a more marked approach to a materialistic doctrine
                    of evolution. If, we are told, we follow the chain of causes far enough back we
                    reach unlimited eternal creative nature or matter. Out of this “principal thing”

                    will return. Yet this primordial creative nature is endowed with volition with
                    regard to its own development. Its first emanation as plastic nature contains
                    the original soul or deity out of which all individual souls issue.</p>

                    Greek physical philosophers who distinctly set themselves to eliminate the idea
                    of divine interference with the world by representing its origin and changes as
                    a natural process. The early Ionian physicists, including Thales, Anaximander,
                    and Anaximenes, seek to explain the world as generated out of a primordial
                    matter which is at the same time the universal support of things. This substance
                    is endowed with a generative or transmutative force<note anchored="true"

                    virtue of which it passes into a succession of forms. They thus resemble modern
                    evolutionists, since they regard the world with its infinite variety of forms as
                    issuing from a simple mode of matter. More especially the cosmology of
                    Anaximander resembles the modern doctrine of evolution in its conception of the
                    indeterminate <hi rend="smallcaps">(to</hi><hi rend="italic">απfψοv)</hi> out of
                    which the particular forms of the cosmos are differentiated. Again, Anaximander
                    may be said to prepare the way for more modern conceptions of material evolution
                    by regarding his primordial substance as eternal, and by looking on all
                    generation as alternating with destruction, each step of the process being of
                    course simply a transformation of the indestructible substance. Once more, the
                    notion that this indeterminate body contains potentially in itself the
                    fundamental contraries—hot, cold, etc.,—by the excretion or evolution of which
                    definite substances were generated, is clearly a forecasting of that antithesis
                    of potentiality and actuality which from Aristotle downwards has been made the
                    basis of so many theories of development. In conclusion, it is noteworthy that
                    though resorting to utterly fanciful hypotheses respecting the order of the
                    development of the world, Anaximander agrees with modern evolutionists in
                    conceiving the heavenly bodies as arising out of an aggregation of diffused
                    matter, and in assigning to organic life an origin in the inorganic materials of
                    the primitive earth (pristine mud). The doctrine of Anaximenes, who unites the
                    conceptions of a determinate and indeterminate original substance adopted by
                    Thales and Anaximander in the hypothesis of a primordial and all generating air,
                    is a clear advance on these theories, inasmuch as it introduces the scientific
                    idea of condensation and rarefaction as the great generating or transforming
                    agencies. For the rest, his theory is chiefly important as emphasizing the vital
                    character of the original substance. The primordial air is conceived as
                    animated. Anaximenes seems to have inclined to a view of cosmic evolution as
                    throughout involving a quasi-spiritual factor. This idea of the air as the
                    original principle and source of life and intelligence is much more clearly
                    expressed by a later writer, Diogenes of Apollonia. Diogenes made this
                    conception of a vital and intelligent air the ground of a teleological view of
                    climatic and atmospheric phenomena. It is noteworthy that he sought to establish
                    the identity of organic and inorganic matter by help of the facts of vegetal and
                    animal nutrition. Diogenes distinctly taught that the world is of finite
                    duration, and will be renewed out of the primitive substance.</p>

                    a prominent place in a history of the idea of evolution. This writer distinctly
                    sides with the Ionian physicists, as against the Eleatics, by asserting the
                    reality of motion, change, and generation. He differs from the former, as Grote
                    observes, by regarding the problem of change rather as one of ontology than of
                    physics. Heraclitus conceives of the incessant process of flux in which all
                    things are involved as consisting of two sides or moments—generation and
                    decay—which are regarded as a confluence of opposite streams. In thus making
                    transition or change, viewed as the identity of existence and nonexistence the

                    fundamental ideas in Mr Darwin’s theory of evolution. According to Grote, it is
                    doubtful how far Heraclitus intended to supply by his idea of fire a physical,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Empedocles.—</hi> Empedocles took an important step in the
                    direction of modern conceptions of physical evolution by teaching that all
                    things arise, not by transformations of some primitive form of matter, but by
                    various combinations of a number of permanent elements. Further, by maintaining
                    that the elements are continually being combined and separated by the two forces
                    love and hatred, which appear to represent in a figurative way the physical
                    forces of attraction and repulsion, Empedocles may be said to have made a
                    considerable advance in the construction of the idea of evolution as a strictly
                    mechanical process. It may be observed, too, that the hypothesis of a primitive
                    compact mass <hi rend="italic">(sphcerus),</hi> in which love (attraction) is
                    supreme, has some curious points of similarity to, and contrast with, that
                    notion of a primitive nebulous matter with which the modern doctrine of cosmic
                    evolution usually sets out. Empedocles tries to explain the genesis of organic
                    beings, and, according to Lange, anticipates the idea of Mr Darwin that
                    adaptations abound, because it is their nature to perpetuate themselves. He
                    further recognizes a progress in the production of vegetable and animal forms,
                    though this part of his theory is essentially crude and unscientific. More
                    important in relation to the modern problems of evolution is his thoroughly
                    materialistic way of explaining the origin of sensation and knowledge by help of
                    his peculiar hypothesis of effluvia and pores. The supposition that sensation
                    thus rests on a material process of absorption from external bodies naturally
                    led up to the idea that plants and even inorganic substances are pre-cipient,
                    and so to an indistinct recognition of organic life as a scale of

                    simple. It is no doubt true that the chief aim of Anaxagoras was to explain not
                    so much the diversity as the orderly arrangement of individual things. Yet his
                    conception of the prima c aos involves at least the notion of an apparent

                    appear to lean rather to a monistic and purely materialistic than to a dualistic

                    taught by Leucippus and Democritus we have the basis of the modern mechanical
                    conceptions of cosmic evolution. Here the endless harmonious diversity of our
                    cosmos, as well as of other worlds supposed to co-exist with our own, is said to
                    arise through the various combination of indivisible material elements differing
                    in figure and magnitude only. The force which brings the atoms together in the
                    forms of objects is inherent in the elements, and all their motions are
                    necessary. The origin of things, which is also their substance, is thus laid in
                    the simplest and most homogeneous elements or principles. The real world thus
                    arising consists only of diverse combinations of atoms, having the properties of
                    magnitude, figure, weight, and hardness, all other qualities being relative only
                    to the sentient organism. The problem of the genesis of mind is practically
                    solved by identifying the soul, or vital principle, with heat or fire which
                    pervades in unequal proportions, not only man and animals, but plants and nature
                    as a whole, and through the agitation of which by incoming effluvia all

                    recognizing the upward direction of human history, and so as contrasting with
                    the prevailing view of this history as a gradual deterioration. Critias tells us
                    there was a time when the life of man was lawless <hi rend="italic"

                    be done overtly were still practised in secret, and at this stage a wise man
                    arose who sought to instil terror into the minds of the people, and so conceived
                    the Deity, who is made the more terrible by being localized in the region whence
                    proceed thunder and lightning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plato.—</hi> Plato needs to be referred to here only because of
                    the strongly marked opposition of his philosophy to the teaching of evolution.
                    It is true (as Zeller remarks) that Plato’s whole philosophy was directed less
                    to the explanation of becoming than to the consideration of being. So far,
                    however, as the highly mythical cosmology of the <hi rend="italic">Timoeus</hi>
                    may be taken as indicating Plato’s way of looking at the successive order of the
                    world, we see that it widely deviates from that of the evolutionist. Thus the
                    notion of the Demiurgus is distinctly contradictory of the idea of a natural
                    process of evolution. Again, the supposition that the world of particular things
                    is somehow determined by pre-existing universal ideas lends itself rather to a
                    theory of emanation as a descent from the more perfect to the less perfect than
                    to a doctrine of evolution. It became the basis of that doctrine of universal
                    essences or types which for ages interfered with a scientific explanation of
                    organic forms. Again Plato exactly reverses the order of evolution in his way of
                    looking at the scale of organic beings and souls, since he sets out with the
                    highest and most perfect, the divine cosmos, and passes downwards to man and the
                    lower animals viewed as successive degradations.</p>

                    the more to the less perfect according to the distance from the original
                    self-moving agency. Yet on the whole Aristotle leaus to a teleological theory of
                    evolution, which he interprets dualistually by means of certain metaphysical
                    distinctions. Thus even his idea of the relatiou of the divine activity to the
                    world shows, as Zeller and Lange remark, a tendency to a pantheistic notion of a
                    divine thought which gradually realizes itself in the process of becoming.
                    Aristotle’s distinction of form and matter, and his conception of becoming as a
                    transition from actuality to potentiality, provides a new ontological way of

                    seems, as Ueberweg observes, to have inclined to entertain the possibility of a
                    spontaneous generation in the case of the lowest organisms. Aristotle’s
                    teleological conception of organic evolution often approaches modern mechanical
                    conceptions. Thus he says that nature fashions organs in the order of their
                    necessity, the first being those essential to life. So, too, in his psychology
                    he speaks of the several degrees of mind as arising according to a progressive
                    necessity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Grote calle

                    his view of touch and taste, as the two fundamental and essential senses, he may
                    remind one of Mr Spencer’s doctrine. At the same time Aristotle precludes the
                    idea of a natural development of the mental series by the supposition that man
                    contains, over and above a natural finite soul inseparable from the body, a
                    substantial and eternal principle (νουs) which enters into the individual from
                    without. Aristotle’s brief suggestions respecting the origin of society and
                    governments in the <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> show a leaning to a
                    naturalistic interpretation of human history as a development conditioned by
                    growing necessities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Strato.—</hi> Of Aristotle’s immediate successors one deserves
                    to be noticed here, namely, Strato of Lampsacus, who developed his master’s
                    cosmology into a system of naturalism. Strato appears to reject Aristotle’s idea
                    of an original source of movement and life extraneous to the world in favour of
                    an immanent principle. All parts of matter have an inward plastic life whereby
                    they can fashion themselves to the best advantage, according to their
                    capability, though not with consciousness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Stoics.—</hi> In the cosmology of the Stoics we have the
                    germ of a monistic and pantheistic conception of evolution. All things are said
                    to be developed out of an original being, which is at once material (fire) and
                    spiritual (the Deity), and in turn they will dissolve back into this primordial
                    source. At the same time the world as a developed whole is regarded as an
                    organism which is permeated with the divine Spirit, and so we may say that the
                    world-process is a self-realization of the divine Being. The formative principle
                    or force of the world is said to contain the several rational germinal forms of
                    things. Individual things are supposed to arise out of the original being, as
                    animals and plants out of seeds. Individual souls are an efflux from the
                    all-compassing world-soul. The necessity in the world’s order is regarded by the
                    Stoics as identical with the divine reason, aud this idea is used as the basis
                    of a teleological and optimistic view of nature. Very curious, in relation to
                    modern evolutional ideas, is the Stoical doctrine that our world is but one of a
                    series of exactly identical ones, all of which are destined to be burnt up and
                    destroyed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Epicureans—Lucretius.—</hi> The Epicureans differed from
                    the Stoics by adopting a purely mechanical view of the world-process. Their
                    fundamental conception is that of Democritus; they seek to account for the
                    formation of the cosmos, with its order and regularity, by setting out with the
                    idea of an original (vertical) motion of the atoms, which somehow or other
                    results in movements towards and from one another. Our world is but one of an
                    infinite number of others, and all the harmonies and adaptations of the universe
                    are regarded as a special case of the infinite possibilities of mechanical
                    events. Lucretius regards the primitive atoms (first beginnings or first bodies)
                    as seeds out of which individual things are developed. All living and sentient
                    things are formed out of insentient atoms (e.y., worms spring out of dung). The
                    peculiarity of organic and sentient bodies is due to the minuteness and shape of
                    their particles, and to their special motions and combinations. So, too, mind
                    consists but of extremely fine particles of matter, and dissolves into air when
                    the body dies. Lucretius traces, in the fifth book of his poem, the progressive
                    genesis of vegetal and animal forms out of the mother-earth. He vaguely
                    anticipates the modern idea of the world as a survival of the fittest when he
                    says that many races may have lived aud died out, and that those which still
                    exist have been protected either by craft, courage, or speed. Lucretius touches
                    on the development of man out of a primitive, hardy, beast-like condition.
                    Pregnant hints are given respecting a natural development of language which has
                    its germs in sounds of quadrupeds and birds, of religious ideas out of dreams
                    and waking hallucinations, and of the art of music by help of the suggestion of
                    natural sounds. Lucretius thus recognizes the whole range of existence to which
                    the doctrine of evolution may be applied.</p>

                    of whom Plotinus is the most important, we have the worldprocess represented
                    after the example of Plato as a series of descending steps, each being less
                    perfect than its predecessors, since it is further removed from the first

                    not strictly speaking one of emanation, since there is no communication of the
                    divine essence to the created world; yet it resembles emanation inasmuch as the
                    genesis of the world is conceived as a necessary physical effect, and not as the
                    result of volition. In Proclus we find this conception of an emanation of the
                    world out of the Deity, or the absolute, made more exact, the process being
                    regarded as threefold—(1) persistence of cause in effect, (2) the departure of
                    effect from cause, and (3) the tendency of effect to revert to its cause.</p>

                    the origin and courso of the world seek to combine Christian ideas of the Deity
                    with doctrines of Greek philosophy. The common idea of the origin of things is
                    that of an absolute creation of matter and mind alike. The course of human
                    history is regarded by those writers who are most concerned to refute Judaism as
                    a progressive divine education. Among the Gnostics we meet with the hypothesis
                    of emanation, as, for example, in the curious cosmic theory of Valentinus.</p>

                    the schoolmen, we find no progress towards a more accurate and scientific view
                    of nature. The cosmology of this period consists for the most part of the
                    Aristotelian teleological view of nature combined with the Christian idea of the
                    Deity and His relation to the world. In certain writers, however, there appears
                    a more elaborate transformation of the doctrine of creation into a system of
                    emanation. According to John Scotus Erigena, the nothing out of which the world
                    is created is the divine esseuce. Creation is the act by which God passes
                    through the primordial causes, or universal ideas, into the region of particular
                    things <hi rend="italic">(processio),</hi> in order finally to return to himself
                    <hi rend="italic">(reversio).</hi> The transition from the universal to the
                    particular is of course conceived as a descent or degradation. A similar
                    doctrine of emanation is to be found in the writings of Bernhard of Chartres,
                    who conceives the process of the unfolding of the world as a movement in a
                    circle from the most general to the individual, and from this back to the most
                    general. This movement is said to go forth from God to the animated heaven,
                    stars, visible world, and man, which represent decreasing degrees of
                    coguition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arab Philosophers.—</hi> Elaborate doctrines of emanation,
                    largely based on Neo-Platonic ideas, are also propounded by some of the Arabic
                    philosophers, as by Alfarabi and Avicenna. The leading thought is that of a
                    descending series of intelligences, each emanating from its predecessor, and
                    having its appropriate region in the universe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jewish Philosophy.—</hi> In the Jewish speculations of the
                    Middle Ages may be found curious forms of the doctrine of emanations, uniting
                    the Biblical idea of creation with elements drawn from the Persians and the
                    Greeks. In the later and developed form of the Cabala, the origin of the world
                    is represented as a gradually descending emanation of the lower out of the
                    higher. Among the philosophic Jews, the Spanish Avicebron, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Fons</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitee,</hi> expounds a curious doctrine
                    of emanation. Here the divine will is viewed as an efflux from the divine
                    wisdom, as the intermediate link between God, the first substance and all
                    things, and as the fountain out of which all forms emanate. At the same time all
                    forms, including the higher intelligible ones, are said to have their existence
                    only in matter. Matter is the one universal substance, body and mind being
                    merely specifications of this. Thus Avicebron approaches, as M. Munk
                    observes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Later Scholastics.—</hi> Passing now to the later schoolmen, a
                    bare mention must be made of Thomas, who elaborately argues for the absolute
                    creation of the world out of nothing, and of Albertus Magnus, who reasons
                    against the Aristotelian idea of the past eternity of the world. More importance
                    attaches to Duns Scotus, who brings prominently forward the idea of a
                    progressive development in nature by means of a process of determination. The
                    original substance of the world is the <hi rend="italic">materia
                    primo-prima,</hi> which is the immediate creation of the Deity. This serves Duns
                    Scotus as the most universal basis of existence, all angels ιavmg material
                    bodies. This matter is differentiated into particular things (which are not
                    privations but perfections) through the addition of an individualizing principle
                    <hi rend="italic">(hoecceitas)</hi> to the universal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(quidditas).</hi> The whole world is represented by the figure of a tree, of
                    which the seeds and roots are the first indeterminate matter, the leaves the
                    accidents, the twigs and branches corruptible creatures, the blossoms the
                    rational soul, and the fruit pure spirits or angels. It is also described as a
                    bifurcation of two twigs, mental and bodily creation out of a common root. One
                    might almost say that Duns Scotus recognizes the principle of a gradual physical
                    evolution, only that he chooses to represent the mechanism by which the process
                    is brought about by means of quaint scholastic fictions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revival of Learning.—</hi> The period of the revival of
                    learning, which was also that of a renewed study of nature, is marked by a
                    considerable amount of speculation respecting the origin of the universe. In
                    some of these we see a return to Greek theories, though the influence of
                    physical discoveries, more especially those of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo,
                    is distinctly traceable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Telesio.—</hi> An example of a return to early Greek
                    speculation is to be met with in Bernardino Telesio. By this writer the world is
                    explained as a product of three principles,—dead matter, and two active forces,
                    heat and cold. Terrestrial things arise through a confluence of heat, which
                    issues from the heavens, and cold, which comes from the earth. Both principles
                    have sensibility, and thus all products of their collision are sentient, that
                    is, feel pleasure and pain. The superiority of animals to plants and metals in
                    the possession of special organs of sense is connected with the greater
                    complexity and heterogeneity of their structure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Giordano Bruno.—</hi> In the system of Giordano Bruno, who
                    sought to construct a philosophy of nature on the basis of new scientific ideas,
                    more particularly the doctrine of Copernicus, we find the outlines of a theory
                    of cosmic evolution conceived as an essentially vital process. Matter and form
                    are here identified, and the evolution of the world is presented as the
                    unfolding of the world-spirit to its perfect forms according to the plastic
                    substratum (matter) which is but one of its sides. This process of change is
                    conceived as a transformation, in appearance only, of the real unchanging
                    substance (matter and form). All parts of matter are capable of developing into
                    all forms; thus the materials of the table and chair may, under proper
                    circumstances, be developed to the life of the plant or of the animal. The
                    elementary parts of existence are the <hi rend="italic">minima,</hi> or monads,
                    which are at once material and mental. On their material side they are not
                    absolutely unextended, but spherical. Bruno looked on our solar system as but
                    one out of an infinite number of worlds. His theory of evolution is essentially
                    pantheistic, and he does not employ his hypothesis of monads in order to work
                    out a more mechanical conception.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Campanella.—</hi> A word must be given to one of Bruno’s
                    contemporary compatriots, namely Campanella, who gave poetic expression to that
                    system of universal vitalism which Bruno developed. He argues, from the

                    appears to derive the organic part of nature out of the so-called
                    “inorganic.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boehme.—</hi> Another writer of this transition period deserves
                    a passing reference here, namely, Jacob Boehme the mystic, who by his conception
                    of a process of inner diremption as the essential character of all mind, and so
                    of God, prepared the way for later German theories of the origin of the world as
                    the self-differentiation and self-externalization of the absolute spirit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hobbes and Gassendi.—</hi> The influence of an advancing study
                    of nature, which was stimulated if not guided by Bacon’s writings, is seen in
                    the more careful doctrines of materialism worked out almost simultaneously by
                    Hobbes and Gassendi. These theories, however, contain little that bears directly
                    on the hypothesis of a natural evolution of things. In the view of Hobbes, the
                    difficulty of the genesis of conscious minds is solved by saying that sensation
                    and thought are part of the reaction of the organism on external movement. Yet
                    Hobbes appears (as Clarke points out) to have vaguely felt the difficulty; and
                    in a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n794/mode/1up"

                    (chap. 25, sect. 5) he says that the universal existence of sensation in matter
                    cannot be disproved, though he shows that when there are no organic arrangements
                    the mental side of the movement <hi rend="italic">(phantasma)</hi> is
                    evanescent. The theory of the origin of society put forth by Hobbes, though
                    directly opposed in most respects to modern ideas of social evolution, deserves
                    mention here by reason of its enforcing that principle of struggle <hi
                    rend="italic">(bellum</hi><hi rend="italic">omnium contra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >omnes)</hi> which has played so conspicuous a part in recent doctrines of
                    evolution. Gassendi, with some deviations, follows Epicurus in his theory of the
                    formation of the world. The world consists of a finite number of atoms, which
                    have in their own nature a self-moving force or principle. These atoms, which

                <p><hi rend="italic">Descartes.</hi> —In the philosophy of Descartes we meet with a
                    dualism of mind and matter which does not easily lend itself to the conception
                    of evolution. His doctrine that consciousness is confined to man, the lower
                    animals being unconscious machines <hi rend="italic">(automata),</hi> excludes
                    all idea of a progressive development of mind. Yet Descartes, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia Philosophia,</hi> laid the foundation of the modern
                    mechanical conception of nature and of physical evolution. In the third part of
                    this work he inclines to a thoroughly natural hypothesis respecting the genesis
                    of the physical world, and adds in the fourth part that the same kind of
                    explanation might be applied to the nature and formation of plants and animals.
                    He is indeed careful to keep right with the orthodox doctrine of creation by
                    saying that he does not believe the world actually arose in this mechanical way
                    out of the three kinds of elements which he here supposes, but that he simply
                    puts out his hypothesis as a mode of conceiving how it might have arisen.
                    Descartes’s account of the mind and its passions is thoroughly materialistic,
                    and to this extent he works in the direction of a materialistic explanation of
                    the origin of mental life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spinoza.—</hi> In Spinoza’s pantheistic theory of the world,
                    which regards thought and extension as but two sides of one substance, the
                    problem of becoming is submerged in that of being. Although Spinoza’s theory
                    attributes a mental side to all physical events, he rejects all teleological
                    conceptions ami explains the order of things as the result of an inherent
                    necessity. He recognizes gradations of things according to the degree of
                    complexity of their movements and that of their conceptions. To Spinoza (as Kuno
                    Fischer observes) man differs from the rest of nature in the degree only and not
                    in the kind of his powers. So far Spinoza approaches the conception of
                    eVolution. He may be said to furnish a further contribution to a metaphysical
                    conception of evolution in his view of all finite individual things as the
                    infinite variety to which the unlimited productive power of the universal
                    substance gives birth. Mr F. Pollock has taken pains to show in more than one
                    essay how nearly Spinoza approaches certain ideas contained in the modern
                    doctrine of evolution, as for example that of self-preservation as the
                    determining force in things.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cudworth.—</hi> One or two English writers belonging to the
                    latter part of the 17th century must be glanced at here. Of these the first is
                    Cudworth, who, in his work <hi rend="italic">The True. Intellectual System of
                    the Universe,</hi> elaborately criticises the various “atheistic” modes of
                    explaining the origin and form of the world as a natural process. Cudworth
                    emphasizes especially the difficulty of explaining the rise of consciousness,
                    and seeks to show how the early Greek atomical physiologists were driven to
                    assume a spiritual principle over and above their material elements. He dwells
                    on the signs of purpose in nature, and argues that no fortuitous combination of
                    elements could have sufficed to produce that balance of male and female
                    individuals on which the preservation of species depends. Yet though thus an
                    anti-evolutionist, Cudworth provides a way of interpreting the evolution of life
                    by means of an immanent principle, since he refers the forms of nature to a
                    plastic principle, which does not involve consciousness, though it may be called
                    a drowsy unawakened cognition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Locke.—</hi> In Locke we find, with a retention ∩f certain
                    anti-evolutionist ideas, a marked tendency to this mode of viewing the world. To
                    Locke the universe is the result of a direct act of creation, even matter being
                    limited in duration and created. Even if matter were eternal it would, ho
                    thinks, be incapable of producing motion; and if motion is itself conceived as
                    eternal, thought can never begin to be. The first eternal being is thus
                    spiritual or “cogitative,” and contains in itself all the perfections that can
                    ever after exist. He repeatedly insists on the impossibility of senseless matter
                    putting on sense.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Yet he
                    leaves open the question whether the Deity has annexed thought to matter as a
                    faculty, or whether it rests on a distinct spiritual principle.</p></note> Yet
                    while thus placing himself at a point of view opposed to that of a gradual
                    evolution of the organic world, Locke prepared the way for this doctrine in more
                    ways than one. First of all, his genetic method as applied to the mind’s
                    ideas—which laid the foundations of English analytical psychology—was a step in
                    the direction of a conception of mental life as a gradual evolution. Again he
                    works towards the same end in his celebrated refutation of the scholastic theory
                    of real specific essences. In this argument he emphasizes the vagueness of the
                    boundaries which mark off organic species with a view to show that these do not
                    correspond to absolutely fixed divisions in the objective world, that they are
                    made by the mind, not by nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Locke half playfully touches on certain monsters, with

                    This idea of the continuity of species is developed more fully in a remarkable
                    passage <hi rend="italic">(Essay,</hi> bk. iii. ch vi. § 12), where he is
                    arguing in favour of the hypothesis, afterwards elaborated by Leibnitz, of a
                    graduated series of minds (species of spirits) from the Deity down to the lowest
                    animal intelligence. He here observes that “all quite down from us the descent
                    is by easy steps, and a continued series of things, that in each remove differ
                    very little from one another.” Thus man approaches the beasts, and the animal
                    kingdom is nearly joined with the vegetable, and so on down to the lowest and
                    “most inorganical parts of matter.” Finally, it is to be observed that Locke had
                    a singularly clear view of organic arrangements (which of course he explained
                    according to a theistic teleology) as an adaptation to the circumstances of the
                    environment or to “the neighbourhood of the bodies that surround us.” Thus he
                    suggests that man has not eyes of a microscopic delicacy, because he would
                    receive no great advantage from such acute organs, since though adding
                    indefinitely to his speculative knowledge of the physical world they would not

                    natural science was preparing the way for a doctrine of physical evolution, so
                    advancing historical research was leading to the application of a similar idea

                    >Century—Hume.—</hi> The theological discussions which make up so large a part
                    of the English speculation of the last century cannot detain us here. There is,
                    however, one writer who sets forth so clearly the alternative suppositions
                    respecting the origin of the world that he claims a brief notice. We refer to
                    David Hume, In his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues concerning Natural Pe-ligion</hi>
                    he puts forwards tentatively, in the person of one of his interlocutors, the
                    ancient hypothesis that since the world resembles an animal or vegetal organism
                    rather thau a machine, it might more easily be accounted for by a process of
                    generation than by an act of creation. Later on he develops the materialistic
                    view of Epicurus, only modifying it so far as to conceive of matter as finite.
                    Since a finite number of particles is only susceptible of finite transpositions,
                    it must happen (he says), in an eternal duration that every possible order or
                    position will be tried an infinite number of times, and hence this world is to
                    be regarded (as the Stoics maintained) as an exact reproduction of previous
                    worlds. The speaker seeks to make intelligible the appearance of art and
                    contrivance in the world as a result of a natural settlement of the universe
                    (which passes through a succession of chaotic conditions) into a stable
                    condition, having a constancy in its forms, yet without its several parts losing
                    their motion and fluctuation.</p>

                    Monboddo must be named on account of his curious speculations respecting the

                    Monboddo conceives man as gradually elevating himself from an animal condition,
                    in which his mind is immersed in matter, to a state in which mind acts
                    independently of body. In his equally voluminous work, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Origin and Progress of Language,</hi> Monboddo brings man under the same species
                    as the orang-outang. He traces the gradual elevation of man to the social state,
                    which he conceives as a natural process determined by “the necessities of human
                    life.” He looks on language (which is not “natural” to man in the sense of being
                    necessary to his self-preservation) as a consequence of his social state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French Writers of the 18th Century.—</hi> Let us now pass to
                    the French writers of the last century. Here we are first struck by the results
                    of advancing physical speculation in their bearing on the conception of the
                    world. Careful attempts, based on new scientific truths, are made to explain the
                    genesis of the world as a natural process. Maupertuis, who, together with λ
                    oltaire, introduced the new idea of the universe as based on Newton’s
                    discoveries, sought to account for the origin of organic things by the
                    hypothesis of sentient atoms. Buffon the naturalist speculated, not only on the
                    structure and genesis of organic beings, but also on the course of formation of
                    the earth and solar system, which he conceived after the analogy of the
                    development of organic beings out of seed. Diderot, too, in his varied
                    intellectual. activity, found time to speculate on the genesis of sensation and
                    thought out of a combination of matter endowed with an elementary kind of
                    sentience. De la Mettrie worked out a materialistic doctrine of the origin of
                    things, according to which sensation and consciousness are nothing but a
                    development out of matter. He sought <hi rend="italic">(L</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">homme-machines</hi> to connect man in his
                    original condition with the lower animals, and emphasized <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hhomme-plantd)</hi> the essential unity of plan of all living things.
                    Helvetius, in his work on man, referred all differences between our species and
                    the lower animals to certain peculiarities of organization, and so prepared the
                    way for a conception of human development out of lower forms as a process of
                    physical evolution. Charles Bonnet met the difficulty of the origin of conscious
                    beings much in the same way as Leibnitz, by the supposition of eternal minute
                    organic bodies to which are attached immortal souls. Yet though in this way
                    opposing himself to the method of the modern doctrine of evolution, he aided the
                    development of this doctrine by his view of the organic world as an ascending
                    scale from the simple to the complex. Robinet, in his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De la Nature,</hi> worked out the same conception of a gradation in organic
                    existence, connecting this with a general view of nature as a progress from the
                    lowest inorganic forms of matter up to man. The process is conceived as an
                    infinite series of variations or specifications of one primitive and common
                    type. Man is the <hi rend="italic">chef T oeuvre</hi> of nature, which the
                    gradual progression of beings was to have as its last term, and all lower
                    creations are regarded as pre-conditions of man’s existence, since nature “could
                    only realize the human form by combining in all imaginable ways each of the
                    traits which was to enter into it.” The formative force in this process of
                    evolution (or “metamorphosis”) is conceived as an intellectual principle <hi
                    rend="italic">(idee</hi><hi rend="italic">generatrice^.</hi> Robinet thus laid
                    the foundation of that view of the world as wholly vital, and as a progressive
                    unfolding of a spiritual formative principle, which was afterwards worked out by
                    Schelling. It is to be added that Robinet adopted a thorough-going materialistic
                    view of the dependence of mind on body, going even to the length of assigning
                    special nerve-fibres to the moral sense. The system of Holbach seeks to provide
                    a consistent materialistic view of the world and its processes. Mental
                    operations are identified with physical movements, the three conditions ot
                    physical movement, inertia, attraction, and repulsion, being in the moral world
                    self-love, love, and hate. He left open the question whether the capability of
                    sensation belongs to all matter, or is confined to the combinations of certain
                    materials. He looked on the actions of the individual organism and of society aβ
                    determined by the needs of selfpreservation. He conceived of man as a product of
                    nature that had gradually developed itself from a low condition, though he
                    relinquished the problem of the exact mode of his first genesis and advance as
                    not soluble by data of experience. Holbach thus worked out the basis of a
                    rigorously materialistic conception of evolution.</p>
                <p>The question of human development which Holbach touched on was one which occupied
                    many minds both in and out of France during the past century, and more
                    especially towards its close. The foundations of this theory of history as an
                    upward progress of man out of a barbaric and animal condition were laid by Vico
                    in his celebrated work <hi rend="italic">Principii</hi><hi rend="italic">di

                    Leibnitz is no doubt to account for the world in its static aspect as a
                    co-existent whole, to conceive the ultimate reality of things in such a way as

                    order of the world. He prepares the way, too, for a doctrine of evolution by his
                    monistic idea of the substantial similarity of all things, inorganic and
                    organic, bodily and spiritual, and still more by his conception of a perfect
                    gradation of existence from the lowest “inanimate” objects, whose essential
                    activity is confused representation, up to the highest organized being—man—with

                    now to Leibnitz’s conception of the world as a process, we see first that he

                    More than this, Leibnitz supposes that the activity of the monads takes the form
                    of a self-evolution. It is the following out of an inherent tendency or impulse
                    to a series of changes, all of which were virtually pre-existent, and this
                    process cannot be interfered with from without. As the individual monad, so the
                    whole system which makes up the world is a gradual development. In this case,
                    however, we cannot say that each step goes out of the other as in that of
                    individual development. Each monad is an original independent being, and is
                    determined to take this particular point in the universe, this place in the
                    scale of beings. We see how different this metaphysical conception is from that
                    scientific notion of cosmic evolution in which the lower stages are the
                    antecedents and conditions of the higher. It is probable that Leibnitz’s notion
                    of time and space, which approaches Kant’s theory, led him to attach but little
                    importance to the successive order of the world. Leibnitz, in fact, presents to
                    us an infinite system of perfectly distinct though parallel developments, which
                    on their mental side assume the aspect of a scale, not through any mutual
                    action, but solely through the determination of the Deity. Even this idea,
                    however, is incomplete, for Leibnitz fails to explain the physical aspect of
                    development. Thus he does not account for the fact that organic beings—which
                    have always existed as preformations (in the case of animals as <hi
                    rend="italic">animaux spermatiques)</hi> —come to be developed under given
                    conditions. Yet Leibnitz prepared the way for a new conception of organic
                    evolution. The modern monistic doctrine, that all material things consist of
                    sentient elements, and that consciousness arises through a combination of these,
                    was a natural transformation of Leibnitz’s theory.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">Kant.—</hi> Kant’s relation to the doctrine of evolution is a
                    many-sided one. In the first place, his peculiar system of subjective idealism,
                    involving the idea that time is but a mental form to which there corresponds
                    nothing in the sphere of noiimenal reality, serves to give a peculiar
                    philosophical interpretation to every doctrine of cosmic evolution. Kant, like
                    Leibnitz, seeks to reconcile the mechanical and teleological views of nature,
                    only he assigns to these different spheres. The order of the inorganic world is
                    explained by properly physical causes. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturgeschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">des Himmels,</hi> in which he anticipated
                    the nebular theory afterwards more fully developed by Laplace, Kant sought to
                    explain the genesis of the cosmos as a product of physical forces and laws. The
                    worlds, or systems of worlds, which fill infinite space are continually being
                    formed and destroyed. Chaos passes by a process of evolution into a cosmos, and
                    this again into chaos. So far as the evolution of the solar system is concerned,
                    Kant held these mechanical causes as adequate. For the world as a whole,
                    however, he postulated a beginning in time (whence his use of the word
                    creation), and further supposed that the impulse of organization which was
                    conveyed to chaotic matter by the Creator issued from a central point in the
                    infinite space-spreading gradually outwards.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Kant held it probable that other planets besides our earth
                    are inhabited, and that their inhabitants form a scale of beings, their
                    perfection increasing with the distance of the planet which they inhabit from
                    the sun.</p></note> While in his cosmology Kant thus relies on mechanical
                    conceptions, in his treatment of organic life his mind is, on the contrary,
                    dominated by teleological ideas. An organism was to him something controlled by
                    a formative organizing principle. It was natural, therefore, that he rejected
                    the idea of a spontaneous generation of organisms (which was just then being
                    advocated by his friend Forster), not only as unsupported by experience but as
                    an inadequate hypothesis. Experience forbids our excluding organic activity from
                    natural causes, also our excluding intelligence from purposeful <hi
                    rend="italic">(zu'eckthdtigeη)</hi> causes; hence experience forbids our
                    defining the fundamental force or first cause out of which living creatures
                    arose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kant calls the
                    doctrine of the transmutation of species “a hazardous fancy of the reason.” Yet,
                    as Strauss and others have shown, Kant’s mind betrayed a decided leaning at
                    times to a more mechanical conception of organic forms as related by
                    descent.</p></note> Just as Kant thus sharply marks off the regions of the
                    inorganic and the organic, so he sets man in strong opposition to the lower
                    animals. His ascription to man of a unique faculty, free-will, forbade his
                    conceiving our species as a link in a graduated series of organic developments.
                    In his doctrine of human development he does indeed recognize an early stage of
                    existence in which our species was dominated by sensuous enjoyment and instinct.
                    He further conceives of this stage as itself a process of (natural) development,
                    namely, of the natural disposition of the species to vary in the greatest
                    possible manner so as to preserve its unity through a process of selfadaptation
                    (A «arte«) to climate. This, he says, must not be conceived as resulting from
                    the action of external causes, but is due to a natural disposition <hi

                    involves a teleological idea) Kant distinguishes the power of moral
                    self-development or self-liberation from the dominion of nature, the gradual
                    realization of which constitutes human history or progress. This moral
                    development is regarded as a gradual approach to that rational, social, and
                    political state in which will be realized the greatest possible quantity of
                    liberty. Thus Kant, though he appropriated and gave new form to the idea of
                    human progress, conceived of this as wholly distinct from a natural (mechanical)
                    process. In this particular, as in his view of organic actions, Kant distinctly
                    opposed the idea of evolution as one universal process swaying alike the
                    physical and the moral world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Schelling.—</hi> In the earlier writings of Schelling,
                    containing the philosophy of identity, existence is represented as a becoming,
                    or process of evolution. Nature and mind (which are the two sides, or polar
                    directions, of the one absolute) are each viewed as an activity advancing by an
                    uninterrupted succession of stages. The side of this process which Schelling
                    worked out most completely is the negative side, that is, nature. Nature is
                    essentially a process of organic self-evolution. It can only be understood by
                    subordinating the mechanical conception to the vital, by conceiving the world as
                    one organism animated by a spiritual principle or intelligence <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Weltseele).</hi> From this point of view the processes of nature from the
                    inorganic up to the most complex of the organic become stages in the
                    self-realization of nature. All organic forms are at bottom but one
                    organization, and the inorganic world shows the same· formative activity in
                    various degrees or potences. Schelling conceives of the gradual self-evolution
                    of nature in a succession of higher and higher forms as brought about by a
                    limitation of her infinite productivity, showing itself in a series of points of
                    arrest. The detailed exhibition of the organizing activity of nature in the
                    several processes of the organic and inorganic world rests on a number of
                    fanciful and unscientific ideas. Schelling’s theory is a bold attempt to
                    revitalize nature in the light of growing physical and physiological science,
                    and by so doing to comprehend the unity of the world under the idea of one
                    principle of organic development. His highly figurative language might leave us
                    in doubt how far he conceived the higher stages of this evolution of nature as
                    following the lower in time. In the introduction to his work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Von der Weltseele,</hi> however, he argues in favour of the possibility of a
                    transmutation of species in periods incommensurable with ours. The evolution of
                    mind (the positive pole) proceeds by way of three stages,—theoretic, practical,
                    and aesthetical activity. Schelling’s later theosophic speculations do not
                    specially concern us here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Folloτvers of Schelling.—</hi> Of the followers of Schelling a
                    word or two must be said. Heinrich Steffens, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthropologie,</hi> seeks to trace out the origin and history of man in
                    connexion with a general theory of the development of the earth, and this again
                    as related to the formation of the solar system. All these processes are
                    regarded as a series of manifestations of a vital principle in higher and higher
                    forms. Oken, again, who carries Schelling’s ideas into the region of biological
                    science, seeks to reconstruct the gradual evolution of the material world out of
                    original matter, which is the first immediate appearance of God, or the
                    absolute. This process is an upward one, through the formation of the solar
                    system and of our earth with its inorganic bodies, up to the production of man.
                    The process is essentially a polar linear action, or differentiation from a
                    common centre. By means of this process the bodies of the solar system separate
                    themselves, and the order of cosmic evolution is repeated in that of terrestrial
                    evolution. The organic world (like the world as a whole) arises out of a
                    primitive chaos, namely, the infusorial slime. A somewhat similar working out of
                    Schelling’s idea is to be found in Oersted’s work entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Soul in Nature</hi> (Eng. trans.). Of later works based on Schelling’s doctrine
                    of evolution mention may be made of the volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Natur
                    und</hi><hi rend="italic">Idee,</hi> by G. F. Carus. According to this writer,
                    existence is nothing but a becoming, and matter is simply the momentary product
                    of the process of becoming, while force is this process constantly revealing
                    itself in these products.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hegel.—</hi> Like Schelling, Hegel conceives the problem of
                    existence as one of becoming. He differs from him with respect to the ultimate
                    motive of that process of gradual evolution which reveals itself alike in nature
                    and in mind. With Hegel the absolute is itself a dialectic process which
                    contains within itself a principle of progress from difference to difference and
                    from unity to unity. “This process (Mr Wallace remarks) knows nothing of the
                    distinctions between past and future, because it implies an eternal present.”
                    This conception of an immanent spontaneous evolution is applied alike both to
                    nature and to mind and history. Nature to Hegel is the idea in the form of
                    hetereity; and finding itself here it has to remove this exteriority in a
                    progressive evolution towards an existence for itself in life and mind. Nature
                    (says Zeller) is to Hegel a system of gradations, of which one arises
                    necessarily out of the other, and is the proximate truth of that out of which it
                    results. There are three stadia, or moments, in· this process of nature—(1) the
                    mechanical moment, or matter devoid of individuality; (2) the physical moment,
                    or matter which has particularized itself in bodies—the solar system; and (3)
                    the organic moment, or organic beings, beginning with the geological organism—or
                    the mineral kingdom, plants, and animals. Yet this process of development is not
                    to be conceived as if one stage is naturally produced out of the other, and not
                    even as if the one followed the other in time. Only spirit has a history; in
                    nature all forms are contemporaneous.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hegel somewhere says that the question of the eternal
                    duration of the world, is unanswerable: time as well as space can be predicated
                    of finitudes only.</p></note> Hegel’s interpretation of mind and history as a
                    process of evolution has more scientific interest than his conception of nature.
                    His theory of the development of free-will (the objective spirit), which takes
                    its start from Kant’s conception of history, with its three stages of legal
                    right, morality as determined by motive and instinctive goodness <hi
                    rend="italic">{Sittlichheic),</hi> might almost as well be expressed in terms of
                    a thoroughly naturalistic doctrine of human development. So, too, some of his
                    conceptions respecting the development of art and religion (the absolute spirit)
                    lend themselves to a similar interpretation. Yet while, in its application to
                    history, Hegel’s theory of evolution has points of resemblance with those
                    doctrines which seek to explain the world-process as one unbroken progress
                    occurring in time, it constitutes on the whole a theory apart and <hi
                    rend="italic">generis.</hi> It does not conceive of the organic as succeeding on
                    the inorganic, or of conscious life as conditioned in time by lower forms. In
                    this respect it resembles Leibnitz’s idea of the world as a development; the
                    idea of evolution is in each case a metaphysical as distinguished from a

                <p><hi rend="italic">Schopenhauer.—</hi> Of the other German philosophers
                    immediately following Kant, there is only one who calls for notice here, namely,
                    Arthur Schopenhauer. This writer, by his conception of the world as will which
                    objectifies itself in a series of gradations from the lowest manifestations of
                    matter up to conscious man, gives a slightly new shape to the evolutional view
                    of Schelling, though ha deprives this view of its optimistic character by
                    denying any co-operation of intelligence in the world-process. In truth,
                    Schopenhauer’s conception of the world as the activity of a blind force is at
                    bottom a materialistic and mechanical rather than a spiritualistic and
                    teleological theory. Moreover, Schopenhauer’s subjective idealism, and his view
                    of time as something illusory, hindered him from viewing this process as a
                    sequence of events in time. Thus he ascribes eternity of existence to species
                    under the form of the “Platonic ideas.” As Ludwig Noire observes,<note

                    Schopenhauer has no feeling for the problem of the origin of organic beings. He
                    says Lamarck’s original animal is something metaphysical, not physical, namely,
                    the will to live. “Every species (according to Schopenhauer) has of its own
                    will, and according to the circumstances under which it would live, determined
                    its form and organization, —yet not as something physical in time, but as
                    something metaphysical out of time.”</p>

                    first half of the century, a word must be said of Von Baer, who not only reached
                    those ideas of individual and serial development which are at the basis of the
                    modern doctrine of organic evolution, but who recognized in the law of this
                    development the law of the universe as a whole. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entwickelungsgeschichte der</hi><hi rend="italic">Thiere</hi> (p. 264) he
                    distinctly tells us that the law of growing individuality is “the fundamental
                    thought which goes through all forms and degrees of animal development and all
                    single relations. It is the same thought which collected in the cosmic space the
                    divided masses into spheres, and combined these to solar systems; the same which
                    caused the weather-beaten dust on the surface of our metallic planet to spring
                    forth into living forms.” Von Baer thus prepared the way for Mr Spencer’s
                    generalization of the law of organic evolution as the law of all evolution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Early Half of the Century—English Writers.—</hi> We may here
                    conveniently break off our review of German evolutionists, returning to the
                    writers of the latter part of the century presently. The thinkers outside
                    Germany who in the first half of the century contributed elements to the growth
                    of the idea of evolution are too unimportant to detain us here. In the English
                    philosophy of this period questions of cosmology play a very inconsiderable
                    part. The development of the analytical psychology, especially by the two Mills,
                    may be referred to. Also an allusion may be made to the discussions respecting
                    the nature of cause. Among these Sir W. Hamilton’s definition of cause <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lectures on Metaphysics,</hi> ii. 377) is specially interesting
                    as appearing to tell against the production of mind out of matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French Writers—Comte.—</hi> Tn France during this period the
                    name of Auguste Comte is the only one that need arrest our attention. Comte’s
                    principles of positivism, which restricted all inquiry to phenomena and their
                    laws, are said by his recent disciples to exclude all consideration of the
                    ultimate origin of the universe, as well as of organic life.</p>
                <p>Yet though Comte did not contribute to a theory of cosmic organic evolution, he
                    helped to lay the foundations of a scientific conception of human history as a
                    natural process of development determined by general laws of human nature
                    together with the accumulating influences of the past. Comte does not recognize
                    that this process is aided by any increase of innate capacity; on the contrary,
                    progress is to him the unfolding of fundamental faculties of human nature which
                    always pre-existed in a latent condition; yet he may perhaps be said to have
                    prepared the way for the new conception of human progress by his inclusion of
                    mental laws under biology.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italian Writers.—</hi> In Italy during this period there meet
                    us one or two thinkers who concern themselves with the interpretation of the
                    world-process. Ant. Rosmini follows Campanella in endowing chemical atoms with
                    sensibility and life, and he bases the hierarchy of beings in the universe on
                    the different degrees of this sensibility. At the same time he follows Bruno in
                    speaking of the totality of the world as an organism endowed with a soul which
                    individualizes itself in the innumerable existences of the universe. Spontaneous
                    generation is to Rosmini a necessary consequence of his theory of a universal
                    life. Other Italian writers adopt Hegel’s notion of the world as a
                    self-evolution of the idea. Of these it is enough to mention Terensio Mamiani,
                    who gives an optimistic turn to his conception of evolution by viewing it as a
                    progressive union of the finite with the infinite. Mamiani argues against
                    Darwin, and holds that all specific forms are fixed for all time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern Doctrine of Evolution.—</hi> We now approach the period
                    in which the modern doctrine of evolution in its narrow sense has originated.
                    This doctrine is essentially a product of scieutific research and speculation.
                    It is a necessary outcome of the rapid advance of the physical sciences. Its
                    final philosophic form cannot yet be said to be fixed. It may be defined as a
                    natural history of the cosmos including organic beings, expressed in physical
                    terms as a mechanical process. In this record the cosmic system appears as a
                    natural product of elementary matter and its laws. The various grades of life on
                    our planet are the natural consequences of certain physical processes involved
                    in the gradual transformations of the earth. Conscious life is viewed as
                    conditioned by physical (organic and more especially nervous) processes, and as
                    evolving itself in close correlation with organic evolution. Finally, human
                    development, as exhibited in historical and prehistorical records, is regarded
                    as the highest and most complex result of organic and physical evolution. This
                    modern doctrine of evolution is but an expansion and completion of those
                    physical theories which opened the history of speculation. It differs from them
                    in being grounded on exact and verified research. As such, moreover, it is a
                    much more limited theory of evolution than the ancient. It does not concern
                    itself (as yet at least) about the question of the infinitude of worlds in space
                    and in time. It is content to explain the origin and course of development of
                    the world, the solar or, at most, the sidereal system which falls under our own
                    observation. It would be difficult to say what branches of science had done most
                    towards the establishment of this doctrine. We must content ourselves by
                    referring to the progress of physical (including chemical) theory, which has led
                    to the great generalization of the conservation of energy; to the discovery of
                    the fundamental chemical identity of the matter of our planet and of other
                    celestial bodies, and of the chemical relations of organic and inorganic bodies;
                    to the advance of astronomical speculation respecting the origin of the solar
                    system, &amp;c.; to the growth of the new science of geology which has
                    necessitated the conception of vast and unimaginable periods of time in the past
                    history of our globe, and to the rapid march of <pb break="no"

                    all branches of historical study.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">English Writers—Darwin.—</hi> The honour of working out this
                    theory of evolution on a substanial basis of fact belongs to England. Of the
                    writers who have achieved this result Mr Darwin deserves the first notice.
                    Though modestly confining himself to the problem of accounting for the evolution
                    of the higher organic forms out of the lower, Mr Darwin has done much to further
                    the idea of a gradual evolution of the physical world. The philosophic
                    significance of the hypothesis of natural selection, especially associated with
                    Mr Darwin, is due, as Professor Helmholtz points out, to the fact that it
                    introduces a strictly mechanical conception in order to account for those
                    intricate arrangements known as organic adaptations which had before been
                    conceived only in a teleological manner. By viewing adaptations as conditions of
                    self-preservation, Mr Darwin is able to explain how it is that the seemingly
                    purposeful abounds in organic nature. In so doing he has done much to eliminate
                    the teleological method from biology. It is true that, in his conception of
                    seemingly spontaneous variations and of correlations of growth, he leaves room
                    for the old manner of viewing organic development as controlled by some internal
                    organizing principle. Yet his theory, as a whole, is clearly a heavy blow to the
                    teleological method. Again, Mr Darwin has greatly extended the scope of
                    mechanical interpretation, by making intelligible, apart from the co-operation
                    of intelligent purpose, the genesis of the organic world as a harmonious system
                    of distinct groups, a unity in variety, having certain well-marked typical
                    affinities. How greatly this arrangement has helped to support the idea of an
                    ideal plan, we have had occasion to observe. Mr Darwin in his doctrine of the
                    organic world as a survival refers this appearance of systematic plan to
                    perfectly natural causes, and in so doing lie gives new meaning to theancient
                    theory that the harmony of the world arises out of discord. Once more, Mr
                    Darwin’s hypothesis is of wide philosophic interest, since it helps to support
                    the idea of a perfect gradation in the progress of things. The variations which
                    he postulates are slight, if not infinitesimal, and only effect a sensible
                    functional or morphological change after they have been frequently repeated and
                    accumulated by heredity.</p>
                <p>Mr Darwin’s later work, in which he applies his theory of the origin of species
                    to man, is a valuable contribution to a naturalistic conception of human
                    development. The mind of man in its lowest stages of development is here brought
                    into close juxtaposition to the animal mind, and the upward progress of man is
                    viewed as effected by natural causes, chief among which is the action of natural
                    selection. Mr Darwin does not inquire into the exact way in which the mental and
                    the bodily are connected. He simply assumes that, just as the bodily organism is
                    capable of varying in an indefinite number of ways, so may the mental faculties
                    vary indefinitely in correspondence with certain physical changes. In this way
                    he seeks to account for all the higher mental powers, as the use of language and
                    reason, the sentiment of beauty, and conscience.</p>
                <p>Finally, Mr Darwin seeks to give a practical and ethical turn to his doctrine. He
                    appears to make the end of evolution the conscious end of man’s action, since he
                    defines the general good as “the rearing of the greatest number of individuals
                    in full health and vigour, and with all their faculties perfect under the
                    conditions to which they are subject. I urther, in his view of the future of the
                    race, - 1r Darwin leans to the idea that the natural process which has effected
                    man’s first progress must continue to be an important factor in evolution, and
                    that, consequently, it is not well to check the scope of this process by undue
                    restraints of population, and a charitable preservation of the incompetent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Λ. P. Wallace.—</hi> Mr A. R. Wallace, who shares with Mr
                    Darwin the honour of establishing the doctrine of natural selection, differs
                    from the. latter in setting much narrower limits to the action of this cause in
                    the mental as well as the physical domain. Thus he would mark off the human
                    faculty of making abstractions, such as space and time, as powers which could
                    not have been evolved in this way. Mr Wallace leans to the teleological idea of
                    some superior principle which has guided man in his upward path, as well as
                    controlled the whole process of organic evolution. This law is connected with
                    the absolute origin of life and organization.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Herbert Spencer.—</hi> The thinker who has done more than any
                    one else to elaborate a consistent philosophy of evolution on a scientific basis
                    is Mr Herbert Spencer. First of all he seeks to give greater precision to the
                    conception of this universal process. Evolution is a change from the homogeneous
                    to the heterogeneous, from the indefinite or undetermined to the definite or
                    determined, from the incoherent to the coherent. Again, Mr Spencer seeks to show
                    that the causes of evolution are involved in the ultimate laws of matter, force,
                    and motion, among which he gives great prominence to the modern doctrine of the
                    conservation of energy. Thus the rationale of the process shapes itself to Mr
                    Spencer as a distinctly mechanical problem. He sets out with the assumption of a
                    limited mass of homogeneous matter acted upon by incident forces, and seeks to
                    show how, by help of two laws,—namely, the instability of the homogeneous, and
                    the multiplication of the effects of any such incident force,—the process known
                    as evolution is brought about. This process is illustrated in the genesis of the
                    solar system,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The writer
                    suggests that the whole sidereal system may be the result of a similar
                    process.</p></note> for the explanation of which Mr Spencer makes use of the
                    nebular hypothesis, in the formation of our planet, as well as the development
                    of organic and mental life. Mr Spencer does not, however, conceive of this
                    process of evolution as unlimited in time. As in the development of the
                    individual organism, so in that of organic beings as a whole, of the earth, and
                    of the solar system, there is a conflict between the forces of which the action
                    is integrating or consolidating and those of which the action is disintegrating.
                    The process of evolution always tends to an equilibration between these
                    conflicting forces and ultimately to a dissolution of the products of evolution.
                    Thus the solar system is a moving equilibrium which is destined to be finally
                    dissipated into the attenuated matter out of which it arose. Mr Spencer thus
                    approaches the earliest theories of cosmic evolution when he tells us <hi
                    rend="italic">(First Principles,</hi> p. 482) that vast periods in which the
                    forces of attraction prevail over those of repulsion, alternate with other vast
                    periods in which the reverse relation holds. The mechanical theory of evolution
                    thus laid down in the <hi rend="italic">First Principles</hi> is applied in Mr
                    Spencer’s later works to the explanation of organic, mental, and social
                    evolution. The full explanation of the processes of inorganic evolution finds no
                    place in the writer’s system. Mr Spencer seeks, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles of Biology,</hi> to conceive of organic bodies and their actions in
                    mechanical terms. Life Is regarded as essentially a correspondence of internal
                    actions in the organism to external actions proceeding from the environment, and
                    the object of Mr Spencer’s volumes is to explain on mechanical principles the

                    consideration of the question how life first arose, though it is clear that he
                    regards the lowest forms of life as continuous in their essential nature with
                    sub-vital processes. It is in the later volumes, dealing with mental and social
                    evolution, that Mr Spencer’s exposition becomes most interesting to the student
                    of philosophy. In the <hi rend="italic">Principles of Psychology,</hi> he seeks
                    to deal wit <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> h mind as an aspect or correlate of
                    life which begins to manifest itself when the process of adjustment to
                    environment, in which all life consists, reaches a certain degree of complexity.
                    Mr Spencer indulges in no hypothesis respecting the universal co-existence of
                    sentience with matter and force. He thinks we must accept the distinctions which
                    common-sense has established, and so limit feeling or consciousness to organic
                    beings endowed with a nervous system. Thus, just as he does not seek to explain
                    the first appearance of life as a whole, so he does not seek to explain the
                    first dawn of mental life. Mr Spencer’s unit of consciousness is the blurred
                    undetermined feeling which answers to a single nervous pulsation or shock.
                    Assuming this he seeks to trace the gradual evolution of consciousness.
                    Sensations arise by a number of rapid successions of such elementary feelings
                    variously combined, and all more composite states of mind arise by a similar
                    process of combination of these feelings. Thus mental evolution is a progressive
                    composition of units of feeling in more and more complex forms, and united by
                    more complex relations. Mr Spencer’s conception of mind thus excludes all
                    fundamental distinctions of faculty. Instinct, memory, reason, the emotions and
                    volitions, alike develop themselves in divergent directions out of a common
                    elementary process. They are, moreover, all related to one and the same
                    biological process, being incidental accompaniments of the actions by which the
                    organism responds and adjusts itself to the forces of its environment. According
                    as these actions are more complex, and consequently less immediate, the mental
                    actions which accompany them vary in character from reflex action up to
                    deliberate volition, from the most simple presentative feeling or sensation up
                    to the most complex representative and re-representative feeling or emotion. It
                    would be impossible to point to all the applications which Mr Spencer has made
                    of his principle of evolution to the questions of psychology. We may just
                    mention among other points of interest his attempt to explain the innate
                    intuitions of space, moral right, &lt;fcc., as mental dispositions handed down
                    from progenitors and embodying the uniform experience of many generations, his
                    ingenious endeavour to account for the coincidence between pleasures and pains
                    and actions beneficial and injurious to the organism, and his conception of the
                    aesthetic interest as a growth out of the play-impulse, which is the tendency of
                    activities that have become developed beyond the immediate needs of existence to
                    vent themselves.</p>
                <p>Mr Spencer’s elaboration of the subject of social evolution has not been carried
                    far enough for us to understand the full bearing of his ideas. Yet the
                    fundamental conceptions are given us. The writer regards society, after the
                    analogy of an individual organism, as possessing a number of various structures
                    or organs and functions, and as tending to evolve itself by a series of
                    adjustments to its environment, physical and social. All ideas and institutions
                    display this process of evolution no less than societies as wholes. History is
                    to our author essentially the record of this social evolution. It is to be
                    observed that Mr Spencer attributes to society a certain spontaneous tendency to
                    evolution apart from natural selection. He looks on progress as a gradual
                    process of selfadaptation of man to the conditions of his environment, and
                    anticipates an age when this adjustment will be complete and human happiness
                    perfect. Tn this respect Mr Spencer’s conception of man’s history and destiny
                    wears an optimistic tinge when compared with that very vaguely shadowed forth by
                    Mr Darwin.</p>
                <p>To Mr Spencer, as to Mr Darwin, the doctrine of evolution seems to supply the end
                    of conduct. He conceives of morality as essentially an observance of the laws of
                    life, the individual and the collective. At the same time, since Mr Spencer
                    regards the moral sense as a growth out of feelings of pleasure and pain (racial
                    experiences), closely identifies the ends of life and happiness, and distinctly
                    teaches that social evolution or progress makes for an increase of happiness,
                    his ethical doctrine does not materially differ from that of utilitarianism.</p>
                <p>So far we have said nothing respecting the metaphysical basis which Mr Spencer
                    seeks to give to his doctrine of evolution. It is generally agreed that this
                    does not really belong to his doctrine of evolution itself. Mr Spencer is a
                    thorough-going realist. From his general scheme of evolution one would be
                    prepared to find him avowing himself a materalist. Yet he seeks to avoid this
                    conclusion by saying that it is one unknowable reality which manifests itself
                    alike in the material and in the mental domain. At the same time, this
                    unknowable is commonly spoken of as force, and in many places seems to be
                    identified with material force. Mr Spencer makes little use of his metaphysical
                    conception in accounting for the evolution of things. He tells us neither why
                    the unknowable should manifest itself in time at all, nor why it should appear
                    as a material world before it appears under the form of mind or consciousness.
                    Indeed Mr Spencer’s doctrine of evolution cannot be said to have received from
                    its author an adequate metaphysical interpretation. The idea of the unknowable
                    hardly suffices to give to his system an intelligible monistic basis. In truth,
                    this system seems in its essence to be dualistic rather than monistic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metaphysical Interpretation—Professor Cliford.—</hi> Of the
                    very few who have dealt with the metaphysical interpretation of the scientific
                    doctrine of evolution, Professor Clifford deserves special notice. In an essay
                    entitled “On things in themselves,” published in <hi rend="italic">Mind</hi>
                    (No. ix.), as well as in other and earlier papers, Mr Clifford, starting from
                    the basis of empirical idealism which asserts that material objects are nothing
                    but states of consciousness, argues that the reality answering to them is in all
                    cases something mental. Thus all existence—including what we call minds as well
                    as bodies—consists in aggregates of elementary “mind stuff,” the elements
                    themselves corresponding to Mr Spencer’s units of feeling. The writer expressly
                    argues that his idea of a continuity of mental existence throughout the physical
                    (phenomenal) world is the direct consequence of the doctrine of evolution. This
                    theory is curious as providing a monistic and quasi-spiritualistic conception of
                    evolution, which is at the same time a mechanical one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problems of Organic Evolution.—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >G.</hi><hi rend="italic">II. Lewes.—</hi> Among the writers who have worked on
                    the lines laid down by our two great evolutionists, a high place must be given
                    to Mr G. II. Lewes, who in his biological and psychological writings, and more
                    especially the <hi rend="italic">Problems of Life and Mind,</hi> adopts a view
                    of the relations of mind and life or organization closely resembling in its
                    essentials that of Mr Spencer. To Mr Lewes consciousness is but a more complex
                    form of mental life which is correlated with the actions of all the nervous
                    centres, its lowest form being sentience. He appears to look on mind in all its
                    grades as but the other side or face of the bodily processes which it
                    accompanies. Yet he has not so far made use of this monistic conception in
                    explaining the gradual evolution of conscious mental life. Indeed, though Mr
                    Lewes’s writings are pervaded with the idea of organic evolution, his
                    discussion<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"

                    volume, <hi rend="italic">The Physical Basis of Mind,</hi> might seem ever and
                    again, by its sharp separation of organic and inorganic (mechanical) processes,
                    to tell against the supposition of an evolution of life out of inorganic
                    matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">J. J. Murphy.—</hi> The question of the genesis of life and
                    mind receives a peculiar treatment in Mr J. J. Murphy’s <hi rend="italic">Habit
                    and Intelligence.</hi> In this work the teachings of the evolutionists are
                    largely accepted, while an attempt is made to reconcile these with a
                    teleological view of nature. The process of inorganic and of organic nature is
                    each recognized as one of evolution; but while the former is viewed as the
                    result of mechanical principles, the latter is said to imply an intelligent or
                    formative principle as well. Mechanical principles do indeed operate in
                    organisms, this is the region of habit; but over and above this, vital processes
                    involve a controlling intelligence. The author adopts the hypothesis that the
                    Creator endowed vitalized matter at the first with intelligence under the
                    guidance of which it organizes itself. Evolution is largely the result of this
                    vital intelligent principle, only a small part being attributable to mechanical
                    causes, such as natural selection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Evolution and Psychology.—</hi> The speculations of Mr Darwin
                    and Mr Spencer have had a powerful influence on recent English psychology, which
                    promises to become comparative, not only in the sense of including a comparison
                    of ethnological mental characteristics, but also in the wider sense of bringing
                    human intelligence into relation to that of the lower animals. Among writers who
                    have laboured in this construction of a theory of mental evolution, mention must
                    be made of the late Mr D. Spalding.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    remarkable essay <hi rend="italic">The Evolution of Self-Consciousness</hi>
                    (printed in a collection of his works), made a brilliant attempt to represent
                    man’s highest mental operations as evolved out of simple processes common to man
                    and the lower animals. The influence of evolutional ideas is further traceable
                    in the latest work of Mr A. Bain <hi rend="italic">{Emotions and Will,</hi> 3d
                    edition), and in the works of Dr Maudsley and other living psychologists. The
                    relation of the doctrine of evolution to psychology is handled in an essay by Mr
                    J. Sully <hi rend="italic">{Sensation and Intuition,</hi> ch. i.).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anthropology.—</hi> The application of the doctrine of
                    evolution to the question of man’s origin and development lias engaged the
                    attention of a number of writers. In a sense all recent anthropologists and
                    historians of culture may be said to have worked in this direction. Special
                    attention must, however, be called to those writers who have sought directly to
                    apply the fundamental ideas of evolution to these problems. Mr Bagehot’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Physics and Politics</hi> is remarkable as illustrating the
                    employment of the doctrine of natural selection in order to explain certain
                    aspects of political progress. Still more important is the contribution made by
                    Mr Fiske, in his <hi rend="italic">Cosmic Philosophy,</hi> to the theory of
                    man’s origin and development. Mr I iske’s work is a full exposition of Mr
                    Spencer’s doctrine of evolution. In addition to this it contains interesting
                    speculations respecting the steps by which man’s distinguishing intelligence and
                    sociality were first acquired and afterwards developed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relation to Ethics.—</hi> The application of the doctrine of
                    evolution to our ethical and religious ideas has engaged a number of writers. In
                    Mr A. Barratt’s <hi rend="italic">Physical Ethics</hi> the development of man’s
                    moral sense out of feelings of pleasure and pain is traced in connexion with his
                    organic and social evolution on which it is said to depend. By conceiving of all
                    matter as endowed with sensibility</p>
                <p>(pleasure and pain), Mr Barratt is able to connect man’s moral evolution with the
                    whole process of organic and of cosmic evolution. The idea of a natural growth
                    of the moral sense out of simpler impulses and instincts may also be frequently
                    fυuud in contemporary English literature. On the other hand, this consequence of
                    the evolution theory has been strenuously opposed in the interests of a
                    thoroughgoing intuitive ethics as, for example, by Mr St George Mivart, in his
                    work, <hi rend="italic">The Genesis of Species,</hi> and by Mi R. IL
                    Hutton.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays,</hi> vol. i. essay 3, “Science and Theism,” in which it is
                    said that “the Darwinian theory is quite incapable of explaining the
                    specifically human phenomenon of the rise of what may be called an
                    anti-Darwinian conscience, which restrains and subordinates tho principle of
                    competition.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Again the question has been discussed whether the doctrine of evolution
                    contributes towards the determination of the end or standard of morals. Mr
                    Sidgwick has shown that it cannot well do this merely by proving how the moral
                    sense has arisen. It is easy, however, to look upon the natural process as a
                    tendency towards an end, and to conceive of our conscious actions as being bound
                    by this tendency, so that the highest end of our existence must be to co-operate
                    with the natural forces. This idea pervades a good deal of contemporary
                    literature. It appears with special distinctness in the writings of Professor
                    Clifford<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially

                    the bearings of evolution on the ethical end, and reduces these to insignificant
                    proportions. This writer criticises Mr Darwin’s definition of the general good,
                    and argues that the idea of a mere quantity of life is inadequate to supply a
                    definite end of conduct Nevertheless life <hi rend="italic">{ζην)</hi> is the
                    prime condition of wellbeing (∈υ <hi rend="italic">ζηv),</hi> and so far the
                    evolutionist is right in making life a secondary aim. The differentia of
                    wellbeing, however, requires further interpretation, which can only be supplied
                    by the utilitarian principle. At the same time the doctrine of evolution guides
                    us in the pursuit of this ultimate end, in so far as increase of happiness
                    accompanies organic progress, or elevation in the scale of existence. Mr
                    Sidgwick further points out how little the doctrine of evolution assists the
                    utilitarian in dealing with social and political problems.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relation to Religion.—</hi> The bearing of the doctrine of
                    evolution on religion has formed the theme of a host of minor writings. On the
                    whole, Mr Darwin’s doctrine has been said (as it is by the author himself), not
                    only to be compatible with the idea of an original creation of the world, but to
                    supply a higher conception of the divine attributes than the hypothesis of
                    special creations; on the other hand, Mr Spencer’s doctrine, distinctly
                    excluding as it does the idea of creative activity, has called forth strong
                    opposition from a number of theological writers, among whom the most powerful is
                    certainly Professor Martineau.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    as the starting-point for a new quasi-religious conception of nature. The idea
                    of the cosmos and its forces as the author and source of our being easily lends
                    itself to a kind of pantheistic sentiment towards nature. In Mr Spencer’s own

                    part of the century offers us but little in the way of a discussion of the
                    problems with which evolution has to do. The activity of biological speculation
                    appears to have influenced but a few philosophic minds. Naturalistshave of
                    course discussed the doctrine of evolution, and one of these, E. Quinet, in his
                    work <hi rend="italic">La Creation,</hi> seeks to apply Mr Darwin’s theory to
                    problems of art and morality. Thus the ideal of art should, he thinks, be based
                    on the doctrine of evolution, and be “the presentment of superior forms which
                    slumber still in the bosom of actual things,” or the embodiment of “the possible
                    development of the human type in the progress of nature and man.” So the ideas
                    of duty and virtue are to be based on this doctrine. Mau is the only animal
                    which can retrograde, and evil is retrogression in the path laid down by nature.
                    It is an anachronism, or a revolt of man against himself. Among philosophic
                    writers proper, the first place must be given to M. Th. Ribot, who, in his
                    sympathetic exposition of Mr Spencer’s doctrine of evolution in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Recent English Psychology,</hi> and in his interesting
                    psychological study <hi rend="italic">On Heredity,</hi> shows himself to be
                    deeply pervaded with the new ideas, more especially in their bearing on mental
                    phenomena. M. Ribot regards mental evolution as depending on material, but adds
                    that the recognition of this connexion between the two domains of phenomena is
                    compatible with idealism no less than with materialism. He would eliminate the
                    conception of progress as a subjective one, and says that the idea of historical
                    progress must be taken up into that of an objective cosmic process. M. Ribot
                    makes many interesting applications of his law of mental heredity, which he
                    rightly regards as a factor in mental evolution; as, for example, when he speaks
                    of free-will as expressing the fixed personal factor in conduct,—namely, the
                    inherited character. Of other philosophic writers who have been affected by the
                    English doctrine of evolution, it is sufficient to name the late Léon Dumont,
                    who was one of the first in France to apply the ideas of Mr Darwin and Mr
                    Spencer to problems of psychology; and Professor A. Espinas, who in his work <hi
                    rend="italic">Des Sociétés Animales</hi> aims at furthering the theory of man’s
                    psychical derivation from lower types of mind. A writer who appears to be in a
                    lese distinct manner influenced by the idea of evolution is M. Taine, in whose
                    psychological and historical studies the indirect effect of a study of English
                    evolutionists is traceable. On the other hand, the older and teleological view
                    of the world has not wanted its defenders. The most signal supporter of this
                    direction, in the face of the doctrine of evolution, is M. Paul Janet, who, in
                    his earlier work <hi rend="italic">Le Matérialisme Contemporain,</hi> and still
                    more in his recent publication <hi rend="italic">Les Causes Finales,</hi> draws
                    a sharp line between the regions of the organic and the inorganic, and maintains
                    that the complex arrangements of the latter are only explicable by means of
                    teleological conceptions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Recent German Writers—Materialists.—</hi> In Germany the recent
                    progress of speculation, since the time of the great systems, has exhibited a
                    decided bent towards the problems which group themselves around the doctrine of
                    evolution. First of all the efforts of the materialists directly tended to the
                    formation of a consistent doctrine of cosmic evolution. Their earlier writings
                    appeared just before the epoch-making publication of Mr Darwin, but the ideas of
                    the latter have been incorporated in their later publications. In Moleschott’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Der Kreislauf des Lebens</hi> the whole order of things is
                    conceived as a continual flux and exchange of material elements, which accounts
                    for all pβychic life no less than for bodily life, and of which man, equally
                    with the lower animals, is a temporary product. L. Büchner has sought, in his
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Six Lectures on the
                    Darwinian Theory,</hi> to defend the new doctrine of organic evolution as a
                    necessary factor in the materialistic conception of the world. The latter work
                    connects Darwinism with the whole history of materialism. The former is a
                    somewhat feeble attempt to attach man’s ideal aims in the future to the
                    evolutionist’s conception of his past history. The writer appears to think that
                    something equivalent to the process of natural selection is to effect man’s
                    future progress, but the idea is not presented with any definiteness or
                    precision.</p>

                    Evolution.—</hi> After the materialists we come to a number of writers, who,
                    under the influence of advancing physical and physiological science, have sought
                    to construct a mechanical conception of the order of the world. Some of these
                    have contented themselves with sketching a natural history of the cosmos, others
                    have connected their mechanical conception with peculiar philosophical
                    ideas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Czolbe.—</hi> A curioue combination of the mechanical and
                    teleological conceptions of the world is to be met with in the system of Czolbe.
                    In his first works, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">neue Darstellung
                    des Sensualismus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Die Entstehung des
                    Selbst-Bewusstsein''s,</hi> Czolbe regards the world as a product of elementary
                    matter and organic forms both of which are eternal. According to this view,
                    sensation and consciousness are products of particular combinations of movements
                    (circular). To these two original principles he adds, later on, feelings and
                    sensations themselves, which exist in a latent state throughout space, and form
                    a kind of world-soul. Still later, he finds the substantial support of atoms and
                    sensations alike in space, in which feelings are located no lees than the
                    material elements. To Czolbe our visible world, together with conscious minds,
                    is thus a mosaic formed out of these elements, which group themselves according
                    to mechanical laws in bodies and conscious minds. He thus adopts a theory of
                    natural evolution which evades the difficulty of explaining the organic as a
                    product of the inorganic, and mind as a product of matter. But he only achieves
                    this by assuming the eternity cf all organic forms, and by conceiving of the
                    elementary sensations as themselves spatial or “extensional.” Though the
                    mechanical view of the world-order is most prominent in Czolbe, he combines with
                    this a teleological and optimistic view, according to which all things make for
                    the greatest possible perfection of conditioned happiness in every sentient
                    creature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">G. T. Fechner.—</hi> Another writer who combines the mechanical
                    view of the world with a curious metaphysical system is G. T. Fechner. Passing
                    by his earlier works, in which he develops his idea of the world as a gradation
                    of souls (including those of plants, an earth spirit, &lt;fcc.), we may best
                    turn to his later work <hi rend="italic">Einige Ideen zur</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    takes a thoroughly mechanical view of the difference between organic and
                    inorganic matter. But by help of this very difference he seeks to prove that the
                    latter is a product of the former, and not conversely. The great law which
                    determines the evolution of the world is the tendency to greater and greater
                    stability, which law at once supplies a mechanical and a teleological conception
                    of the universe. Organic bodies differ from inorganic in that their molecules
                    are in a less stable condition than those of the latter. Hence we must suppose
                    that the original source of the <pb break="no"

                    primitive “cosmorganic” condition of our earth. This primitive matter has
                    gradually differentiated itself into the regions of the organic and the
                    inorganic, and the former again into the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
                    Consciousness was breathed into the cosmorganic matter by the Creator and so
                    pressed out, as though from the bellows of an organ, into all living creatures.
                    This process of evolution is directed towards an end, namely, the greatest
                    possible degree of mutual adaptation of parts, or the most stable condition; and
                    conscious action is but the subjective side of this tendency.<note

                    world, as wrought out by modern science, is fully recognized and yet surmounted
                    in the cosmological doctrine put forth by Hermann Lotze in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mikrokosmus.</hi> Lotze defends the mechanical method as applicable to all
                    departments of phenomena, and insists on this way of viewing organic processes.
                    At the same time he holds that the mechanical interpretation of nature is
                    limited at every point. The inadequacy of this view may be seen in the attempt
                    to apply it to the question of the genesis of the world and its order. On the
                    one hand, Lotze accepts the teachings of modern speculation respecting the
                    evolution of the solar system, the genesis of the organic out of the inorganic,
                    the continuity of man with the lower animal world; and his exposition and
                    defence of this idea of evolution as the result of mechanical laws is extremely
                    able and interesting. Again, Lotze seeks to bridge over the gulf between
                    material and spiritual evolution by bringing human development into close
                    relation to the processes of nature as a whole. Yet, while thus doing justice to
                    the mechanical conception of the gradual genesis of the world, Lotze strenuously
                    affirms the limitations of this kind of explanation. In the first place, he
                    maintains that the mechanical processes themselves cannot be understood except
                    by help of ideas respecting the real internal nature of the elements cencerned.
                    This nature he describes as life, and thus he endows all parts of matter with
                    feeling (though he distinctly rejects Czolbe’s idea of a world-soul which
                    includes these feelings). In this internal activity Lotze finds a teleological
                    element, viz., a striving towards self-preservation and development. This idea
                    he seeks to blend with that of mechanical relations among the elements, so as to
                    make the whole upward process of physical evolution the product of purposeful
                    impulses. Thus the first genesis of organisms is represented as a combination of
                    elements (accidentally meeting), through which there is effected a summation of
                    the separate ends of the elements, to a purposeful equilibrium of a composite
                    whole.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lotze does not
                    express himself very clearly with respect to the question of the first genesis
                    of mind. In the <hi rend="italic">Mikrokosmus</hi> (ii. p. 33) he appears to
                    find the “sparks” of mental life in the atoms which he here conceives of after
                    the manner of Leibnitz’s monads. In another place, however <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Medizinische Psychologie,</hi> pp. 164, 165), Lo1ze tells us that mind is the
                    direct product of the original creative activity, which is stimulated to create
                    by the stimulus involved in the formation ol the physical germ.</p></note> This
                    may be called the first stage of his teleology. In addition to this, Lotze looks
                    at the world-process as a gradual unfolding of a creative spiritual principle,
                    which he sometimes figuratively describes as the world-soul, more commonly,
                    however, as the infinite substance. This assumption, he says, is necessitated by
                    the very process of cosmic evolution, the absolute beginning and end of which we
                    are wholly unable to conjecture. However far back the evolutionist may go he
                    always has to assume some definite arrangement of parts,—some general laws of
                    action of which he can give no account. The conception of the atomists, that in
                    the beginning of things there was an indefinite number of possibilities, is
                    unthinkable, and the modern doctrine of evolution, by conceiving of the existing
                    world as a survival of certain forms from among many others actually produced,
                    but lacking in the conditions of stability, plainly makes no such absurd
                    supposition. Hence, there must always be a certain order to be accounted for,
                    and science is wholly inadequate to effect this explanation. This conducts to a
                    teleological view of the world-process, as directed by mind towards some end
                    which we cannot distinctly recognize. Lotze’s criticisms of previous attempts to
                    formulate the end of the world-process are not the least valuable part of his
                    discussion of the problems of evolution. He shows that neither the notion of a
                    progressive effort towards the highest unfolding of mental life, nor that of an
                    impulse towards the greatest variety of manifestations of one and the same
                    fundamental form, adequately represents the order of organic forms. Here Lotze
                    shows again a due recognition of the mechanical aspect of the world-process, and
                    argues that the evolution of the organic world is no immediate consequence of
                    the self-evolving ideas, but only the form in which the commands of these ideas
                    are capable of being realized on our earth,—that is to say, with our terrestrial
                    conditions. A somewhat similar view of cosmic and organic evolution, -as at once
                    a mechanical and a teleological process, is to be found in Ulrici’s <hi

                    against these attempts to carry up a mechanical conception of evolution into a
                    teleological must be set a number of works which content themselves, in the
                    spirit of positive science, with expounding a doctrine of evolution on a
                    strictly mechanical basis. Of these we may first mention C. Radenhausen (Isis),
                    who, in his interesting work <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mensch</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">die Welt,</hi> expounds
                    the idea of a gradual evolution of the solar system, the earth, and organic
                    life. In the growth of the individual man the past evolution of the world is
                    represented. A temperate statement of the doctrine of modern evolution is to be
                    found in Dr Ch. Wiener’s volume <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Grundzuge der Weltordnung.</hi> The problems of the origin of organic life and

                    this may be compared another interesting presentation of the doctrine of
                    evolution,—namely, H. J. Klein’s <hi rend="italic">Entwickelungsgeschichte des

                    against Czolbe’s hypothesis of the past eternity of organic life. Organisms
                    first arose under some quite special physical conditions. A very curious feature
                    in this volume is the criticism of Mr Darwin’s doctrine of descent, which is
                    said to involve mystical ideas, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lange.—</hi> Among later works touching on the problems of
                    evolution the <hi rend="italic">History of Materialism</hi> of Lange deserves
                    mention here. Lange accepts the modern hypothesis of evolution, and justifies
                    the mechanical conception of its various stages. It is true that in his
                    criticism of Mr Darwin’s theory he assumes some internal formative principle (as
                    held to by Nägeli and Kölliker) as supplementary to the factor of utility
                    emphasized by Mr Darwin. Yet he does not appear to regard this process as other
                    than a mode of mechanical action. Lange’s greatest difficulty in view of a
                    consistent materialistic doctrine of evolution is to explain the genesis of
                    conscious life. The difficulty of the atomistic theory, even when we add a
                    rudimentary sensibility to the elements, is to determine “where and how the
                    transition is effected from the manifoldness of the collisions of the atoms to
                    the unity of sensation.” Lange supplements his mechanical view of the world by
                    the Kantian conception of the adaptation of the world by reason of its
                    generalities or uniformities to <pb break="no"

                    seeking to frame a theory of physical evolution we must always assume, over and
                    above the eternal atoms, a special initial arrangement of these, without which
                    the order of events would be inconceivable. This modest kind of teleology (he
                    says) is not only not opposed to Mr Darwin’s doctrine; it is its necessary
                    pre-supposition. “The formal purposefulness of the world is nothing else than
                    its adaptation to our understanding.” Lange seems further disposed to accept
                    Kant’s theory of organism as manifesting objective purpose, though he will not
                    allow that this explains anything, all explanations being by way of the
                    principle of mechanical causation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Noire.—</hi> In Ludwig Noiré we have a writer who accepts all
                    the teaching of scientific evolutionists, and at the same time seeks to give to
                    the doctrine a metaphysical and monistic interpretation. In his two volumes <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Welt als Entwickelung des Geistes</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Der Monistische Gedanke,</hi> Noiré assumes the existence
                    of elementary atoms or “monads” endowed with the twofold properties of motion
                    and sensation. Time and space are not simply forme of intuition, but forms of
                    appearance <hi rend="italic">{Erscheinungsformen')</hi> of these fundamental
                    properties. The process of evolution from the simple to the complex, has its
                    ground in the latter property, sensation, which gives its direction to motion
                    (which latter is unchangeable in amount), and which involves a tendency or
                    impulse to further differentiation. The purposefulness of the process of
                    evolution is due to its being the work of a mental principle (sensation). The
                    formation of inorganic bodies is the preliminary step in the process, and
                    involves an obscure mode of consciousness. The genesis of consciousness is said
                    to be effected by means of a certain mode of collision among the atoms, though
                    this point is not made very clear. Noiré’s doctrine of evolution appears to
                    waver somewhat between a mechanical theory (atoms endowed with sensibility, but
                    acting according to strictly mechanical laws) and a distinctly spiritualistic
                    and teleological doctrine, such a3 that of Schelling and Hartmann.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hartmann.—</hi> The writings of E. von Hartmann have a special
                    interest, as illustrating how Mr Darwin’s doctrine of organic development is
                    regarded from the point of view of a thorough-going metaphysical teleology. To
                    Hartmann the world is a manifestation in time—which is real as applying to the
                    activities of this principle—of an ontological principle, styled the
                    unconscious, which is at once will and intelligence. The process of evolution,
                    from the simplest material operations up to conscious human actions, depends on
                    the progressive domination of will, which is the blind force, and answers to the
                    mechanical aspect of the world, by intelligence, which gives to this force form
                    and direction, and answers to the logical and teleological aspect of the world.
                    The end of the process for which this unconscious makes is not, as Hegel says,
                    self-consciousness, but nonexistence, to which consciousness is the immediate
                    precondition. Hartmann has devoted a separate volume to Mr Darwin’s theory <hi

                    principle of natural selection as the mechanical means which the unconscious
                    makes use of in order to effect a certιin amount of the upward organic progress

                    sketch of the recent German discussion of evolution-problems, and so our
                    historical review as a whole, by a brief reference to the philosophic and
                    quasi-philosophic literature which has sprung up in Germany under the direct
                    influence of Mr Darwin’s doctrine. It is not a little curious that, of the two
                    great English evolutionists, the one who has most stimulated German
                    philosophical thought is the writer who has confined himself to questions of
                    natural science, while the writer who has built up the idea of organic descent
                    into a complete cosmological theory is only now beginning to be known in that
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">{a) Darwinism, and Methodology.—</hi> First of all, then, a
                    bare allusion must be made to certain criticisms of Mr Darwin’s biological
                    hypothesis as legitimate instruments of a sound natural philosophy. It may
                    surprise some English readers to learn that the doctrine of the descent of
                    species by natural selection has been denounced in Germany as partaking of the
                    vices of a spurious and teleological natural philosophy. The writer who has
                    taken most pains to show up the philosophic unsoundness of Mr Darwin’s procedure
                    is A. Wigand <hi rend="italic">{Der Darwinismus und die Naturforschung</hi><hi

                    influences of Darwinism· on German thought, we may best begin with the more
                    circumscribed branches of speculation. Physical speculation in Germany is being
                    slowly affected by Mr Darwin’s theory. A curious example of this is to be met
                    with in a little work by Dr Karl du Prel, entitled <hi rend="italic">Der Kampf
                    ums Dasein am Himmel.</hi> This work is of real philosophic interest as
                    illustrating how Mr Darwin’s way of conceiving self-preservation, as the effect
                    of natural superiority in respect of adaptability to the conditions of
                    existence, may be extended beyond the organic world to the cosmos as a whole. Du
                    Prel regards the cosmic bodies as analogous to competing organisms, space
                    standing for the means of existence for which they struggle, and the force of
                    attraction and the fitness of the body’s movement in relation to those of other
                    bodies representing organic efficiency. Those bodies which have these advantages
                    survive, whereas those which lack them are extinguished either by being
                    dissipated or fused with other bodies.</p>

                    speculations respecting the ultimate origin of living forms to which Darwinism
                    has given rise, we pass to those aspects of anthropology which have a peculiar
                    philosophic interest. In a sense it may be said that Mr Darwin’s speculations,
                    especially as carried out by himself in his <hi rend="italic">Descent of
                    Man,</hi> have powerfully influenced the whole of recent anthropological
                    speculation; for writers like A. Bastian <hi rend="italic">{Schöpfung und

                    science of man’s genesis and development, none has more of philosophic interest
                    than the question of the origin of language. This question, which lies at the
                    very threshold of a proper understanding of the relation of man’s mental nature
                    to that of the lower animals, is touched on by Mr Darwin himself in his <hi

                    of evolution, as defined by Mr Darwin, to the explanation of language, may be

                <p><hi rend="italic">(√) Darwinism and Psychology.—</hi> From anthropology we pass
                    to psychology. Here the influence of Darwinism meets us too. Among recent
                    psychologists W. Wundt, in his <hi rend="italic">Grundzüge der physiologischen
                    Psychologie,</hi> makes frequent use of the doctrine of a gradual evolution of
                    mental dispositions by means of heredity. He would, for example, explain the
                    rapidity with which the space perception is formed in the infant mind by help of
                    such an inherited disposition. Wundt appears to lean to the hypothesis of
                    ultimate sentient elements, by the summation of whose rudimentary feelings
                    arises the unity of consciousness.</p>
                <p>The wider consequences of Mr Darwin’s theory in the domain of psychology are
                    briefly indicated by Dr Georg von Giz’ycki, in his little work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">philosophischen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Con-sequenzeη</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lamarck-Darwin’</hi><hi rend="italic">sehen Entwicklungstheorie.</hi> He argues
                    against attributing sensation to all material things, which supposition (unlike
                    Professor Clifford) he does not regard as a necessary consequence of the
                    evolution hypothesis. He distinctly seizes the bearing of this doctrine on our
                    conception of mind (animal as well as human) as identical in its fundamental
                    laws, and as presenting to the psychologist a single serial development; and he
                    still further follows Mr Spencer in connecting all mental activity with vital
                    functions essential to the preservation of the individual and of the race.
                    Finally, he adopts the view that the mental organism depends on the laws of the
                    external universe. The harmony or adaptation which we see holding between
                    thoughts and things must be interpreted as the effect of the latter acting on
                    and modifying the former in conformity with themselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Darwinism and Ethics and Religion.—</hi> Passing now to the
                    region of practical philosophy, we find that Darwinism has occasioned in
                    Germany, as in England, a good deal of curious speculation. Among the many
                    writers who have touched on the aspects of Darwinism we cau only refer to one or
                    two. Among these we may mention Dr Paul Rée, who, in a recent work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Ursprung der moralischen Empfindungen,</hi> argues that moral
                    dispositions or altruistic impulses have been developed as useful to society,
                    yet rather oddly combines with this idea the pessimistic doctrine that man is
                    not on the whole growing more moral. Again Dr Giz’ycki, in the work just
                    referred to, emphasizes the bearing of the doctrine of human descent on our
                    feeling towards the lower animals as closely linked to ourselves. He goes on to
                    show that this doctrine involves the most definite and stringent form of
                    determinism, and so has a bearing on our ideas of right and wrong, blame,
                    &amp;c. The writer thinks Darwinism by no means excludes a teleological
                    conception of the world as a process striving towards the highest manifestation
                    of mental life, and this idea leading back to that of an absolute first cause of
                    the order of the world, becomes the starting-point for religious and aesthetic
                    aspiration. In Dr G. Jager’s work, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Darwin’sehe Theorie und ihre Stellung zu Moral und Religion,</hi> we find a
                    practical deduction from Darwinism which curiously contrasts with that of Dr
                    Giz’ycki. Jäger argues that this doctrine teaches us to place ourselves in the
                    greatest possible opposition to the lower animals. The aim of morality, as
                    taught by Darwinism, must be to develop to the utmost those excellences which
                    mark off man from the brute. The author seeks to account for the genesis of
                    social institutions and religious ideas, as utilities which benefited those
                    communities possessing them in the struggle for existence.</p>
                <p>A work in which are traced the ethical and religious consequences of the doctrine
                    of evolution is <hi rend="italic">The Old Faith and the Λew</hi> of David
                    Strauss. According to Strauss, all morality has its root in the recognition and
                    realization of the idea of kind in ourselves and in others. He argues from the
                    fact that nature has produced man as her last and highest achievement, and the
                    lower forms of creatures but as steps in the progress towards man, that our end
                    and aim must be the furtherance of that which marks us off from the brutes.
                    Religion again begins with the sense of unity « ith. nature, and the new
                    doctrine of the cosmos enables us to regard nature as the source whence our
                    life, as all life, springs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Interpretation of Modern Scientific Doctrine.—</hi> A word or
                    two, in conclusion, respecting what is known as the modern doctrine of
                    evolution. It is important to emphasize the fact that this is a scientific
                    doctrine, which has been built up by help of positive research. As such, of
                    course, it embodies the mechanical, as distinguished from the teleological, view
                    of nature’s processes. Yet it still awaits its final philosophic interpretation.
                    We cannot yet say under what head of our historical scheme it is destined to
                    fall.</p>
                <p>We think the question of the universal applicability of the doctrine to·physical
                    and mental phenomena may be allowed. There are no doubt wide gaps in our
                    knowledge of both orders. Thus it may reasonably be doubted whether physical
                    theory can as yet enable us fully to see the necessity of that universal process
                    from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous in which evolution consists; yet in a
                    rough and vague way the process is being made theoretically intelligible. Again,
                    the transition from the inorganic to the organic is, as Professor Tyndall has
                    lately told us, far from being conceivable in the present state of our
                    knowledge; and this seems to be implied in the remarkable hypothesis by which
                    Professor Helmholtz and Sir W. Thomson seek to account for the first appearance
                    of life on our planet. Yet we may reason from the general tendencies of research
                    that this step may some day be hypothetically explained in physical and
                    mechanical tenus. Again, in spite of Mr Spencer’s brilliant demonstration of the
                    general continuity of mental life, much remains to be done before all the steps
                    in the process <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> from particular to general
                    knowledge, from single feelings to self-consciousness) are made plain.
                    Nevertheless, we may even now dimly see how such mental processes may be knit
                    together in one larger process.</p>
                <p>Allowing, then, that the doctnne of evolution as a scientific hypothesis is
                    probably true, the question arises, what is its exact philosophical purport? How
                    far does it help to unify our knowledge, and is it the final explanation of the
                    complex events of our world?</p>
                <p>First of all, then, as a unifying generalization, it is clearly limited by the
                    fact of the correlation of mental aτιd physical evolution. These two regions of
                    phenomena may be seen to manifest the same law, yet they cannot be identified.
                    All the laws of physical evolution can never help us to understand the first
                    genesis of mind; and this difficulty is in no way reduced by Mr Spencer’s
                    conception of a perfect gradation from purely physical to conscious life. The
                    dawn of the first confused and shapeless feeling is as much a “mystery” as the
                    genesis of a distinct sensation. Our best exponents of evolution, including
                    Professor Du Bois Reymond <hi rend="italic">(fieber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >die</hi><hi rend="italic">Grenzen des Naturerkennens,</hi> p. 25 $?.), fully
                    recognize this difficulty. We have here much the same “mystery” which meets us
                    in the conversion of a nerve-stir4ulus into a sensation in the developed
                    organism. The sequence 13 unlike any properly physical succession, and so cannot
                    be further explained by being brought under a more general law. Not only so, the
                    doctrine of the conservation of energy, as applied to organic processes, leads
                    to the conclusion that the genesis of mind in general and of every single mental
                    phenomenon is, from a physical point of view, something non-essential.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0806-0771"/>
                <p>We may, no doubt, avoid this difficulty, in appearance at least, by assuming that
                    all material processes down to the vibrations of the indivisible atoms are
                    accompanied with a mode of feeling. This may, of course, be proposed as a
                    properly scientific hypothesis, and as involving no metaphysical assumptions
                    respecting the nature of atoms. The great difficulty here would be, how we are
                    to conceive of modes of sensibility that do not enter into a collective
                    consciousness, and which appear to lack all the characteristics of our own
                    conscious life.</p>
                <p>Even, however, if this huge difficulty of the genesis of mind is got over, there
                    still remain limits to the explanation effected by the doctrine of evolution.
                    Thus, while it might be able to deduce all the processes of physical evolution
                    from a few assumptions respecting primitive matter and its laws, it would have
                    no such data for resolving all these steps in the mental process which result in
                    a heterogeneous mode of feeling. How, for instance, is it to account on general
                    principles, and by <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> reasoning, for the
                    differentiation of a vague tactual sensibility into what we know as sight and
                    hearing—sensibilities which underlie all our ordinary conceptions of the
                    physical world? Here are manifestly set rigid limits to the explanation effected
                    by the doctrine of evolution, the limits which J. S. Mill has laid down as those
                    of all kinds of explanation of phenomena. The doctrine by no means helps us to
                    resolve all laws of succession into one.</p>
                <p>The other limits set to the explanatory power of the modern doctrine have already
                    been hinted at. Thus the doctrine sets out from a given point in time, at which
                    it assumes a definite arrangement of material (and mental) elements to have
                    obtained. “Of the beginning of the universe,” says Professor Clifford, “we know
                    nothing at all.” Again, Professor J. Clerk Maxwell tells us<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Discourse on
                    Molecules·</hi> See also the very interesting section on the “Nature and Origin
                    of Molecules,” which concludes the work on the <hi rend="italic">Theory of
                    Heιιt.</hi></p></note> that we must from the first assume an infinite number of
                    molecules exactly alike in their weight and rate of vibration; and he distinctly
                    argues against the supposition that this system of like elements can have been
                    evolved. There is room then for the question, how this particular order of
                    elements arose. And even if we go further back, and make with Mr Spencer the
                    large assumption that these various classée of molecules have been evolved from
                    perfectly homogeneous first elements, one may still ask for an explanation of
                    this original homogeneity. In short, it is plain that every doctrine of
                    evolution must assume some definite initial arrangement, which is supposed to
                    contain the possibilities of the order which we find to be evolved, and no other
                    possibility.</p>
                <p>Such being the limits set to the scope of explanation by the idea of evolution,
                    the question arises whether these apparently permanent gaps in our scientific
                    knowledge can be filled up by extra-scientific speculations. One may seek to
                    show the need of such a metaphysical interpretation of evolution by a reference
                    to the very nature of the doctrine. As a scientific truth, it is simply the
                    highest generalization respecting the order of phenomena in time, and as such
                    makes no assumptions with regard to the ultimate nature of that matter, force,
                    and mind, of which it speaks. What, it may be asked, are the realities
                    corresponding to these terms, and how are we to conceive of their mutual
                    relations <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> Each of the supposed deficiencies in the
                    doctrine of evolution just referred to leads us back to those various
                    metaphysical doctrines in which, as we have seen, the idea of evolution has
                    usually clothed itself. In order to understand what Mr Martineau calls the
                    whence as distinguished from the when, and to provide a substantial support for
                    the thread of phenomenal events, it would seem as if we must fall back on some
                    ultimate philosophic assumption respecting the efficient principle in the
                    process.</p>
                <p>With respect to metaphysical dualism, it must be said that it leaves us pretty
                    much where we were. The correlation of two distinct substances and their
                    manifestations, in the way required by the doctrine of evolution (whether this
                    correlation be universal or not), needs explanation as much as the correlation
                    of the two sets of phenomena. On the other hand, materialism, spiritualism, and
                    the so-called monism, have each their merits and their drawbacks as helps to the
                    interpretation of evolution. If materialism recommends itself by assuming the
                    fewest possible principles, it is exposed to the objection that it bids us
                    conceive a reality which is wholly distinct from mind. Further, it fails to give
                    any intelligible account of the rise and progress of mental activity. Again,
                    spiritualism assists us in accounting for the genesis of mind, and for the
                    appearance of intelligent order in the world. Yet it is questionable whether
                    this doctrine, assuming as it does some form of unconscious mind (whether as
                    world-soul or as elements of feeling), is not beset with as many difficulties as
                    it resolves. Further, it may be doubted whether the spiritualistic idea, in its
                    common pantheistic form, has yet succeeded in rendering intelligible the fixed
                    mechanical order which marks all stages of evolution. Finally, it may be allowed
                    that the monistic doctrine of one reality with two faces does in appearance lift
                    us over the difficulties which beset the materialistic and the spiritualistic
                    interpretation of evolution. Only is it in truth anything more than a verbal
                    simplification, and does it not rather leave us confined in that dualism where
                    science has to land us <hi rend="italic">1</hi></p>
                <p>It would thus seem that the doctrine of evolution has by no means as yet received
                    its final philosophic character. No one of the metaphysical doctrines which are
                    at our command is so plainly and completely adapted to transform it into a final
                    doctrine of existence, that it must of necessity be accepted at once and by
                    all.</p>
                <p>To this we must now add that to many minds this resort to a metaphysical
                    principle as the support of the process .of evolution will not be held to be
                    necessary. A positivist, who thinks that our knowledge of the universe must for
                    ever be limited to phenomena, is at perfect liberty to accept the doctrine of
                    evolution and to regard it as an ultimate expression for the order of the world.
                    Nay more, the empirical idealist—who may perhaps be defined as a positivist that
                    has fully analysed his “phenomena ”—can accept and give a meaning to the
                    doctrine of evolution as formulating the order of sensations, actual and
                    possible, of conscious minds. Mr Spencer somewhere says that, if idealism is
                    true, evolution is a dream. Yet this assertion may be reasonably disputed. It
                    may perhaps seem staggering to be told that evolution postulates vast periods of
                    time in which there existed no mind to experience the sensations into which the
                    world is on the idealistic hypothesis resolved. Yet this difficulty is only
                    apparent, since past physical evolution stands for a projection, so to speak, of
                    now existing minds, and for an order of sensations conceived as possible under
                    other and imaginable circumstances.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may be added that the hypothesis of the uniform
                    correlation of the physical and the mental enables us to assign an element of
                    actuality (mental life) to the remote periods here spoken of.</p></note> To the
                    empirical idealist physical evolution stands for an imagined order of
                    perceptions in an indefinite number of minds, mental evolution for actual
                    successions of feeling in many minds, and the transition from the one to the
                    other means the succession of actual states of consciousness on possible or
                    imagined states. The unity of the world-process arises from the ability of the
                    individual mind, which now reflects <pb break="no"

                    series of acts of imagination into a collective ideal experience for itself.</p>
                <p>Thus the doctrine of evolution seems to be susceptible of statement in terms of
                    idealism as easily as in terms of realism. In truth, each mode of viewing the
                    process is at once possible and beset with difficulties. The difficulty of
                    giving an idealistic interpretation arises from the popular distinction of mind
                    or perception and something beyond and independent of this. The difficulties of
                    giving a realistic interpretation have in part been stated already in speaking
                    of the different realistic interpretations (materialism and spiritualism). To
                    these must be now added the fundamental obstacle to all realism, which shows
                    itself, in a specially striking way, in relation to the doctrine of evolution,—
                    namely, the difficulty of conceiving in terms of human consciousness something
                    which is independent of, antecedent to, and creative of, this consciousness.</p>
                <p>It may be asked, perhaps, whether the doctrine of evolution, by providing a new
                    conception of the genesis of our cognitions, has anything to say to the question
                    of a real independent object. What the doctrine effects with respect to such
                    cognitions as those of space is to show that the bare fact of intuitiveness or
                    innateness does not establish their non-empirical or transcendental origin.
                    Similarly it may be held that the doctrine opens a way of accounting for the
                    growth of the idea of independent realities, supposing this to be now an innate
                    disposition of the mind—viz., by regarding this idea as arising in a succession
                    of many generations, if not out of, yet by help of, certain elements or aspects
                    of experience. It may, however, be maintained that the idea is not even
                    suggested by experience; if so, it would follow from the evolution theory that
                    its present persistence represents a permanent mental disposition to think in a
                    particular way. Even then, however, the question would remain open whether the
                    permanent disposition were an illusory or trustworthy tendency, and in deciding
                    this point the doctrine of evolution appears to offer us no assistance.<note

                    relations of this doctrine to realism, see the essay already referred to in Mr

                <p>As a scientific doctrine, whatever its ultimate interpretation, evolution has a
                    bearing on our practical, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> moral and religious
                    ideas. This has already been shown in part by writers from whom we have quoted.
                    Among other results, this doctrine may be said to give new form to the
                    determinist theory of volition, and to establish the relativity of all moral
                    ideas as connected with particular stages of social development. It cannot, as
                    Mr Sidgwick has shown, provide a standard or end of conduct except to those who
                    are already disposed to accept the law <hi rend="italic">sequi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">naturam</hi> as the ultimate rule of life. To such it furnishes an
                    end, though it would still remain to show how the end said to be unconsciously
                    realized by nature, the well-being of individuals and of communities, is to be
                    adjusted to the ends recognized in common-sense morality, including the
                    happiness of all sentient beings. It may be added that the doctrine, by
                    assigning so great an importance to the laws of inheritance as means of raising
                    the degree of organization and life, may be expected to exert an influence on
                    our ideas of the solidarity of the present generation and posterity, and to add
                    a certain solemnity to all the duties of life, prudential morality included.</p>
                <p>The bearing of the doctrine of evolution on religious ideas is not so easy to
                    define. Mr Spencer considers the ideas of evolution and of a pre-existing mind
                    incapable of being united in thought (see his rejoinder to Dr Martineau, <hi
                    rend="italic">Contemporary Review,</hi> vol· XX. p. 141 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqf</hi> Yet, according to others, the idea is by no means incompatible with
                    the notion of an original Creator, though it serves undoubtedly to remove the
                    action of such a being further from our ken. At first sight it might appear that
                    the doctrine as applied to the subjective world, by removing the broad
                    distinction between the human and the animal mind, would discourage the hope of
                    a future life for man’s soul. Yet it may be found, after all, that it leaves the
                    question very much where it was. It may perhaps be said that it favours the old
                    disposition to attribute immortality to those lower forms of mind with which the
                    human mind is found to be continuous. Yet there is nothing inconsistent in the
                    supposition that a certain stage of mental development qualifies a mind for
                    immortality, even though this stage has been reached by a very gradual process
                    of development. And if, as might be shown, the modern doctrine of evolution is
                    susceptible of being translated into terms of Leibnitz’s hypothesis of
                    indestructible monads, which include all grades of souls, then it is clearly not
                    contradictory of the idea of immortality.</p>
                <p>Very interesting is the bearing of the doctrine of evolution on that
                    aesthetico-religious sentiment towards the world which has taken the place of
                    older religious emotions in so many minds. First of all by destroying the old
                    anthropocentric view of nature, according to which she is distinct from and
                    subordinated to man, this doctrine favours that pantheistic sentiment which
                    reposes on a sense of ultimate identity between ourselves and the external
                    world. In a sense it may be said that the new doctrine helps to restore the
                    ancient sentiment towards nature as our parent, the source of our life. It is
                    well to add, however, that the theory of evolution, by regarding man as the last
                    and highest product of nature, easily lends support to the idea that all things
                    exist and have existed for the sake of our race. This seems, indeed, to be an
                    essential element in any conception we can form of a rationally evolved
                    universe.</p>
                <p>A reference must be made, in closing this article, to the optimistic aspect of
                    the doctrine of evolution. That there is a tone of optimism in much of the more
                    popular exposition of the doctrine of evolution needs not be proved. There is no
                    doubt, too, that both in Mr Darwin’s and Mr Spencer’s theories there are ideas
                    which tend to support a cheerful and contented view of things. The idea of the
                    survival of the fittest, and of evolution as a gradual process of adaptation to
                    environment, lend themselves to this kind of thought. Indeed, Du Bois Reymond,
                    in the lecture on Leibnitz already referred to, seriously argues that the
                    doctrine of evolution provides a scientific equivalent to that philosopher’s
                    remarkable conception of the best of all possible worlds. On the other hand, as
                    the present writer has elsewhere show n, Mr Darwin’s doctrine of evolution
                    contains elements which are fitted to tone dow n our estimate of the value of
                    the world viewed as the seat of conscious sentient life. The pain involved in
                    the renewed struggle for existence is a large drawback from the gains of human
                    progress and of organic development as a whole. More than this, the principle of
                    natural selection appears almost to favour a pessimist view of the world, in so
                    far as it implies the tendency of organic forms to multiply down to the limits
                    of bare existence.</p>
