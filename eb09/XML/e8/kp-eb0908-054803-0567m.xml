                    whose life is remarkable for the variety of its incidents. His father was
                    colonel of the Bourbon regiment, and it was while the army was on the march that
                    the boy was born, on the highway near Almen-dralejo in Estremadura. On the close
                    of the war, his parents settled at Madrid, and he thus had the opportunity of
                    becoming a pupil of Alberto Lιsta, the professor of literature in St Matthew’s
                    college. Before he was out of his fourteenth year, he had not only attracted his
                    master’s attention by his political poems, but had joined a conspiracy against
                    the minister Calomardi. During the imprisonment and seclusion at Guadalajara
                    which this offence brought upon him, he soothed his solitude by singing the fate
                    of Pelayo, the patron of Spanish liberty. On his release he withdrew to Lisbon,
                    only to find himself again imprisoned in the castle of St George, and to be
                    transported with some of his fellow refugees to England. Here, by one of those
                    turns of fortune which make truth stranger than fiction, he met with a young
                    lady with whom he had fallen in love while in Lisbon; and here too he became,
                    what was perhaps of as much importance for his poetic development, a student of
                    Shakespeare, Milton, and Byron, In 1830 he took part in the July revolution at
                    Paris, and soon after joined the ill-fated expedition of Pablo de Chapalangarra
                    in Spain. On the death of Ferdinand, he was not only allowed to return to his
                    native country, but obtained an appointment in the queen’s guards. This,
                    however, he soon forfeited by a political song, and he was banished to Cuellar,
                    where he had leisure to compose a novel in six volumes, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Sancho Saldana o el Castellano de Cuellar.</hi> The publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">estatuto real</hi> brought him back to Madrid to write and act
                    with as little caution as ever. He joined the revolutionary movements of 1835
                    and 1836, and in 1840 entered the national guard as lieutenant. The republican
                    party having come into power in 1840, he was appointed ambassador to the Hague,
                    but was obliged to give up his post through an illness which terminated fatally
                    at Madrid on the 23d of May 1842. His poetical works were collected by Villalta
                    in 1840, and have been reprinted more than once under the editorship of
                    Hartzenbusch. The “Student of Salamanca,” <hi rend="italic">El estucliante de
                    Salamanca,</hi> is a continuation of the legend of Don Juan, and <hi
                    rend="italic">El Diablo Mundo</hi> is based on the story of Faust. Of the lyric
                    poems, which are frequently distinguished by great force of expression and skill
                    in versification, the most remarkable are <hi rend="italic">El Mendigo</hi> or
                    the Beggar, <hi rend="italic">El Verdugo</hi> or the Headsman, the Hymn to the
                    Sun, and the Ode to Night. (See Ch. de Mazada, <hi rend="italic">Études
