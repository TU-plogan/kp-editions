                    rend="italic">spαrtιιm,</hi> whence the designation <hi rend="italic">campus
                    sptartarius</hi> for the region surrounding New Carthage. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cartagena,</hi> vol. v. p. 140.) It attains a height of three
                    or four feet. The stems are cylindrical, and clothed with short hair, and grow
                    in clusters of from two to ten feet in circumference; when young they serve as
                    food for cattle, but after a few years’ growth acquire great toughness cf
                    texture. The leaves vary from six inches to three feet in length, and are
                    greygreen in colour; on account of their tenacity of fibre and flexibility they
                    have for centuries been employed for the making of ropes, sandals, baskets,
                    mats, and other articles. Ships’ cables of esparto, being light, have the
                    quality of floating on water, and have long been in use in the Spanish navy.
                    Esparto leaves contain 56 per cent, by weight of fibre, or about 10 per cent,
                    more than straw, and hence have come largely into requisition as a substitute
                    for linen rags in the manufacture of paper. For this purpose they were first
                    utilized by the French, and in 1857 were introduced into Great Britain. In 1877
                    the total imports of esparto into the United Kingdom were 174,720 tons, being
                    43,809 tons in excess of the quantity imported in the previous year. When
                    required for paper-making the leaves should be gathered before they are quite
                    matured; if, however, they are obtained too young, they furnish a paper having
                    an objectionable semi-transparent appearance. The leaves are gathered by hand,
                    and from two to three hundredweight may be collected in a day by a single
                    labourer. They are generally obtained during the dry summer months, as at other
                    times their adherence to the stems is so firm as often to cause the uprooting of
                    the plants in the attempt to remove them. Esparto may be raised from seed, but
                    cannot be harvested for twelve or fifteen years after sowing. The increased
                    demands of the paper trade have led to forced cropping in some districts, where
                    in consequence there has been a falling off of from 2 to 10 per cent in
                    production. For the processes of the paper manufacturer esparto is used in the
                    dry state, and without cutting; roots and flowers and stray weeds are first
                    removed, and the material is then boiled with caustic soda, washed, and bleached
                    with chlorine solution. Sundry experiments have been made to adapt esparto for
                    use in the coarser textile fabrics. Messrs A. Edger _ and B. Proctor (seo <hi
                    rend="italic">Chem. News,</hi> vol. xxxv. p. 141, 1877) have directed attention
                    to the composition of the slag resulting from the burning of esparto, which they
                    find to be strikingly similar to that of average medical bottle glass, the
                    latter yielding on analysis 66 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 per cent, of
                    silica and 25 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> l per cent, of ιdkalies and
                    alkaline earths, and the slag C4∙C and 27 ’ 45 per cent, of the same
                    respectively. For further details concerning the manufacture of paper from
