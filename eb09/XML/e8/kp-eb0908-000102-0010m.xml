                <p><label type="entry">ELEATIC SCHOOL</label>, a Greek school of philosophy, so
                    called because Elea was the birth-place or residence of its chief
                    representatives. Parmenides, who was born at Elea probably about the year 515,
                    was the first completely to develop the Eleatic doctrines; but his philosophy
                    has a very close connection with that of Xenophanes, who was born more than a
                    century earlier. Xenophanes, indeed, has been described as the founder of the
                    school, and though that title is with more strictness to be given to Parmenides,
                    it may not incorrectly be applied to him. The philosophy of Xenophanes took its
                    rise in a strong antagonism to the popular anthropomorphic mythology; and,
                    though it contains part, it is far from containing the whole, of the Eleatic
                    doctrine as maintained by Parmenides and his followers. Its chief doctrines were
                    that “the One is God,” and that God is self-existent, eternal, unchangeable,
                    immovable, of the same substance throughout, and in every respect incomparable
                    to man.</p>
                <p>The Eleatic philosophy is founded upon the doctrine of a complete severance and
                    opposition of thought and sense. Truth is in no degree attainable by sense;
                    sense gives only false appearances, non-being: it is by thought alone that we
                    arrive at the knowledge of being, at the great truth that “the All is One,”
                    eternal, unchangeable; or rather, as Hegel rightly interprets the Eleatics,
                    thought is being. No distinction is drawn by Parmenides between thought and
                    material being; the “One and All,” indeed, is described materially as a perfect
                    and immovable sphere. The notions of creation, change and destruction, diversity
                    and multiplicity, time and space, and the various sensations, are all mere false
                    appearances of sense, which thought shows to be contradictory and false. Upon a
                    very common confusion of the word exist with the verb to be, which does not
                    necessarily imply existence, he founded his argument against the possibility of
                    creation: creation cannot be, for being cannot arise out of non-being; nor can
                    non-being be. Again, there can be no difference or change except in appearance,
                    for a thing cannot arise from what is different from it. But this side of the
                    Eleatic argument was more completely developed by Zeno. In the second part of
                    his poem, Parmenides, notwithstanding his assertion of their falseness, does
                    offer an explanation of the facts of consciousness. Of this part of his theory,
                    however, we have only very incomplete knowledge. It stands altogether distinct
                    from his main doctrine. It is materialistic, like nearly all the other early
                    Greek explanations of the universe. The universe (that is, the apparent
                    universe) is, he says, made up of two elements, one of which he describes as
                    heat and light, the other as cold and darkness. Of these elements all men are
                    composed, and their thinking varies as the proportions <pb break="no"

                    composition. Even the dead body feels cold and darkness.</p>
                <p>Zeno, born in the beginning of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    the fellow-townsman, disciple, and adopted son of Parmenides, is famous for his
                    attempts to prove that the notions of time, space, motion, multiplicity, sight,
                    sound, &amp;c., are selfcontradictory and unthinkable. His paradoxes were stated
                    with a subtlety which has forced thinkers even of distinction, who were opposed
                    to his main position, for instance, Sir William Hamilton, to admit some of them
                    to be unanswerable. Against motion Zeno directed several arguments, the most
                    celebrated being that of Achilles and the tortoise, which are founded upon the
                    confusion of that which is infinitely divisible with that which is infinite.
                    Against space Zeno argued that any space, however large, must be in a larger
                    space, this larger space again in a still larger, and so on ad infinitum.
                    Against the manifold he argued (1) that the manifold, being divisible into the
                    infinitely small, t.e,, into that which has no magnitude, can itself have none,
                    as divisions that have no magnitude must make up a whole without magnitude; and
                    (2) that, being divisible into an infinite number of parts, it must be
                    infinitely large. Against sound he argued—and he applied similar reasoning to
                    sight—that, as you cannot hear a single grain of corn fall, you cannot hear the
                    sound of a number of grains falling, the sound of the falling of the number of
                    grains being made up of the sounds of the falling of each grain. Thus Zeno
                    sought to prove that thought and sense are opposed, and that the latter,
                    contradicting itself, proves itself unworthy of the consideration of the
                    philosopher.</p>
                <p>The last of the Eleatic teachers was Melissus of Samos, the friend of Heraclitus,
                    who was probably born somewhat later than Zeno. We only possess fragments of his
                    works, preserved by Simplicius and collected by Brandis. His modifications of
                    the doctrines of his master, Parmenides, are not important, with the exception
                    of his assertion of the infinity, the unlimitedness, of “the One and All,” and
                    his distinct insistance upon the doctrine that the “One and All” is immaterial,
                    unextended, without parts.</p>
