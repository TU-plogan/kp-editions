                    mammals belonging to the order Proboscidea, containing only a single existing
                    genus and two species—the sole surviving representatives of the entire order.
                    The elephants are characterized by great massiveness of body, constituting <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0132-0123"/> them the largest of living terrestrial mammals,
                    by peculiarities in their dentition, and by the possession of a lengthened
                    proboscis or trunk. The latter organ is a huge prolongation of the nose and
                    upper lip, measuring usually from 6 to 8 feet in length, and almost wholly
                    composed of a mass of muscles, numbering, according to Cuvier, nearly 40,000,
                    and curiously interlaced, so as to produce the greatest diversity of motion. Its
                    extremity contains the two openings of the nostrils by which the elephant
                    breathes when swimming, as it sometimes does, with only the tip of its trunk
                    above the surface, and through which it can fill the channels of its trunk with
                    water, the flexibility of that organ enabling it to pour the liquid into its
                    mouth or to squirt it over the surface of its body. By a peculiar valvular
                    arrangement the water is prevented from penetrating into the bony nostrils. The
                    extremity of the trunk is produced on the upper surface into a finger-like
                    process, and ends beneath in a thick tubercle which acts the part of thumb to
                    the prolongation above, while the whole is exquisitely endowed with the sense of
                    touch, and so forms an organ of prehension comparable in many respects to the
                    human hand. With it the elephant collects its food and drink, discovers the
                    snares that are often set in its path, strikes its antagonist to the ground, and
                    gives vent to its rage in a shrill trumpet-like sound, hence the French name of
                    trompe for the proboscis, corrupted in our language into trunk. Without it the
                    animal is helpless, being unable even to feed itself; and, as if conscious of
                    the vital importance of this organ, the elephant is exceedingly cautious in
                    using it, preferring when in combat with the tiger to fight with its trunk
                    carried aloft, out of reach of its antagonist’s claws. When the trunk is injured
                    the elephant becomes furious with rage and pain, and can no longer be controlled
                    by its rider.</p>
                <p>The teeth of the elephant consist of two incisors, or tusks, as they are called,
                    in the upper jaw, and six molars on each side of either jaw. The permanent tusks
                    are preceded by small milk teeth, which, however, give place to their successors
                    before the end of the second year. The tusks, proceeding from a permanent pulp,
                    continue to grow during the elephant’s lifetime, and sometimes attain enormous
                    size, examples having been known to weigh from 150 to upwards of 200 lb each.
                    They consist almost entirely of ivory—a remarkably fine and elastic form of
                    dentine—and are hollow for a considerable part of their length. They are also
                    deeply imbedded in the skull; thus a tusk, about 8 feet long and 22 inches in
                    girth, was found by Sir Samuel Baker to be imbedded to a depth of 31 inches. The
                    tusks are invariably best developed in the male sex, and are regarded by Darwin
                    as sexual weapons. Their almost vertical position, however, and the inability of
                    the elephant to raise its head above the shoulder, render their use as offensive
                    weapons somewhat difficult; nevertheless they are certainly employed as such in
                    fighting with the tiger, the mode of using them depending, says Darwin, “on
                    their direction and curvature”—thus the elephant has been known to toss a tiger
                    to a distance of 30 feet with its tusks, when these were turned upward and
                    outward, while it seeks to pin its foe to the ground when these organs have the
                    usual downward direction. The tusks are largest in the African species, which
                    feeds principally on the foliage and the succulent roots of trees, and in this
                    species they are often used as levers in uprooting mimosa trees, whose crown of
                    foliage is beyond the reach of the upturned trunk. In Ceylon, on the other hand,
                    where the elephant lives chiefly on grass and herbage, tusks are generally
                    absent in both sexes. The bullets occasionally found imbedded in the solid ivory
                    have evidently been shot into the upper part of the tusk, and, getting lodged in
                    the pulp cavity, have been carried down by the growth of successive layers of
                    ivory into the solid part of the tooth. The molar teeth consist of a series of
                    transverse plates, composed of dentine, and coated with a layer of enamel, the
                    whole bound together by the substance known as crusta petrosa, or cement. Each
                    of these materials, possessing a different degree of hardness, wears away at a
                    different rate from the others, and the uneven surface necessary for the proper
                    trituration of the food is thus produced. Although the elephant may be said to
                    have altogether six molars on each side of either jaw, at no time can more than
                    one and a portion of a second be seen. These molars are not deciduous in the
                    ordinary sense, but they grow from behind forward, and as the auterior part of
                    the front molar gets worn away by degrees, its successor is gradually cutting
                    its way through the gum, from which, however, it does not wholly emerge until
                    the tooth in front has almost disappeared. This progression of the molar teeth
                    continues throughout the greater part of the elephant’s life, so that it may be
                    said to be always teething. Six of such molars, each composed of a greater
                    number of plates than its predecessor, are said to suffice it for life. The
                    massiveness of the skull, and its height in front, to which the elephant owes
                    something of its sagacious aspect, is due not to the great size of the
                    brain—which is relatively small—but to the enormous development of the bones of
                    the cranium, rendered necessary in order to give attachment to the powerful
                    muscles of the head and trunk. The presence of large air cells, however, in the
                    cranial bones, renders the skull light in proportion to its enormous bulk. The
                    eyes in the elephant are small, and its range of vision, owing to the shortness
                    and slight flexibility of its neck, is somewhat circumscribed; this, however, is
                    of secondary importance to an animal living generally in dense forests, where
                    the prospect is necessarily limited, and in the elephant is compensated for by
                    exceeding keenness in the senses of hearing and smell. Its stomach resembles
                    that of the camel in having a chamber which can be cut off from the proper
                    digestive cavity for the storing of water; this is capable of holding 10
                    gallons. The contents of this chamber it is able to convey into its trunk,
                    should it wish to indulge its body in the luxury of a shower bath. The elephant
                    is an unwieldy creature, weighing fully 3 tons, and supported on colossal limbs,
                    which from their straightness and apparent want of flexibility—an effect
                    produced by the greater nearness of the knee and elbow to the ground than in
                    most animals—were for centuries supposed either to be jointless, or to have such
                    joints as could not be used. Such evidently was Shakespeare’s belief when he
                    wrote—</p>
                <p>“The elephant hath joints, but not for courtesy;</p>
                <p>His legs are for necessity, not flexure.”</p>
                <p>This delusion was further supported by the fact that the elephant often sleeps
                    standing, its huge body leaning against a tree or rock. In lying down it does
                    not place the hind legs beneath it, as is generally the case, but extends them
                    backwards after the manner of a person kneeling. By this method the elephant can
                    raise its huge weight with little perceptible effort. The feet are furnished
                    with five toes, completely enveloped in a tegumentary cushion, and with four or
                    five nails on each of the front feet, and three or four on the hind ones,
                    according to the species. The skin of the elephant is thick and soft, and of a
                    dark brown colour. With the exception of a few hairs on certain parts of its
                    body, it is naked, although individuals found in the elevated districts of
                    Northern India are said to be more hairy than those inhabiting warmer regions,
                    while the young everywhere, according to Tennent, are at first covered with a
                    woolly fleece, especially about the head and shoulders, approximating in this
                    respect to the mammoth which inhabited the alaearctic region during Pleistocene
                    times. From such facts Darwin regards it as <pb break="no"

                    hairy covering through exposure to tropical heat. The elephant continues to grow
                    for upwards of 30 years, and to live for more than 100, there being
                    well-authenticated cases of elephants that lived over 130 years in captivity.
                    The female is capable of breeding after 15 years, and produces a single young
                    one, rarely two, at a birth, the period of gestation extending over nearly 21
                    months. The young elephant sucks with its mouth, and not, as was formerly
                    supposed, with its trunk.</p>
                <p>Elephants are polygamous, associating together in considerable herds, under the
                    guidance of a single leader, whom they implicitly follow, and whose safety, when
                    menaced, they are eager to secure. These herds often do great damage to rice and
                    other grain fields in cultivated districts, trampling under foot what they
                    cannot eat. A slight fence is, however, generally sufficient to prevent their
                    inroads, the elephant regarding all such structures with the greatest suspicion,
                    connecting them probably, in some way, with snares and pitfalls. At times this
                    usually inoffensive animal is subject to fits of temporary fury, and an elephant
                    iu “must,” as this frenzied condition is termed, is regarded as the most
                    dangerous of animals. When an elephant, from whatever cause, leaves the herd to
                    which it belongs, it is not allowed .to join the ranks of another, but ever
                    after leads a solitary life. Those individuals are known as “rogues;” being
                    soured in temper by exclusion from the society of their kind, they become
                    exceedingly ferocious, attacking without provocation whatever crosses their
                    path.</p>
                <p>There are two existing species of elephants—the African and the Asiatic. The
                    African Elephant (Elep)has afi·icanus) differs in so many important particulars
                    from the Asiatic form as to have been placed by many naturalists, and apparently
                    with sufficient reason, in a separate genus— Loxodon. The enamel on the crown of
                    its molar teeth is arranged across the surface in lozenge-shaped figures,
                    instead of the nearly parallel transverse ridges of the other species. Its ears
                    are enormously large, completely covering the shoulder when thrown back; they
                    have been known to measure 3⅛ feet in length and 2∣ feet in width. Its forehead
                    also is convex, and its back concave, while in the other the forehead is almost
                    flat, and the back convex. The African elephant ranges over the whole of Africa
                    south of the Sahara, with the exception of the Cape, where it formerly abounded,
                    but from which it has been driven by man. In height it somewhat exceeds the
                    Asiatic species, although never standing more than 11 feet high at the
                    shoulders. Its tusks are also heavier, and occur in both sexes, although iu the
                    female they are comparatively small, a male tusk usually weighing about 50 lb,
                    while that of the female rarely exceeds 10 lb, “The tusks of the African
                    elephant," says Baker, “are seldom alike. As a man uses his right hand in
                    preference to his left, so the elephant works with a particular tusk which is
                    termed by the traders el-hadâm (the servant); this is naturally more worn than
                    the other, and is usually about 10 lb lighter.” They roam among the long grass
                    on the open plains, in the neighbourhood of water, of which both species are
                    excessively fond, feeding on the leaves and roots of trees, and using their
                    tusks to overthrow such as are too strong to be pulled down by their powerful
                    trunks. The traveller just quoted states that he has observed trees 4 feet G
                    inches in circumference, and about 30 feet high, thus uprooted. He was assured
                    by the natives, however, that in such cases the elephants assisted each other.
                    Until comparatively recent times the natives of Africa hunted the elephant
                    exclusively for its flesh, of which they are particularly fond; but since the
                    arrival of the Arab traders, the natives, who formerly regarded the tusks as
                    mere bones, and left them to rot along with the rest of the skeleton, have
                    discovered the value of ivory, and this has led to the destruction of these
                    animals on a much larger scale than formerly. England alone imports 1,200,000 lb
                    of ivory annually, in order to obtain which, the lives of probably 30,000
                    elephants are sacrificed; and it has been estimated by a recent writer on this
                    subject that, in order to supply the demand for ivory throughout the world, at
                    least 100,000 individuals are annually slain. As the elephant is the slowest
                    breeder of all known animals, should the slaughter continue on its present
                    scale, the total extinction of tusk-bearing elephants is.probably not far
                    distant. The African elephant was in ancient times domesticated by the
                    Carthaginians, who employed it in their wars with Rome. It was this species
                    which crossed the Alps with Hannibal, and which the Romans, after the conquest
                    of Carthage, made use of in war, in the amphitheatre, and in military pageants.
                    No African race has since succeeded in reclaiming this highly intelligent and
                    naturally docile animal—a fact often quoted in proof of the general inferiority
                    of the negro race. Although common in Europe during the ascendency of the Roman
                    empire, for centuries after it was almost unknown; and it was only in 18G5 that
                    the Zoological Society of London obtained a pair for their gardens. These are
                    still living.</p>
                <p>The Asiatic Elephant (Elephas indicus) inhabits the wooded parts of the Oriental
                    region, from India and Ceylon eastward to the frontiers of China, and to Sumatra
                    and Borneo. It chiefly abounds in the jungle, and probably on this account is
                    less active and fierce than the African form. It is not, however, partial, as
                    was at one time supposed, to low grounds and sultry heat, abounding, in India
                    and Ceylon, principally among the hilly and even mountainous districts.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n134/mode/1up"

                <p>where the cold is often considerable. It is exceedingly sure-footed, and shows
                    remarkable sagacity in its choice of a route over mountain districts. It feeds
                    largely on grass, and, according to Tennent, the stems of plantain, stalks of
                    sugar-cane, and the feathery tops of bamboo are irresist-able luxuries, and
                    fruits of every description are eaten voraciously. The tusks grow to a
                    considerable size in the male, but are wanting in the female; while in the
                    Ceylon elephant, which by Schlegel, Tennent, and others is considered as
                    forming, with the Sumatran elephant, a distinct species {Elephas sumatrαnus),
                    tusks are also absent in the female, and only exceptionally present in the male.
                    The latter, however, generally has a pair of upper incisors, known as “tushes,”
                    about a foot long, and one or two inches in diameter. The domestication of the
                    Asiatic elephant dates from time immemorial, the earliest records in which it is
                    mentioned showing that it was then chiefly employed in war. Elephants thus
                    figured in the armies of the kings of India, when these monarchs sought to repel
                    the invasions of Alexander the Great and of Tamerlane; but, however formidable
                    looking, they could not withstand the impetuous dash of well-armed and
                    well-disciplined troops. The sabres of the invaders, aimed at their trunks,
                    rendered the elephants totally unmanageable, and, in the confusion that ensued,
                    they generally did more harm to their own side than to the enemy. Great wooden
                    towers, capable it is said of accommodating 32 soldiers, were usually fastened
                    to the back of the war elephant, and under cover of these the archers aimed
                    their shafts. Since the introduction of firearms, the elephant has become still
                    less serviceable as an “arm of war,” and is now only employed in dragging heavy
                    artillery, and in the transport of baggage.</p>
                <p>Elephants have been known to breed in captivity, and were thus bred, according to
                    Aelian, in ancient Rome, but such an event in India or Ceylon is of the rarest
                    occurrence, although in Ava, probably owing to the fact that the females are
                    allowed to roam in the woods in a semi-wild state, such births are common.
                    Domesticated individuals, in India and Ceylon, have thus been all reclaimed from
                    the wild state, and the gaps caused by death can only be filled by fresh
                    captures. Single wild males are often caught through the agency of tame females
                    acting as decoys. When it is sought to capture whole herds, the Hindus and
                    Singalese construct, in the heart of the forest, a vast inclosure known
                    osal·eddah or corral, formed of the trunks and branches of trees, with an
                    opening on one side, into which the herd is driven. This, however, can only be
                    accomplished by thousands of beaters making an extensive circuit round the
                    haunts of the elephants, and gradually narrowing the circle until a
                    comparatively limited area is completely inclosed. Around this, in order
                    todimiuish the chances of escape, fires are kindled at frequent intervals, and
                    at last the beaters, with a general rush, and carrying lighted torches, close in
                    upon the elephants, and the affrighted creatures, seeing no way clear except in
                    the direction of the inclosure, make for it with all speed, and enter the
                    corral. Once they are inside, the entrance is barricaded, and the entrapped
                    elephants rush wildly about in the vain hope of finding a means of escape. When
                    completely exhausted, they seek the centre of the inclosure, and there await
                    motionless the progress of events. Several tame elephants, each bearing a mahout
                    or keeper, and with a nooser following behind on foot, then enter the corral,
                    and, the tame elephants mingling freely with the wild captives, the latter are
                    put off their guard, and an opportunity is given to the attendant on foot to
                    pass the noose of a rope, the other end of which is attached to the neck of one
                    of the tame elephants, over each of its legs in succession. It is then securely
                    tied to the trunk of a tree. The process of training, in which kindness and
                    severity both play a part, occupies a comparatively short period, being greatly
                    hastened by the sagacious co-ôperation of tame individuals. “This assistance,”
                    says Tennent, “can generally be dispensed with after two months, and the captive
                    may then be ridden by the driver alone, and after three or four months he may be
                    intrusted with labour, so far as regards docility.” Males are generally more
                    difficult to tame than females, and “rogues’ <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> are
                    the most difficult of all; the worst, however, may be reclaimed by patience and
                    kindness. In captivity elephants are subject to a great variety of diseases, and
                    their rate of mortality is exceedingly high, more than half of those employed in
                    the Government service of Ceylon dying after a single year of servitude. Their
                    great strength, sagacity, and docility render them valuable as beasts of burden,
                    and they have been largely employed in the East in road-making and
                    bridge-budding, being used for dragging timber, moving stones, &lt;fcc. A
                    powerful elephant is able, it is said, to lift and carry on its tusk a log of
                    wood weighing half a ton. Having regard to the great expense of their
                    maintenance, a working elephant consuming daily about 2 cwts. of green stuff and
                    half a bushel of grain, as well as to their frequent illnesses, their employment
                    is now considered less economical than that of horses, and consequently their
                    use as beasts of burden is gradually decreasing. In India, however, the elephant
                    is largely employed in hunting the tiger, the sportsman stalking this feline
                    game from the comparative security of the howdαh fixed on its back, while its
                    motions are directed by the mahout seated on its neck.</p>
                <p>White elephants are merely albinos. They are extremely rare, and great store is
                    set upon them among the independent kingdoms of Further India—the chief white
                    elephant at the court of Siam ranking next to the queen, and taking precedence
                    of the heir apparent! Although not an object of worship in those countries, the
                    white elephant is considered a necessary adjunct to royalty, the want of it
                    being regarded as ominous; and in the 16th century a protracted war was waged
                    between Siam, Pegu, and Aracan, in the course of which five kings were killed,
                    for the possession of a particular white elephant.</p>
                <p>Although now containing only two living forms, the family of elephants vas in
                    past geological periods much richer in species,—fossil remains of no fewer than
                    14 specie3 of the genus Elephas, and a still larger number belonging to the
                    allied genus Mastodon having been found in the Tertiary formations, to which
                    their remains are confined. The earliest elephants occur in the Miocene deposits
                    of Northern India. In the Pliocene period they make their appearance in Europe,
                    the most noteworthy species of that time being the Elephas αηiiquus, a southern
                    form, which, surviving the rigours of the Glacial period, continued on into
                    Pleistocene times. During the latter period elephants first appear in America,
                    such forms as the Mammoth {Elephas primigenius} ranging over the northern
                    regions of both hemispheres. The mammoth is undoubtedly the most interesting of
                    all the extinct elephants, owing partly to its having co-existed with man, as is
                    proved by the numerous flint implements and other human utensils found along
                    with its remains, and also to the perfect state of preservation in which these
                    have been found. At the beginning of the present century, a Siberian hunter
                    discovered an entire mammoth, frozen in a block of ice, and another has since
                    been found,—both so perfectly preserved that microscopic sections of some of the
                    tissues were able to be made. These specimens showed that this huge creature,
                    unlike existing elephants, was thickly clad in a covering of long dark hair,
                    mixed at the roots with shorter hair of a woolly texture, that it possessed a
                    mane, and that it had tusks of enormous length curved upwards to fully ∣ffis of
                    a circle. Its remains are found abundantly in England<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n135/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0135-0126"/>, and throughout the greater part of Northern
                    Europe and Asia. They are specially abundant in Siberia, where the tusks are so
                    plentiful and so well preserved as to form an important article of trade,
                    supplying, it is said, almost the whole of the ivory used in Russia. In Malta
                    the remains of two pigmy elephants—the one 4∣ feet high at the shoulder and the
                    other only 3 feet—have been discovered. The mastodons differed from the true
                    elephants chiefly in their dentition, having a greater number of molars, and
                    having these crowned with prominent tubercles arranged in pairs; they had also
                    tusks in both jaws, those in the lower, however, never attaining great length,
                    and often falling out during the lifetime of the mastodon.</p>
