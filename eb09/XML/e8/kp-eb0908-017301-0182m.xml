                <p><label type="entry">EMIGRATION</label>, now one of the most constant and orderly
                    movements of human society, must have been one of the earliest, however
                    irregular, of human impulses. It is the act of men, families, tribes, or parts
                    of tribes, leaving the place of their birth with the.view of settling in some
                    other place. They are emigrants in the country they leave, and immigrants in the
                    country they pass into. But this converse nomenclature describes an identical
                    class of persons and the same kind of adventure, more necessary now than £ver to
                    be distinguishedffrom migrations within a given territory, or the frequent
                    travellings between distant countries in which many engage, whether on purposes
                    of business or pleasure. Emigration is a going out with a design of permanently
                    settling in new seats of residence, labour, trade, and society. It is the
                    practical response which mankind have given in all ages to the command to
                    “multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it or, in other words, it is a
                    necessary result of the increase of population within a limited though cherished
                    space, and of the appointed destiny of our race to people and develop the
                    world.</p>
                <p>The natural law of population, though probably the deep underlying force of all
                    emigrations, is not the only force at work in the general movement by which
                    people, and race3 of people, have migrated from one part of the world to
                    another. Not only famines, which may be said to present the pressure of
                    population in its intensest form, but wars of official conquest and ambition,
                    religious persecu∙ tions and religious phantasies, civil broils and political
                    revolutions, the discovery of gold and silver mines, the envy of more genial
                    climes and fertile lands than people have been born to, the individual love of
                    change and adventure and pushing one’s fortune, have considerable power in
                    promoting emigrations, apart from the rude pressure of physical wants. Famines
                    in India, for example, do not result in much emigration; and yet the Irish
                    famine in 1846-7 led immediately to one of the most remarkable removals of
                    persons and families from one hemisphere to another in modern times. It would be
                    difficult to account by the law of population for the successive immigrations of
                    Saxons, Danes, and Normans into England, or to maintain that it was a force of
                    hunger only which impelled the Northern barbarians to attack the Roman Empire.
                    In the invasion of Turkey in 1877 the Russian soldiers are said to have been
                    surprised at the plenty of the Bulgarian towns and villages, and to have had
                    curious reflections why they should have been led so far afield to battle for
                    the relief of a population so much more comfortably bestowed than themselves.
                    Yet when the Russian soldiers return to their comparatively sterile homes,
                    having seen the abundance of grain and fruits and flowers on the slopes of the
                    Balkans, their accounts will probably only increase the Muscovite passion to
                    penetrate by force of arms into more productive regions than those of Northern
                    Europe and Asia. We must allow, in short, for many causes of emigration, as well
                    as many wrong views of the means by which the advantages of emigration are to be
                    realized.</p>
                <p>The passage of Scripture which relates what took place between Abraham and Lot in
                    the plains of Bethel, adduced by J. R. M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Culloch
                    in the article “Emigration” in the last edition of this work, will always remain
                    a strikingly natural and suggestive picture of the outward movement of society
                    in its primitive elements. There was no want apparently of material resources.
                    “Is not the whole land before thee,” were the words of Abraham; and Lot, lifting
                    up his eyes, saw the plain of Jordan unoccupied and well-watered. But there was
                    strife among the servants, quarrels as to pasturings and waterings, with
                    Canaanites and Perizzites dwelling in the land as an additional element of
                    disorder. The kinsmen could not agree, or adjust their rule; and separation
                    would be judicious, if not necessary. The narrative exhibits the influence of
                    individualism on human affairs—on the affair of emigration as on others. In
                    early times it was found difficult or impossible to make any important progress
                    on the basis of social unity.</p>
                <p>Nomads taking possession of vacant territory or invading the territory of others,
                    victorious kings carrying whole tribes or nations into captivity, citizens
                    driven ' out of civilized states by political rage, or attracted to adjacent
                    lands by the promised wealth of agriculture or trade, and colonies more or less
                    officially organized in the track of war and conqùest, are the pictures we have
                    of emigration in the ancieηf world.</p>
                <p>“Many, of the emigrants from the Greek States, as Mr M ’ Culloch wrote in the
                    article above referred to, “consisted of citizens forced by the violence of
                    contending factions to seek new settlements in other countries. But Greece also
                    sent forth emigrants, impelled by the difficulty of maintaining themselves at
                    home, or allured by the glowing descriptions of the comparative abundance they
                    would enjoy in distant lands. Both tiιese classes of emigrants established
                    themselves, for the most part, either in countries with a scanty population, or
                    whose inhabitants were in a decidedly lower state of civilization. And the
                    greater refinement and ingenuity of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0183-0174"/> Greeks, and their industrious habits, enabled
                    them to make a rapid progress, so that several of these colonies became, in no v
                    ery lengthened period, populous and powerful states. . .</p>
                <p>“Few voluntary emigrants ever left Rome. The colonies which she sent forth were
                    intended to bridle subjugated provinces, and should be regarded rather as the
                    outposts of an immense army, the headquarters of which were at Rome, than as
                    establishments of individuals who had bid adieu to their mother country, and who
                    intended to maintain themselves in their new residence by their own
                    industry.</p>
                <p>“But in their wish to amend their condition, emigrants have not always been
                    contented to establish themselves in unoccupied or thinly-peopled countries.
                    Sometimes, as in the case of the irruption of the northern nations into the
                    Roman empire, they have attacked countries that were densely peopled, and,
                    having subdued the inhabitants, have seized upon the whole, or upon a greater or
                    less proportion of their lands.</p>
                <p>“Pastoral nations, inasmuch as they can carry with them the flocks and herds from
                    which they derive their subsistence, may emigrate in very large bodies, and
                    previously to the invention of gunpowder and other improvements in warfare were
                    very danger- ous neighbours. The danger was further increased, or rather was
                    perpetually kept up, by the fact that the emigration of one tribe or nation, by
                    making more room for those that remained behind, gave a corresponding stimulus
                    to population, so that, the vacuum being soon filled up, the motive to fresh
                    emigration became as great as ever. On this principle we are able to account
                    satisfactorily for the successive swarms of barbarians that, issuing from the
                    countries in the north of Europe, first attacked and ultimately overthrew the
                    colossal fabric of Roman power. It admits of demonstration that these countries
                    were then not nearly so populous as at present, that they had not more, perhaps,
                    than a fifth or a sixth part of the inhabitants by which they are now occupied.
                    But as they depended principally on pasturage, their numbers were often in
                    excess compared with their means of support. And the pressure of want, that is,
                    the necessity of finding additional room for their flocks and herds on the one
                    hand, and, on the other, the prospect of vast wealth and riches of which they
                    might hope to possess themselves, precipitated them into those expeditions in
                    which, though often defeated, they were in the end successful.”</p>
                <p>A movement which is to be recognized as one of the necessary conditions of human
                    progress is thus seen advancing in its early history from a collision of
                    interests, and receiving both impulse and advantage from all the discords, wars,
                    and difficulties of social and political life. It may be presumed,
                    notwithstanding the imperfect civilization of many large regions of the world,
                    that emigration has now attained so many ways and means, and so well-established
                    an order, as to proceed more spontaneously and functionally, and be less
                    indebted to violent forces for its impulsion, than in past times. The striking
                    modern form of emigration is the removal of individuals and families from their
                    native seats to distant countries, in large numbers, yet without concert and
                    without apparent distress, silently and intelligently, the emigrants knowing
                    what they are leaving and whither they are going. Emigration of this kind, like
                    the commerce in commodities, does not advance rapidly for a long period. The
                    first adventurers have often a rough experience, and do not invite others, but
                    gradually the number who succeed increases, and in their letters home encourage
                    relatives and friends to follow their example, and not unfrequently supply the
                    means of acting upon their advice. This, in a constant and cumulative form,
                    comes to have more real and wholesome influence than all the emigration aid
                    societies ever established, however useful these may have been in their place.
                    The traffic of the steam navigation companies during the last twenty-five years
                    would show how largely the volume of free and well-considered emigration has
                    thus been increased; and, indeed, it may be observed that emigration of this
                    kind has received much the same impetus as material commerce from the ocean
                    steamers, railways, telegraphs, and other greatly improved means of
                    transmission. The movement is liable to its own fluctuations; it ebbs and flows
                    from one year to another; but of its permanence and extension there can be no
                    reasonable doubt.</p>
                <p>Trite as this may appear, it is worthy of being observed how rapidly the change
                    has been evolved. In the thirty years from 1815 to 1845 the annual emigration
                    from the United Kingdom to all parts had not increased to 100,000 souls. The
                    total number of emigrants in 1815 was only 2081, in the following year 12,510,
                    and 20,634 in 1817. This was the starting-point on the close of the great
                    European wars; and at the end of thirty years of peace, what progress had been
                    made? In 1843 the total number of emigrants from the United Kingdom was 57,212;
                    it was 70,686 in 1844, and 93,501 in 1845. Only in three years of the long
                    interval, viz., 1832, 1841, and 1842, had the annual emigration risen to or
                    above 100,000. But 1847, in which year the emigration rose to 258,270, marks the
                    beginning of unwonted increase, sustained over many years in succession, and,
                    with some exceptional years, sustained, indeed, to the present time. The average
                    annual emigration in the five years ending 1853 was 323,002, whereas from 1815
                    to the same year 1853 it had only been 97,269. The Irish famine, ensuing on an
                    almost total failure of the potato crops, was the first in the order of events
                    to which this remarkable increase of emigration is to be ascribed; but the
                    Californian and Australian gold discoveries, the political reaction caused by
                    the coup d’etat in France, the failure of the European revolutions of 1848, and
                    the rising spirit of enterprise and growing prosperity following on the adoption
                    of free trade in the United Kingdom, by which the industry and production of all
                    the emigrant-receiving countries were largely promoted, prolonged the impulse
                    which had first been given by a sharp distress affecting more parts of Europe
                    than Ireland, and placed emigration on the more voluntary and substantial basis
                    which has characterized it of late years. The way was made so plain by the ocean
                    steamers and railways, which trade and capital were bringing into rapid action,
                    that larger numbers of people saw the advantage of passing over great distances
                    from one hemisphere to another. It was not till 1855 that any relapse occurred
                    in the large annual totals of emigration from the United Kingdom; and so late as
                    the five years 1869-73 the average number per year of emigrants from British
                    ports was 274,645.</p>
                <p>This increase of emigration was not confined to the United Kingdom. It was
                    European; and, indeed, our emigration statistics always include some proportion
                    of emigrants from neighbouring countries, who ship from British ports. But from
                    the north of Europe—from Scandinavia and Germany—there has been a largely
                    increased emigration during this period, proceeding under much the same
                    incitements and facilities as from England, Scotland, and Ireland. From France
                    the emigration has not been so marked as from many less poprdous countries. The
                    German race have peopled the United States so largely as to have become a
                    prominent element in the Transatlantic republic; but no one hears of the French
                    as one of the constitutents of a commonwealth which they helped materially to
                    found, and where they must always be held in esteem. The emigration of France
                    follows her own colonies and traditions chiefly; it is found in Louisiana and in
                    Canada, and almost everywhere discursively and thinly; and in much the same way
                    the Spaniards and Italians still lean in their emigration to La Plata and South
                    America, where there is a trace of ancestry, and their language is spoken. The
                    industrial motive and faculty, however, now draw emigrants from all the European
                    nations into the most various parts of the New World. In Australia and other
                    southern climes, where the grape has found an extended cultivation, Rhineland
                    and Cisalpine vine-dressers are at work. The Highland Scotch cling to Canada,
                    and prefer New Zealand to the Australian mainland; but the engineers of the
                    Lowland Clyde, ubiquitous as their ships, are found <pb break="no"

                    the sea-washed surface of the globe. To complete this sketch it must be added
                    that the Chinese—the most numerous while the most isolated nationality in the
                    world—have also become emigrants in large numbers, though it may be doubted
                    whether the Chinese immigration to the Pacific coast of the United States has as
                    its object a permanent change of country, or differs yet at least essentially
                    from the coolie migrations from India and China to the Eastern Archipelago, or
                    of South Sea Islanders to Queensland and other parts of Australia, which are
                    more of the nature of a transfer of labour for a term of years than a definite
                    emigration of both sexes and of families. The number of Chinese in the United
                    States, according to the census of 1870, was 63,199, and in the Australian
                    colony of Victoria at the same period 17,935—in both cases nearly all males. In
                    an elaborate report on coolie emigration from India by Mr Geoghegan, presented
                    to parliament in 1874, it appears—to take Ceylon as an example—that in the ten
                    years ending 1869 the average annual number of persons removing from Madras to
                    that island was 65,000 (of whom 50,000 were adult males), and that the average
                    annual number who returned from Ceylon to Madras was 48,000. A constant coming
                    and going is the feature of all coolie emigration, whether from India or from
                    China. The Chinese have a superstitious desire to die within the borders of
                    their own sacred land. Nevertheless, their strong and persistent movement to the
                    Western world is a significant phenomenon. It has broken through all restraints
                    at home, and it has held its ground, in the face of no little social hostility,
                    from San Francisco to New York and other cities on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
                <p>Foreign and colonial emigration, in short, is now so widely practised, and has
                    been rendered by improved means of transit so safe and expeditious, that its
                    continued progress is not only sure, but one may foresee, from the various
                    forces in play, that at no distant time it will have become, over the largest
                    portion of the world, as familiar as migration from one province of the same
                    country to another. The attitude and duties of states, and of the populations of
                    states, towards a movement which comes into contact at many points with existing
                    laws and interests—laws of naturalization, military conscription, and
                    allegiance, with asserted rights of labour, and with social, religious, and
                    international prejudices—have thus become questions of much importance.</p>
                <p>Nothing is more certain than that nearly all the old countries suffered in past
                    times from want of emigration, unless it be that all the new countries have
                    greatly benefited by it. Leaving China out of view, where foreign immigrants
                    have only been tolerated under treaties extorted by force of arms, there has
                    been a general approval of emigration on the one hand, and of immigration on the
                    other. In the United Kingdom the population are singularly free to choose either
                    their own country or its colonies or other countries as the place of their
                    abode. They are under no compulsory military service; aud emigration has been
                    actively encouraged by societies and protected by the Government for half a
                    century. The greatest obstacle to free emigration from the Continent would
                    appear to be the system of military conscription. Every German of twenty or
                    twenty-one years is liable to personal service in the standing army for seven
                    years—three of active service, four in the reserve—and to other five years in
                    the landwehr, with the landsturm behind the landwehr making further demands on
                    the time and liberty of the subject. In France a similar system is now enforced,
                    though under more liberal exemptions. It is but fair.to state that Germany,
                    exclusive of Prussia, has up to this time been sufficiently free in its
                    emigration to have sent to the United States from 1820 to 1870 not fewer than
                    2,267,500 persons, which is nearly as many as have gone from Ireland to the
                    United States in the same half céntury, viz., 2,700,493. But from Prussia, where
                    the conscription has been longest in rigorous operation, the number of emigrants
                    to the United States in the same period has been only 100,983, and from France
                    245,812. Though the conscription may not be the sole cause of this, yet the
                    demands made by the great military powers on the drilling and fighting services
                    of the whole youth and manhood of their populations are obviously obstructive to
                    the pursuit of industry and fortune in foreign countries or in colonies. These
                    demands may be relaxed from time to time, while the system itself is maintained;
                    but they are relaxed with a grudge, and the Governments acquire inordinate ideas
                    of the irrevocable allegiance of their subjects. If the latter are permitted to
                    emigrate, it is undercondition of being liable to recall on brief notice to the
                    standards of their country; and an armed truce, such as has prevailed in the
                    most civilized nations of the Continent of Europe during five or six years of
                    peace, might soon be as detrimental to free emigration as war itself, under
                    which it usually ceases for the time. From Russia none can emigrate without
                    permission of the czar; and a similar despotism over the subject is the rule of
                    the Ottoman empire. A state may be within its reasonable and proper line of duty
                    in promoting and aiding either emigration or immigration. But that the
                    permission of the state should be necessary to the one process or the other is
                    inconceivable, save in some rare and dire emergencies of war or politics.</p>
                <p>The duty of states in regard to emigration, viewed in what must now be the
                    generally accepted light of a necessary and wholesome function of the general
                    economy, thus resolves itself into a duty of regulation and guardianship under
                    the two categories, always presented, of the countries which the emigrants
                    leave, and the countries to which they go. The one are bound to see that
                    emigrant ships are well found and not overcrowded, and that adequate
                    arrangements are made for the provisioning, health, and safety of the passengers
                    in their transit; while the other are bound to give them shelter and guidance on
                    landing, to protect them from imposture, and to see that all pre-engagements
                    made with them be fulfilled. The commission of emigration in the United Kingdom,
                    early established as a branch of the colonial office, has laboured diligently in
                    introducing care and order into the sphere of foreign and colonial emigration,
                    as well as into the coolie immigration of the Eastern seas. The regulations in
                    the British home and colonial ports are embodied in two Acts of Parliament,
                    called the Passengers Acts 1855 and 1863, which contain the administrative code
                    on this subject in its statutory detail—only for “Commissioners of Emigration”
                    must now be read “Board of Trade,” the supervision of emigrant ships having
                    devolved on that department in connection with the general merchant shipping. Of
                    the regulations for the reception of immigrants, on the other hand, the
                    arrangements at New York afford probably one of the best examples. If no country
                    has had more to do with the shipping of emigrants than the United Kingdom, no
                    place has had more to do with their reception than the great American seaport;
                    and measures have been adopted there by which the abuses once prevailing have
                    been overcome, and at the same time all the arrangements for the comfort,
                    security, and guidance of immigrants have been placed on a satisfactory basis.
                    Emigrant ships are visited six miles from the port by health officers, and any
                    who may be sick or diseased are removed to hospitals under the care of the
                    commissioners of emigration or the quarantine commission. The others are
                    required to land at Castle Garden, where there is a large rotunda capable of
                    accommodating 4000 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0185-0176"/> persons, and where every immediate want of the
                    emigrants may be supplied without leaving the depot. Letters may be written for
                    them, or telegrams despatched to friends, or friends may be introduced
                    immediately on their credentials being presented. The utmost care is taken to
                    guard the immigrants from falling into bad hands, and every information is
                    afforded them as to how they shall best proceed in their respective objects. The
                    supervision thus exercised in the port is extended over the railways to the
                    various parts of the Union to which immigrants may be bound. Besides such
                    arrangements, no less honourable to the authorities of a country than
                    encouraging to the emigrant, direct inducements have frequently been held out to
                    settlers, both in the United States and the British colonies, in the form of
                    grants of land or land at a cheap price, and in assisted or free passages.
                    Unless it be when emigrants move in a large group or body, with the view of
                    settling together in one place, a free grant of land may prove illusory, from
                    not being suited to the industrial aptitudes of the emigrant or not situated in
                    a locality where he would choose to reside. But when the Government of a state
                    or colony offers assisted or free passages, it may be safely concluded that
                    there is immediate demand for the services of the emigrants; and, as in such
                    cases the classes of workpeople required are usually specified, there is an
                    additional security against misunderstanding or misadventure. It may be observed
                    that Her Majesty’s commissioners of emigration will not advise intending
                    emigrants where they should go or where their particular qualifications or
                    occupations are in most demand; but they will sometimes warn intending emigrants
                    where they should not go, and much evil might occasionally be averted were an
                    appeal made to this negative advice, more especially when tempting offers and
                    attractions are presented from quarters of the world in which the failures of
                    emigration have hitherto been much more frequent than the successes.<note

                    Circular—1877,” in which will be found the spirit of nearly all the statutes
                    (550) of states and colonies with which the emigration of the United Kingdom is
                    related.</p></note></p>
                <p>The discussions thirty or forty years ago on organized methods of colonization
                    have mostly disappeared in these later times. We hear no more of Mr Wakefield’s
                    scheme, though it was useful in familiarizing the public mind with the
                    conditions of settling population successfully on distant and unoccupied
                    territories. When a Highland community was evicted from its native glen in
                    Scotland, or a Highland clan was paralysed by the bankruptcy and ruin of its
                    chief, it contributed to their successful establishment in Canada that they
                    emigrated in a body, with such ties of kindred and loyalty as remained. Again,
                    at the present day, the solitary Icelanders, moved by a spirit of emigration
                    from the volcanic rock and desert to which their ancestors were driven by
                    despotism—and the Mennonites, invited into Russia by Paul to lay the foundation
                    of the great wheat trade of Odessa, and now under expulsion by Alexander II. for
                    refusing to bear arms, on the grounds of their original contract and
                    conscientious scruples, are settling, in successive groups, with much promise of
                    future happiness, in the Canadian province of Manitoba. From these and similar
                    instances one can readily perceive the utility of organized emigration, and can
                    scarcely doubt, so various and changeful is the condition of many isolated
                    populations of the world, that it will long be a subject of practical study. But
                    the reason, apparently, why modes and theories of colonization have almost
                    passed out of the sphere of politics is that colonies are now so numerous and
                    well established, and the means of entering into their social and industrial
                    life so easy, that the consideration of initial forms has in great measure been
                    superseded. Emigration moves of itself over vast areas of population, subject to
                    commercial and social causes in various parts of the world; and the duty of
                    states is chiefly to give it outlet, and as much security as good administration
                    can supply.</p>
                <p>The question whether countries receiving emigrants may not be called upon in some
                    cases to check the flow of immigration within their borders is less free of
                    difficulty than any similar question as regards the countries from which
                    emigrants proceed, Au example of what may happen has been seen in the Mormonism
                    of the United States, where the settlers were not only at variance with the
                    republic on so cardinal a point as the civil law of marriage, but at open war
                    with the federal jurisdiction and sovereignty of the soil. Similar perplexities
                    might arise from a large Chinese or other heathen immigration, intro-, ducing
                    customs and observances which, though called religious and claiming toleration,
                    could only be regarded as contrary to civil order, morality, and decency. Some
                    dilemma of the same sort may even occur in the emigrant-giving countries, as,
                    for instance, when trades-unionists, while deriving all the benefit of a large
                    outward flow of labour, fall upon foreign workmen who immigrate into the United
                    Kingdom with a violence and disorder which the law has not yet learned or been
                    able to prevent.</p>
                <p>The statistics of emigration and immigration are copious enough, but being
                    variously recorded by the numerous states and colonies, it is no easy task to
                    bring them together in a general table, or to reduce them within moderate com
                    pass. The countries receiving emigrants are usually more careful to distinguish
                    the nationalities of the persons than the countries which they leave, or rather
                    the countries from which they take their passage across the seas. In 1 853
                    “foreigners” first began to be distinguished from British subjects in the
                    returns of our emigration commissioners, and it may give some idea of the
                    proportion in which the foreign element enters into the emigration of the United
                    Kingdom to take a recent year. In 1874, for example, the emigrants who sailed
                    from Britain are classified as follows :—11G,490 English, 60,496 Irish, 20,286
                    Scotch, 38,465 foreigners, and 5277 “not distinguished.” Yet considerable as the
                    foreign element is in the United Kingdom statistics, its destination is small
                    towards either our North American or Australasian colonies, and flows in the
                    largest bulk to the United States, where the nationality of the immigrants is
                    minutely discriminated in the returns of the emigration bureau. The table given
                    below shows in decennial periods the main currents of European emigration and
                    its principal destinations during the half century from 1820 to 1869
                    inclusive.</p>
                <p>The “all other places,’’ under which term statistics usually embrace the
                    emigration not contained in the table, receive but a small though a growing
                    portion of the persons who leave Europe with a view to industrial settlement
                    elsewhere. There is the emigration to the River Plate, remarkable less for its
                    amount than for the hold it possesses over the Latin races; and there is the
                    emigration to the South African colonies, more promising of results in the
                    future than can be gathered from its actual progress, In the Cape Colony and its
                    various annexations there are 187,000 white or European settlers in a population
                    of 776,000; and in the special colony of Natal only about one-seventh of the
                    population are of European origin. The immigration to the River Plate in the six
                    years 1868—73 was 250,698; of which in 1872 and 1873, when the immigration was
                    largest, 56 per cent, were Italians, 19 Spaniards, 16 French, 3 British, 5
                    Germans, and 1 per cent, various,—the proportion of males being 73, and females
                    27.</p>

                            simplicity's sake, to give the emigration from the United Kingdom to
                            British North America and Australia, as here, in the gross. It had
                            always more or less of a foreign element not easily separable in the
                            returns from the English, Irish, and Scotch; and there has been a
                            constant interchange of emigrants and Immigrants between Canada and the
                            United States, which complicates the matter still more. A surer test of
                            the force of the respcc tive emigrations up to the latest period is the
                            number of alien-born inhabitants at the last census. In the Dominion of
                            Canada at the census of 1871 there were 219.451 native-born Irish,
                            144,999 English and Welsh, 121,074 Scotch, 64.447 United States
                            Americans, and 24,162 Germans. In the principal Australian
                            colony—victoria—at the census of the same year there were 164.2S7
                            native-born English, 6614 welsh, 56.210 Scotch, 100,468 Irish, 8995
                            Germans, and riparlv the same number of all other Europeans as of
                            Germans.</p></note></p></cell>

                <p>The preference of emigration to British North America began to yield to the
                    United States in the last five years of the decade 1830-39, when the politics of
                    Canada were much disturbed; and other causes in the next decennial period gave
                    an impulse in the same direction. But the effect of the potato famine of 1847 in
                    Ireland on the course of emigration that ensued has probably been rated much
                    beyond its due. It will be observed that the emigration of the Irish to the
                    United States greatly exceeded that of English and Scotch in 1820-29, and was
                    threefold greater in 1830-39 than it had been in 1820-29, while that of English
                    and Scotch had much decreased. Taking into account these phenomena of the
                    preceding twenty years, it is difficult to believe that more than 300,000 of the
                    Irish emigration to the United States in 1840-49 can be accounted for by a
                    failure of potato crops occurring in 1846-7. More than that number of Irish
                    displaced by the famine were absorbed in the industry of England and Scotland,
                    of which the census returns since give abundant proof. If in the following
                    decade, 1850-59, the Irish emigration to the United States rose to the enormous
                    total of 1,073,065, it was accompanied by the no less surprising and much more
                    sudden emigration of 935,171 Germans to the same quarter, pointing to more
                    general causes than a local failure of crops, and showing how fruitfully the
                    nations of the Old World may people the New with advantage to their social life,
                    their trade, and their political stability, and to the general well-being. <hi
