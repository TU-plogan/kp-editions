                <p><label type="entry">EMETICS</label>, substances which are administered for the
                    purpose of producing vomiting. They are usually regarded as of two varieties,
                    viz., those which produce their effect in virtue of their absorption into the
                    blood and consequent influence upon the nerve centres, and those which act
                    topically on the mucous membrane of the stomach, giving rise to vomiting as the
                    result of reflex action. The former class of emetics are slower in their
                    operation and are attended with much greater depression of the system and
                    antecedent nausea than the latter, the action of which is prompt. The use of
                    emetics in medicine is comparatively rare, although at one time they were often
                    resorted to in the early stages of acute diseases, such as fevers and
                    inflammations, with the object of cutting them short. Their power, however, to
                    accomplish this is more than questionable. Among the purposes for which emetics
                    are employed are the following—to empty the stomach in certain cases of
                    poisoning, such as by narcotics or where indigestible substances are giving rise
                    to disturbance which calls for their removal, and to clear the air passages of
                    obstructions, as in certain cases of bronchitis or croup, where the respiratory
                    tubes become filled with morbid material which threatens death by asphyxia, and
                    which cannot be dislodged by coughing, For both these purposes the stimulating
                    emetics are to be preferred, such as the sulphates of zinc and copper, or, where
                    these are not available, mustard stirred into water. Again, emetics are employed
                    in producing, short of their emetic action, a certain degree of nausea and
                    consequent relaxation during the early stages of acute inflammation in strong
                    persons, and for this purpose the more depressing emetics are resorted to, such
                    as antimony, ipecacuanha, apomorphia, &amp;c. The latter are likewise employed
                    in obstetric practice with the view of producing relaxation in cases of
                    protracted labour from uterine and muscular rigidity. Emetics ought always to be
                    administered with caution, since the act of vomiting may be attended with danger
                    where there exists any tendency to brain disease or in cases of disease of
                    internal organs; or further, from the vomiting continuing longer than was
                    intended, injury may be done to the mucous membrane of the stomach as well as
                    serious shock inflicted on the system.</p>
