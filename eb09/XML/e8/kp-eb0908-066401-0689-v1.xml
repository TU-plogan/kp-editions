                <p><label type="entry">EULENSPIEGEL</label>, in French <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ulespiegle,</hi> in older English <hi rend="italic">Hoivleglas,</hi> one of
                    the most popular of European chapbooks, consisting in all its innumerable
                    rifacimentos of stories of ludicrous roguery, in which the love of fun is not
                    unmingled with the love of mischief. The name in its present form is equivalent
                    to Noctuae Speculum or Owl’s Mirror, and may be compared with such appellations
                    as Schwabenspiegel, Sachsenspiegel, Laienspiegel, Speculum historiale, Speculum
                    Conversionis Peccatorum, Speculum de Passione Domini nostri Jesu Christi, the
                    Mirror of theWorld, the Mirror for Magistrates, the Steele Glas, and a hundred
                    others of the same type. It may possibly have arisen early in the Middle Ages,
                    and it is distinctly mentioned in a book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Generibus Ebriosorum,</hi> or “Concerning the kinds of
                    drunkards,” published in 1515. No definitive explanation has been given of the
                    origin of the name, but one interpretation makes it rest on the fact that man
                    recognizes his faults no more than an owl that looks into a mirror, and another
                    finds the original form in the Low German Ul en Spiegel, or Ul den Spiegel,
                    which would signify “Cleanse the looking glass.” The popularity of the book has
                    not only enriched literary German with the words <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eulenspiegelei,</hi> waggery, <hi rend="italic">Euleηsρiegcln,</hi> to play
                    the wag, Ac., but it has furnished French with <hi rend="italic">espiègle</hi>

                <p>“Ride on my best invention like an asse To the amazement of each Owliglasse.”</p>
                <p>According to an old tradition, the tricks and jests of the collection are
                    attributed to a certain Till or Tyll Eulenspiegel, otherwise Till the Saxon or
                    Tylus Saxonicus, who was born at Kneitlingen near Schoppeustadt, in the duchy of
                    Brunswick, and was the son of Claus Eulenspiegel and Anna Wortbeck. He is
                    usually stated to have been buried in 1350 at Mölln, about four leagues from
                    Lubeck, but the people of Damme in Belgium claim that his grave is with them. At
                    Mölln, to quote an old book of travels cited by Nares, the townsmen “yearly keep
                    a feast for his memory, and yet show the appareil he was wont to wear ;” and his
                    tomb was adorned with a fantastic effigy, holding in one hand a little tankard
                    with a jack-in-a-box, and in the other a basket full of little mannikins with
                    fool’s caps on their heads. That there was such a person as Tyl seems not
                    improbable, but what connexion he had with the Owlglass it is hard to discover;
                    Eulenspiegel at least* is pretty certainly a later addition to his name. Mr
                    William F. Thoms found the Irish peasantry telling stories of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Old Espeel,</hi> and a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's
                        Magazine,</hi> September 1877, Mr David Fitzgerald, “met with pretty clear
                    traces of Eulenspiegel in the traditions of the county of Limerick, where he
                    figures as one <hi rend="italic">Ulas,</hi> whose confession, like that of his
                    prototype, is yet a favourite tale.”</p>

                    edition at Bruges, 1835, and another at Brussels, 1840; and a complete
                    translation into modern French from the 1519 edition was printed at Paris by P.
                    Jannet, 1858. An English edition was published in 1860, under the direction of
                    Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie, and with illustrations by Alfred Crowquill. In 1865
                    appeared a photolithographic reprint of the Lower Saxon version, originally
                    printed by Servais KruiΓter (Servetius Cruftanus). There is no complete copy of
                    the original, but portions in the Royal Library at Vienna and in the Royal
                    Library at Berlin complete each other.</p>
