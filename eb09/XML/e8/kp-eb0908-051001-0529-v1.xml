                <p><label type="entry">EQUITY</label> in its most general sense means justice; in
                    its most technical sense it means a system of law, or a body of connected legal
                    principles, which have superseded or supplemented the common law on the ground
                    of their intrinsic superiority. Aristotle <hi rend="italic">(Ethics,</hi> bk. v.
                    c. 10) defines equity as a better sort of justice, which corrects legal justice
                    where the latter em through being expressed in a universal form and not taking
                    account of particular cases. When the law speaks universally, and something
                    happens which is not according to the common course of events, it is right that
                    the law should be modified in its application to that particular case, as the
                    lawgiver himself would have done, if the case had been present to his mind.
                    Accordingly the equitable man (∈7∏εtκ7)ς) is he who does not push the law to its
                    extreme, but, having legal justice on his side, is disposed to make allowances.
                    Equity as thus described would correspond rather to the judicial discretion
                    which modifies the administration of the law than to the antagonistic system
                    which claims to supersede the law.</p>
                <p>The part played by equity in the development of Jaw is admirably illustrated in
                    the well-known work of Sir Henry Maine on <hi rend="italic">Ancient Law.</hi>
                    Positive law, at least in progressive societies, is constantly tending to fall
                    behind public opinion, and the expedients adopted for bringing it into harmony
                    therewith are three, viz., legal fictions, equity, and statutory legislation.
                    Equity here is defined to mean “any body of rules existing by the side of the
                    original civil law, founded on distinct principles, and claiming incidentally to
                    supersede the civil law in virtue of a superior sanctity inherent in those
                    principles.” It is thus different from legal fiction, by which a new rule is
                    introduced surreptitiously, and under the pretence that no change has been made
                    in the law, and from statutory legislation, in which the obligatory force of the
                    rule is not supposed to depend upon its intrinsic fitness. The source of Roman
                    equity was the fertile theory of natural law, or the law common to all nations.
                    Even in the Institutes of Justinian the distinction is carefully drawn in the
                    laws of a country between those which are peculiar to itself and those which <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0530-0511"/> natural reason appoints for all mankind. The
                    connexion in Roman law between the ideas of equity, nature, natural law, and the
                    law common to all nations, and the influence of the Stoical philosophy on their
                    development, are fully discussed in the third chapter of the work we have
                    referred to. The agency by which these principles were introduced was the edicts
                    of the praetor, an annual proclamation setting forth the manner in which the
                    magistrate intended to administer the law during hie year of office. Each
                    successive praetor adopted the edict of his predecessor, and added new equitable
                    rules of his own, until the further growth of the irregular code was stopped by
                    the Praetor Salvius Julianus in the reign of Hadrian.</p>
                <p>The place of the praetor was occupied in English jurisprudence by the lord high
                    chancellor. The real beginning of English equity is to be found in the custom of
                    handing over to that officer, for adjudication, the complaints which were
                    addressed to the king, praying for remedies beyond the reach of the common law.
                    Over and above the authority delegated to the ordinary councils or courts, a
                    reserve of judicial power was believed to reside in the king, which was invoked
                    as of grace by the suitors who could not obtain relief from any inferior
                    tribunal. To the chancellor, as already the head of the judicial system, these
                    petitions were referred, although he was not at first the only officer through
                    whom the prerogative of grace was administered. In the reign of Edward III. the
                    equitable jurisdiction of the court appears to have been established. For some
                    account of this tribunal see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chancery</hi> and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Chancellor.</hi> Its constitutional origin was analogous to
                    that of the Star Chamber and the Court of Requests. The latter, in fact, was a
                    minor court of equity attached to the lord privy seal as the Court of Chancery
                    was to the chancellor. The successful assumption of extraordinary or equitable
                    jurisdiction by the chancellor caused similar pretensions to be made by other
                    officers and courts. “Not only the Court of Exchequer, whose functions were in a
                    peculiar manner connected with royal authority, but the counties palatine of
                    Chester, Lancaster, and Durham, the Court of Great Session in Wales, the
                    universities, the city of London, the Cinque Ports, and other places silently
                    assumed extraordinary jurisdiction similar to that exercised in the Court of
                    Chancery.” Even private persons, lords and ladies, affected to establish in
                    their honours courts "of equity.</p>
                <p>English equity has one marked historical peculiarity, viz., that it established
                    itself in a set of independent tribunals which remained in standing contrast to
                    the ordinary courts for many hundred years. In Roman law the judge gave the
                    preference to the equitable rule; in English law the equitable rule was enforced
                    by a distinct set of judges. One cause of this separation was the rigid
                    adherence to precedent on the part of the common law courts. Another was the
                    jealousy prevailing in England against the principles of the Roman law on which
                    English equity to a large extent was founded.</p>
                <p>When a case of prerogative was referred to the chancellor in the reign of Edward
                    III., he was required to grant such remedy as should be consonant to honesty <hi
                        rend="italic">(honestas).</hi> And honesty, conscience, and equity were said
                    to be the fundamental principles of the court. The early chancellors were
                    ecclesiastics, and under their influence not only moral principles, where these
                    were not regarded by the common law, but also the equitable principles of the
                    Roman law were introduced into English jurisprudence. Between this point and the
                    time when equity became settled as a portion of the legal system, having fixed
                    principles of its own, various views of its nature seem to have prevailed. For a
                    long time it was thought that precedents could have no place in equity, inasmuch
                    as it professed in each case to do that which was just; and we find this view
                    maintained by common lawyers after it had been abandoned by the professors of
                    equity themselves. Mr Spence, in his book on the <hi rend="italic">Equitable
                        Jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery,</hi> quotes a case in the reign of
                    Charles IL, in which Chief-Justice Vaughan said :—</p>
                <p>“I wonder to hear of citing of precedents in matter of equity, for if there be
                    equity in a case, that equity is an universal truth, and there can be no
                    precedent in it; so that in any precedent that can be produced, if it be the
                    same with this case, the reason and equity is the same in itself; and if the
                    precedent be not the same case with this, it is not to be cited. ’</p>
                <p>But the Lord Keeper Bridgman answered :—</p>
                <p>“Certainly precedents are very necessary and useful to us, for in them we may
                    find the reasons of the equity to guide us, and besides rhe authority of those
                    who made them is much to be regarded. We shall suppose they did it upon great
                    consideration and weighing of the matter, and it would be very strange and very
                    ill if we should disturb and set aside what has been the course for a long
                    series of times and ages.”</p>
                <p>Selden’s description is well-known :—“Equity is a roguish thing. ’Tis all one as
                    if they should make the standard for measure the chancellor’s foot.” Lord
                    Nottingham in 1G76 reconciled the ancient theory and the established practice by
                    saying that the conscience which guided the court was not the natural conscience
                    of the man, but the civil and political conscience of the judge. The same
                    tendency of equity to settle into a system of law is seen in the recognition of
                    its limits— in the fact that it did not attempt in all cases to give a remedy
                    when the rule of the common law was contrary to justice. Cases of hardship,
                    which the early chancellors would certainly have relieved, were passed over by
                    later judges, simply because no precedent could be found for their interference.
                    The point at which the introduction of new principles of equity finally stopped
                    is fixed by Sir Henry Maine in the chancellorship of Lord Eldon, who held that
                    the doctrines of the court ought to be as well settled and made as uniform
                    almost as those of the common law. From that time certainly equity, like common
                    law, has professed to take its principles wholly from recorded decisions and
                    statute law. The view (traceable no doubt to the Aristotelian definition) that
                    equity mitigates the hardships of the law where the law errs through being
                    framed in universals, is to be found in some of the earlier writings. Thus in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Doctor and Strident</hi> it is said—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Law makers take heed, to such things as may often come, and not to eveιy
                    particular case, for they could not though they would; therefore, in some cases
                    it is necessary to leave the words of the law and follow that reason and justice
                    requireth, and to that intent equity is ordained, that is to say, to temper and
                    mitigate the rigour of the law.</p>
                <p>And Lord Ellesmere said—</p>
                <p>“The cause why there is a Chancery is for that men’s actions are so divers and
                    infinite that it is impossible to make any general law which shall aptly meet
                    with every particular act and not fail in some circumstances.’'</p>
                <p>Modern equity, it need hardly be said, does not profess to soften the rigour of
                    the law, or to correct the errors into which it falls by reason of its
                    generality.</p>
                <p>To give any account, even in outline, of the subject matter of equity within the
                    necessary limits of this paper would be impossible. It will be sufficient to say
                    here that the classification generally adopted by text-writers is based upon the
                    relation of equity to the common law, of which some explanation in given above.
                    Thus equitable jurisdiction is said to be exclusive, concurrent, or auxiliary.
                    Equity has <hi rend="italic">exclusive</hi> jurisdiction where it recognizes
                    rights which are unknown to the common law. The most important example is
                    trusts. Equity has <hi rend="italic">concurrent</hi> jurisdiction in cases where
                    the law recognized the right but did not give adequate relief or did not give
                    relief without circuity of action or some similar inconvenience. And equity has
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n531/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0531-0512"/><hi rend="italic">auxiliary</hi> jurisdiction
                    when the machinery of the courts of law wa3 unable to procure the necessary
                    evidence.</p>
                <p>“The evils of this double system of judicature,” says the reportof the late
                    Judicature Commission, “and theconfusion and conflict of jurisdiction to which
                    it has led, have been long known and acknowledged.” A partial attempt to meet
                    the difficulty was made by several Acts of Parliament (passed after the reports
                    of commissions appointed in 1850 and 1851), which enabled courts of law and
                    equity both to exercise certain powers formerly peculiar to one or other of
                    them. A more complete remedy was introduced by the Judicature Act, 1873, which
                    consolidated the courts of law and equity, and ordered that law and equity
                    should be administered concurrently according to the rules contained in the 26th
                    section of the Act. The 25th section lays down certain legal principles in
                    accordance with the general intention, and also declares that “generally in all
                    matters not hereinbefore particularly mentioned, on which there is any conflict
                    or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with
                    reference to the same matter, the rules of equity shall prevail.” <hi
