                    being that of Manuscript Bibles, which were direct translations from the Latin
                    Vulgate, the other that of Printed Bibles, which were, more or less completely,
                    translations from the original Hebrew and Greek of the Old and New
                    Testaments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Manuscript Bible.</hi></p>
                <p>As far back as the English language can be followed, there are traces of the work
                    of English translators of the Scriptures.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There seem indeed to have been copies of a vernacular
                    version in the earlier language of the country, for Gildas writes in the
                    beginning of his history that, when English martyrs gave up their lives for
                    Christianity during the Diocletian persecution in the beginning of the 4th
                    centuτy, “all the copies of the Holj∙ Scriptures which could be found were
                    bunted in the streets.”</p></note> St Aidan, bishop of Lindisfarne in the first
                    half of the 7th century (died 651 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> is said by
                    Bede to have employed those who were about him, laymen as well as clergy, in
                    reading and learning the Scriptures, especially the Psalms; and the laymen of
                    Northumbria were not likely to understand any but their native tongue. A little
                    later Caedmon, a lay monk of Whitby (died 680), whose gifts as a poet had been
                    discovered while he was a cow-herd on the neighbouring downs, composed a
                    metrical version of several parts of the Old and New Testaments from English
                    translations which had been made for him by monks who understood the Latin
                    Vulgate. Rather later still, Eadfrith, bishop of Lindisfarne (died 721), is
                    said, on some authority known to Archbishop Ussher (TTorZs, xii. 282), to have
                    translated most of the books of the Bible; and similar traditions are handed
                    down respecting the Venerable Bede (died 735), Alcuin (died 804), and King
                    Alfred (died 901). The earliest relic of such work that actually remains extant
                    is an English Psalter, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n401/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0401-0382"/> the first fifty Psalms of which are in prose and
                    the rest in verse, which was translated by St Aidhelm, long abbot of Malmesbury,
                    and at his death (709) bishop of Sherborne, and of which a copy is preserved in
                    the National Library at Paris. This Psalter was printed at Oxford, under the
                    editorship of Thorpe, in 1835, and is one of the earliest monuments of the
                    English language.</p>
                <p>Next in date comes a volume known as the Lindisfarne or St Cuthbert’s
                    Evangelistarium. This beautiful volume, which formerly belonged to the dean and
                    chapter of Durham, but is now preserved in the British Museum (Nero D. iv.), was
                    written in Latin by Eadfrith about 680, and illuminated by Ethel wold,
                    afterwards (724-740) bishop of Lindisfarne. At a later date an interlinear
                    English translation was added by Ealdred, probably the monk who afterwards
                    became (957-968) bishop of Chester-le-Street. The Lindisfarne Gospels were
                    edited, with a learned introduction, by Bouterwek in 1857, and also by Stevenson
                    and Waring for the Surtees Society in 1854-65.</p>
                <p>Of a little later date is a similar volume, known as the Rushworth Gospels, which
                    is preserved in the Bodleian Library (Auct. D. 2, 19). This manuscript was
                    originally written in Latin by MacRegol, an Irish scribe, about 820, and the
                    interlinear English version was added about 80 or 100 years afterwards by a
                    scribe named Owen and a priest of Harewood named Faerman. The three later
                    gospels are so nearly identical with those of the Lindisfarne book as to show
                    that the translation contained in the latter represents a publicly circulated
                    version. The Rushworth Gospels have also been printed by the Surtees
                    Society.</p>
                <p>There was in circulation, too, in the 10th century, a translation of the first
                    seven books of the Old Testament, which had been made by Aelfric, who was during
                    the later part of his life (994-1005), archbishop of Canterbury. These seven
                    books were probably, however, part only of a much larger work, for translations
                    of the books of Kings, Esther, Job, Judith, the Maccabees, and of the four
                    gospels, also exist, which are of the same date, and are supposed to be from the
                    same pen. Copies of the Heptateuch exist in the British Museum (Claud. B. iv.),
                    and in the Bodleian Library (Laud 509), a copy of the gospels being preserved in
                    the Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. The Heptateuch was printed by
                    Edward Thwaites in 1698.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above, there are also many copies of the “Anglo-Saxon” Psalter
                    and of the Gospels in the British Museum, in the libraries of Oxford and
                    Cambridge, and elsewhere, some of which are written in between the lines of the
                    Latin, and others of which are, like Aelfric’s Heptateuch, &amp;c., independent
                    works. Such manuscripts are found of as late a date as the end of the 12th
                    century, showing that the more ancient form of the English language was in use
                    long after the Norman Conquest, and even when the transition was far advanced
                    from “Anglo-Saxon” to the mediaeval English of Chaucer. The general character of
                    the older English may be seen by the following specimen, taken from Aelfric’s
                    Heptateuch, the comparison with modern English being made easy by a parallel
                    version :—</p>

                <p>The English which was spoken before the Conquest underwent much change, however,
                    during the reigns of the Norman and Angevin kings; and although the reproduction
                    of the older translations shows that there were some Englishmen who still used
                    their language in its ancient form, yet there can be no doubt that many of the
                    old words had become obsolete by the time of the Plantagenets, and that the
                    vernacular tongue of the country had been so altered by its contact with the
                    French spoken by the upper classes as to make new translations of the Scriptures
                    necessary. Of such new translations Archbishop Cranmer writes in his preface to
                    the authorized version of 1540. The Holy Bible was, he says, “translated and
                    read in the Saxons’ tongue, which at that time was our mother tongue,” many
                    hundred years before the date at which he was writing, “whereof there remaineth
                    yet divers copies, found in old abbeys, of such antique manner of writing and
                    speaking that few men now been able to read and understand them. And when this
                    language waxed old and out of common usage, because folk should not lack the
                    fruit of reading it was again translated into the newer language, whereof yet
                    .also many copies remain, and be daily found.” Sir Thomas More also wrote that
                    “the whole Bible was, long before "Wickliffe’sdays, by virtuous and well-learned
                    men, translated into the English tongue, and by good and godly people with
                    devotion and soberness well and reverently read” (More’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dial.,</hi> iii. 14). Similar evidence is given by Foxe, the martyrologist, who
                    says in his dedication to an edition of the Anglo-Saxon gospels, “If histories
                    be well examined, we shall find both before the Conquest and after, as well
                    before John Wickliffe was born as since, the whole body of the Scriptures by
                    sundry men translated into our country tongue.” But as of the earlier period so
                    of this, there are none but fragmentary remains, the “many copies” which
                    remained when Cranmer wrote in 1540 having doubtless disappeared in the vast and
                    ruthless destruction of libraries which took place within a few years after that
                    date.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bale writes in
                    1549, “I judge this to be true, and utter it with heaviness, that neither the
                    Britons under the Romans and Saxons, nor yet the English people under the Danes
                    and Normans, had ever such damage of their learned monuments as we have seen in
                    our time” (Bale’s Declaration upon Leland’s <hi rend="italic">Journal}.</hi>
                    About that time, among hundreds of other libraries, those of the city of London
                    and of the university of Oxford entirely disappeared, the very book shelves of
                    the latter being sold for firewood.</p></note> There are, however, two English
                    versions of the Psalter still remaining which were made early in the 14th
                    century, together with many abstracts and metrical paraphrases of particular
                    books of the Bible, translations of the epistles and gospels used in divine
                    service, paraphrases of gospel lessons, narratives of the Passion and
                    Resurrection of our Lord, and other means for familiarizing the people with Holy
                    Scripture. It was also the custom of mediaeval preachers and writers to give
                    their own English version of any text which they quoted, not resorting as in
                    later times to a commonly received translation; and a very curious illüstration
                    of this fact is found in the prologue to the Wickliffite Bible, where, of the
                    many quotations made from the Scriptures, none are taken from the English
                    version to which it forms the preface, but all are translated directly from the
                    Vulgate. The same fact is observable in the works of Chaucer and of "Wickliffe
                    himself, neither of them using the Wickliffite version, though their works
                    contain numerous quotations from Scripture translated into English.</p>

                <p>Of the two Psalters mentioned above, the earlier one was translated by William de
                    Schorham, who was vicar of Chart Sutton in Kent in the year 1320. One copy is
                    preserved in the British Museum (Add. MS. 17,376), and two others are in the
                    library of Trinity College, Dublin. The other version was made by Richard Rolle,
                    a chantry priest and hermit of Hampole, near Doncaster (died 1319). Among many
                    works that he wrote was a Latin commentary on the Psalms, and on his being
                    persuaded to re-write this in English, an English version of the Psalms was
                    incorporated with it in the same way as the Latin had been in the original work.
                    “In this werke,” wrote the author—</p>
                <p>“I seke no straunge Ynglys, but lightest and communest, &amp; swilk is moste, lyk
                    unto the Latyne, so that thai yt knawes noght ye Latyne be the Ynglys may com to
                    many Latyne wordis. In ye translation I feloghe the letter als-mekille as I may,
                    and ther I fynd no propre Ynglys, I feloghe ye wit of ye wordis, so that thai
                    that schulen rede it them thar not drede enyng.”</p>
                <p>The commentary of Hampole, as the author is frequently called, was very
                    extensively circulated, and many copies of it exist. It was also printed at
                    Cologne in the year 1536.</p>
                <p>Treading worthily in the footsteps of these and many other worthy predecessors,
                    come the translators of the two noble 14th century versions, which were long
                    regarded as the exclusive work of John Wickliffe, and were thus always
                    associated with his name (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wickliffe).</hi> The first of
                    these two versions was completed about 1384, the year of Wickliffe’s death, and
                    may be distinguished by the names of the principal translators, as Hereford and
                    Wickliffe’s version. The second was completed about 1388, and for the same
                    reason may be called Purvey’s version.</p>
                <p>Wickliffe’s earliest work was of the same nature as that of Rolle, being a
                    commentary on the book of Revelation, which he is supposed to have written in
                    1352. This was followed in 1360 by a commentary on the gospels, consisting
                    chiefly of passages from the fathers translated into English and placed beside
                    an English version of the gospels. It is this translation of the gospels alone
                    which can be certainly identified as the work of Wickliffe in the Bible which
                    goes by his name; but Sir Frederick Madden says, in his preface to the
                    Wickliffite versions, that the Epistles, Acts, and Apocalypse “might probably be
                    the work of Wickliffe himself; at least the similarity of style between the
                    gospels and the other parts favours the supposition.” The Old Testament and
                    Apocryphal books were translated principally by Nicolas de Hereford, of Queen’s
                    College, Oxford, at one time vice-chancellor of the university, and afterwards a
                    canon of Hereford. It is to be observed, however, that the translation of the
                    Psalms in Hereford’s Old Testament is undoubtedly based upon that of the Hampole
                    Psalter. The original manuscript of Hereford’s translation, with his alterations
                    and corrections, is preserved in the Bodleian Library (Bodl. 959). It extends
                    only as far as Baruch iii. 19, and it is supposed that his work was interrupted
                    in the middle of the year 1382 by a summons to appear before convocation in
                    London, and by a subsequent appeal which he made to Rome, and which ended in an
                    imprisonment there. A contemporary copy of his manuscript also exists in the
                    Bodleian (Douce 369), which shows the further growth of this version. At the
                    place where Hereford left off, a note is inserted stating the fact in Latin,
                    “Explicit translationem Nicholay de Herford,” and the remaining books of the Old
                    Testament, Ezekiel, Daniel, the twelve minor prophets, and the two books of
                    Maccabees, are added by another and unknown hand. The Bible was then completed
                    by extracting the text of the gospels from Wickliffe’s commentary, and adding to
                    it a new translation of the rest of the New Testament. Copies of this Bible are
                    rare, far the greater number of the copies of the “Wickliffite Bible” being of
                    the later version, now to be described.</p>
                <p>Although there is enough verbal resemblance between this later version and that
                    of Hereford and Wickliffe to suggest that it is a revision of the latter rather
                    than a new translation, the account given of his work by Purvey himself says
                    nothing about such a revision, and represents it as an independent version.</p>
                <p>“For these reasons and other,” he wrote in his prologue or preface, “with common
                    charity to save all men in our realm which God will have saved, a simple
                    creature hath translated the Bible out of Latin into English. First, this simple
                    creature had much travail, with divers fellows and helpers, to gather many old
                    Bibles, and other doctors, and common glosses, and to make one Isatin Bible some
                    deal true: and then to study it of the new, the text with the gloss and other
                    doctors as he might get, and specially Lyra on the Old Testament that helped him
                    full much in this work: the third time to counsel with old grammarians and old
                    divines of hard words and hard senses how they might best be understood and
                    translated: the fourth time, to translate as clearly as he Could to the sense,
                    and to have many good fellows and cunning at the correcting of the
                    translation.”</p>
                <p>These words imply a labour of somc years, and as Purvey makes no allusion
                    whatever to any other translation of his own time, it is reasonable to suppose
                    that he went to his task without any knowledge that a similar work was being
                    done by contemporaries. But although he says much in his prologue respecting the
                    manner in which his work of translation had been done, Purvey gives no
                    information respecting the date at which he was writing. He lived on as late as
                    the year 1427, leading an unsettled life, and suffering imprisonment for his
                    opinions, which he recanted at St Paul’s Cross in 1400; but it is supposed that
                    his translation was completed by about the year 1388. About 150 copies of
                    Purvey’s version are known to be still in existence, some of them beautifully
                    illuminated and beautifully bound, but they all appear to have been written
                    before 1430.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The earlier
                    and the later of these two “Wickliffite” versions of the Bible were printed in
                    parallel columes in four quarto volumes in 1850, under the editorship of the
                    Rev. Josiah Forshall and Sir Frederic Madden. Previously to that time the New
                    Testament of Purvey had been printed by the Rev. John Lewis, in folio, in 1731,
                    and again by the Rev. H. H. Baber, in quarto, in 1810; it was also printed in
                    Bagster’s English <hi rend="italic">Hexapla,</hi> in 1841. Of the earlier
                    version the Song of Solomon was printed, and many detached portions of other
                    books, in Dr Adam Clarke’s <hi rend="italic">Commcn tary</hi> in 1810, and the
                    New Testament by Mr Lea Wilson in 1848.</p></note></p>
                <p>The following specimen of the later version (John xi. 1-13) will show that its
                    language is not very far removed from that of the present day :—</p>
                <p>“And ther was a sijk man, Lazarus of Bethanye, of the castel of Marie and Martha
                    lιise sistris. And it was Marye, which anoyntidβ the Lord with oynement, and
                    wipte hise feet with hir heeris, whos brother Lazarus was sijk. Therefor hise
                    sistris senten to hym, and seide, Lord, lo! he whom thou louest is sijk. And
                    Jhesus herde, and seide to hem, This syknesse is not to the deth, but for the
                    glorie of God, that mannus sone be glorified bi him. And Jhesus louyde Martha
                    ajιd hir sistir Marie, and Lazaros. Therfor whanne Jhesus herde that he was
                    sijk, thanne he dwellide in the same place twei daies. And after these thingis
                    he seide to hise disciplis, Go we eft in to Judee. The disciplis seien to hvm,
                    Maister, now the Jewis soughten for to stoone thee, and eft goist thou thidir?
                    Jhesus answerde, whether ther ben not twelue ouris of the dai? If ony man wandre
                    in the dai he hirtith not, for he seeth the light of this world. But if he
                    wandre in the night, he stomblith, for light is not in him. He seith these
                    thingis, and aftir these thingis he seith to hem Lazarus oure freend, slepith,
                    but Y go to reise hym fro sleep. Therfor hise disciplis seiden: Lord, if he
                    slepith, he schal be saaf. But Jhesus hadde seid of his deth; but thei gessiden
                    that he seide of slepyng of sleep. Thaune therfor Jhesus seide to hem opynli,
                    Lazarus is dead; and Y haue ioye for you, that ye bileue, for Y was not there;
                    but go we to hym.”</p>
                <p>This was the latest English dress in which the Holy Bible appeared during those
                    seven centuries or more in which it was a reproduction of the Latin Vulgate, and
                    before the invention of printing was brought to bear on the circulation of the
                    Scriptures.</p>

                <p>It is singular that while France, Spain, and Italy each possessed vernacular
                    Bibles before Henry VΠL began his reign, and Germany had seventeen editions of
                    the Scriptures printed and widely circulated in the German language before
                    Luther was known, yet no English printer attempted to put the familiar English
                    Bible into type. No part of the Bible was printed in English before 1526, no
                    complete Bible before 1535, and none in England before 1538.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It should be mentioned,
                    however, that the popular <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi> contained nearly
                    the whole of the Pentateuch and the Gospel narrative in English, and that this
                    was printed by Caxton in 1493.</p></note></p>
                <p>The first-fruits of the printing press as regards the English Bible were the New
                    Testament and the Pentateuch of William Tyndale (1484-1536), which were
                    translated and printed abroad between the years 1524 and 1530. Dernaus, in his
                    life of Tyndale, gives reasons for coming to the conclusion that he first formed
                    the intention of translating the Bible “about the end of 1522 or beginning of
                    1523” (Demaus’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Tyndale,</hi> p. 63, n.), at which
                    time he was engaged, as a clergyman of the mature age of thirty-eight, in
                    teaching the children of Sir John Walsh of Little Sodbury, in Gloucestershire,
                    the eldest of whom was only six or seven years of age <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.</hi> p. 37). Early in 1523 he left Sodbury and went up to London, where
                    he was engaged for six months as chantry priest to the family of Humphrey
                    Monmouth, a city merchant, whose residence was near the Tower. About the end of
                    1523 Tyndale endeavoured to obtain a home in the household of the learned
                    Tunstall, then bishop of London, it being the custom for bishops of those days
                    to surround themsejves with a small court of scholars, chaplains, and
                    assistants, who were maintained out of the revenues of their sees. The bishop
                    was already overburdened, however, with dependents, and though Tyndale carried a
                    translation of an oration of Isocrates in his hand as evidence of his Greek
                    scholarship, he said nothing about his contemplated translation of the New
                    Testament; and being, as he says, “evil-favυured in this world, and without
                    grace in the sight of men, speechless and rude, dull and slow-witted,” it is no
                    wonder that the bishop recommended him kindly “to seek in London, where he said
                    I could not lack a service,” such as that in which he had already been engaged.
                    Thus it happened that Tyndale left England and went to Germany early in the year
                    1524, an unknown, an unsuccessful, and a disappointed man, and yet one whose
                    work during the next two years was to be honoured by every succeeding generation
                    of his countrymen, and to give his name a conspicuous place among those of the
                    Reformers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tyndale).</hi></p>
                <p>The six months which Tyndale had spent in Monmouth’s house were probably occupied
                    in preparing himself for his greater undertaking by the translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi> of Erasmus, and “another little treatise,” which
                    he left in charge of the merchant. On landing at Hamburg he “got him straight to
                    Luther” at Wittenberg, according to the unanimous testimony of his
                    contemporaries, and there the work of translation must have been commenced
                    immediately; for notwithstanding a long journey by land to Cologne, a
                    sufficiently long residence there for the printing of St Matthew and St Mark in
                    one edition, a removal to Worms and the time occupied there in printing another
                    edition of the whole New Testament, the translation was widely circulated in
                    England within less than two years of Tyndale’s arrival in Germany. Whether he
                    was in any way assisted by Luther is still a disputed point, as, although
                    Tyndale translated and adapted Luther’s prefaces to the several books, and also
                    many of his marginal annotations or “glosses,” this does not necessarily
                    indicate any personal influence of the great Reformer, and there is no
                    historical evidence to show that there was any intercourse between them. What is
                    more certain is that Tyndale was assisted by a Franciscan friar named William
                    Roye, and by “a faithful companion” whose name he does not give, “till that was
                    ended which I could not do alone without one both to write and to help me to
                    compare the texts together.” When the work of translation was sufficiently
                    advanced, or when it was completed, Tyndale and Roye removed to Cologne, where
                    it was put to press by Peter Quentel, that printer being chosen perhaps of all
                    in Germany because his partners the Byrckmans were booksellers in Loudon, and
                    would thus be able to set the book in circulation. The printers began an
                    impression of 3000 in a small quarto size, but the printing had only proceeded
                    as far as the tenth sheet, when any further progress was prohibited by the
                    authorities of the city, Tyndale and Roye being considered as “two English
                    apostates who had been some time at Wittenberg,” and whose work could not but
                    therefore be an evil one. The two Englishmen managed, however, to escape higher
                    up the Rhine to Worms, where Luther’s influence was much stronger than at
                    Cologne, and they succeeded in carrying with them some, or all, of the 20,000 or
                    30,000 sheets which had been printed. Instead of completing Quentel’s work,
                    Peter Schoeffer the Worms printer was employed to print another impression of
                    3000 in a small octavo size, without prefaces to the books or annotations in the
                    margin, and only having an address “To the Reder” at the end in addition to the
                    New Testament text itself. Both impressions arrived in England early in the
                    summer of 1526, less than two years after Tyndale had quitted its shores, and
                    were put into circulation with more or less secrecy as opportunity offered. The
                    imperfect or quarto impression printed at Cologne is sometimes spoken of by
                    contemporaries as “Matthew and Mark in English” or “the chapters of Matthew;”
                    and Dr Robert Ridley, uncle to Bishop Ridley, writes of “the common and vulgar
                    translation of the New Testament into English, done by Mr William Hichyns
                    otherwise called Mr W. Tyndale, and friar William Roye,” distinguishing the two
                    impressions by mentioning “their commentaries and annotations in Matthew and
                    Mark iu the first print, as well as their preface,” or address to the reader,
                    “in the second print” (Demaus’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Tyndale,</hi> p. 105).
                    But both these impressions are now so rare that of the first only sixty-two
                    pages of one copy are known (Brit. Mus., <hi rend="italic">Grenv.</hi> 12,179),
                    and of the second only one imperfect copy, which is in the library of St Paul’s
                    Cathedral, and one perfect copy which is in that of the Baptist college at
                    Bristol. Tyndale’s work was, however, reprinted surreptitiously at Antwerp three
                    times before 1528, and again under the editorship of George Joye,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Joye was a rival translator,
                    and although he and Tyndale had.once been friends, they afterwards wrote against
                    each other in exceedingly bitter language. Joye published an English Psalter at
                    Strasburg in 1530, a translation of Isaiah in 1531, and one of Jeremiah in 1534.
                    Tyndale says that he had printed two leaves of a translation of Genesis and sent
                    copies of it to the king and queen, with a request that he might receive licence
                    to go through the whole Bible. But although he survived until 1553, Joye’s name
                    does not appear again in association with the work of translation.</p></note>
                    one of his former friends, in August 1534. In November 1534 Tyndale himself
                    brought out a revised edition, with translations added of all the Sarum Epistles
                    and Gospels which were taken from the Old Testament and the Apocryphal books,
                    this edition being also printed at Antwerp by Martin Emperour. In the following
                    year Tyndale once more set forth a revised edition, “fynesshed in the yere of
                    oure Lorde God <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.d.</hi> and xxxv.;” and this is supposed
                    to have been revised by him while in prison in the castle of Vilvorde, being the
                    last of his labours in connection with the English Bible. His execution took
                    place on October 6, 1536, and about the same time a small folio reprint of his
                    revised edition of 1534 was brought out in <pb break="no"

                <p>Three years and a half after the publication of his English New Testament, on
                    January 17, 1530, Tyndale published his English Pentateuch. That he did not know
                    anything of Hebrew when he left England in 1524 seems certain (Eadie’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Eng. Bible,</hi> i. 208), while translation of the New Testament
                    and seeing it through the press in less than two years could scarcely have left
                    him time for acquiring a knowledge of it before 1526. In May 1528 he published
                    two works, <hi rend="italic">The Parable of the Wicked Mammon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Obedience of a Christian Man,</hi> and was at the same time
                    engaged in writing <hi rend="italic">The Practice of Prelates,</hi> a work of
                    considerable size. Between the middle of 1526 and the middle of 1529 it was
                    impossible for any man so fully employed to learn Hebrew so thoroughly as to be
                    able to produce at the end of that time an original translation of the
                    Pentateuch, aud the opinion that Tyndale did so cannot be maintained in the face
                    of such historical facts. Frith, who joined him at Marburg in 1528, may have
                    been a Hebrew scholar, and from him Tyndale may have received assistance in the
                    work. But Foxestates that when Tyndale had completed his translation, he was
                    shipwrecked on the coast of Holland, losing it and all his books, that he sailed
                    by another ship to Hamburg, and that there Coverdale “helped him in the
                    translating of the whole five books of Moses, from Easter till December, in the
                    house of a worshipful widow, Mistress Margaret Van Emmerson, 1529 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> a great sweating sickness being at the same time in
                    the town. So having despatched his business at Hamburg he returned afterwards to
                    Antwerp again.” (Foxe’s <hi rend="italic">Acts and</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mon.,</hi><hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 120, ed. 1846.) But there is so much in
                    common between the language of Tyndale’s Pentateuch and that of his predecessor
                    Purvey, that it is evident the old English Bible, already so familiar to
                    Englishmen, was made the foundation of the new work. Tyndale himself may have
                    had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to have corrected some of the more glaring
                    errors of the Wickliffite version, especially by the help of Luther’s German
                    Bible; or he may, as Foxe alleges, have been assisted by Coverdale, who had a
                    competent acquaintance with the language. However this may have been, the
                    English Pentateuch was so rapidly placed in the printer’s hands, notwithstanding
                    Tyndale’s other literary occupations, that it came from the press with the
                    colophon “Emprented at Marlborow, in the land of Hesse, by me, Hans Luft, the
                    yere of oure Lorde <hi rend="smallcaps">mcccccxxx.,</hi> the xvii. daye of
                    January,” and was shortly afterwards put in circulation in England. Of this work
                    several copies are still in existence, but the only perfect one known is in the
                    British Museum. In the following year Tyndale published a translation of Jonah,
                    the only copy known of which is in the library of the marquis of Bristol at
                    Ixworth; and in 1534 he brought out a revised edition of the book of Genesis,
                    which was the last of his labours in connection with the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile a complete English Bible was being pre pared by Miles Coverdale
                    (1485-1565), an Augustinian friar who was afterwards for a few years (1551-1555)
                    bishop of Exeter. As the printing of the whole Bible must have occupied the
                    printers for many months, and probably did occupy them for several years, and as
                    that printing was finished on October 4, 1535, it is evident that Coverdale must
                    have been engaged on the preparation of the work for the press at almost as
                    early a date as Tyndale. There is, indeed, a correspondence extant between
                    Cromwell when •he was secretary to Wolsey and Coverdale when he was resident at
                    the Augustinian priory at Cambridge, which shows that the work was in hand in
                    the year 1527. But the book was printed abroad, and Foxe’s statement shows that
                    Coverdale was at Antwerp in 1529, so that probably the greater part of the
                    translation was made, like that of Tyndale, out of England. Mr Henry Stevens has
                    pointed out that, in a biographical notice of Emanuel Van Meteren appended to
                    his history of Belgium by Simon Ruytinck, the latter states that Jacob Van
                    Meteren, the father of Emanuel, had manifested great zeal in producing at
                    Antwerp a translation of the Bible into English “for the advancement of the
                    kingdom of Christ in England, and for this purpose he employed a certain learned
                    scholar named Miles Coverdale.” As Van Meteren had been taught the art of
                    printing in his youth, it seems very probable that he exercised his zeal in the
                    matter by undertaking the cost of printing the work as well as that of
                    remunerating the translator. The woodcuts in Coverdale’s Bible, but not the
                    type, have been traced up to James Nicolson, printer in St Thomas’ Hospital in
                    1535, and Mr Stevens connects him with the book and with Van Meteren in the
                    following manner: “The London bookbinders and stationers, finding the market
                    filled with foreign books, especially Testaments, made complaint in 1533-34, and
                    petitioned for relief; in consequence of which a statute was passed compelling
                    foreigners to sell their editions entire to some London stationer, in sheets, so
                    that the binders might not suffer. This new law was to come into operation about
                    the beginning of 1535. In consequence of this law, Jacob Van Meteren, as his
                    Bible approached completion, was obliged to come to London to sell the edition.
                    We have reason to believe that he sold it to James Nicolson of Southwark, who
                    not only bought the entire edition, but the woodcuts, and probably the punches
                    and type; but if the latter, they were doubtless lost in transmission, as they
                    have never turned up in any shape since. All the copies of the Coverdale Bible
                    in the original condition, as far as we know, have appeared in English binding,
                    thus confirming this law of 1534.” <hi rend="italic">{Carton Celebr.
                    Catal.,</hi> pp. 88, 89.) It is now evident that Coverdale refers partly, at
                    least, to Jacob Van Meteren when he says in his dedication: “Trusting in His
                    infinite goodness that He would bring my simple and rude labour herein to good
                    effect, therefore, as the Holy Ghost moved other men to do the cost hereof, so
                    was I boldened in God to labour in the same.” But although the discovery of
                    Ruytinck’s statement seems to show conclusively that Coverdale completed his
                    translation, after Wolsey’s fall, at the cost of Van Meteren, and at Antwerp
                    instead of Cambridge, he so far picked up the semi-official clue which he had
                    dropped for a time that he published it with a dedication to King Henry VIII.,
                    which occupies five pages, and is subscribed “youre Grace’s humble subiecte and
                    daylye oratour, Myles Coverdale.”</p>
                <p>This first of all printed English Bibles is a small folio volume measuring 11£ by
                    8 inches, and bears the title— “Biblia. The Bible, that is, the Holy Scripture
                    of the Olde and New Testament, faithfully and truly translated out of Douche and
                    Latyn in to Englysh,e, <hi rend="smallcaps">m.d.xxxv.,”</hi> with the texts 2
                    Thes. iii. 1, Col. iii. 16, Josh. i. 8 underneath. The colophon is “Prynted in
                    the yeare of our Lord M.D. XXXV., and fynished the fourth daye of October.” The
                    title page was, however, for some reason cancelled immediately, and only one
                    perfect copy of it is known. The new title page with the same date, 1535, merely
                    says, “fayth-fully translated in to Englyshe,” omitting the words “and truly”
                    and “out of Douche and Latyn.” A second edition in folio, “newly oversene and
                    corrected,” was printed by Nicolson, with English type, in 1537; and also, in
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0405-0386"/> same year, a third edition in quarto. On the
                    title-page of the latter were added the words, “set forth with the Kynge’s moost
                    gracious licence.”</p>
                <p>The words at first printed on the title-page, and subsequently cancelled, had
                    been doubtless placed there by mistake. In his dedication to the king, Coverdale
                    says, “I have with a clear conscience purely and faithfully translated this out
                    of five sundry interpreters, having only the manifest truth of the Scriptures
                    before mine eyes.” These “five interpreters” would naturally be Bibles in
                    Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German, and English,—the English being that with which
                    Coverdale must long have been familiar, the Wickliffite version, together with
                    the recent translations of Tyndale.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The above conclusion is not at all contradicted by
                    Coverdale’s statement in his address to the reader, that “To help me therein I
                    have had sundry translations, not only in Latin, but also of the Dutch”—or
                    German—“interpreters, whom, because of their singular gifts and special
                    diligence in the Bible, I have been the more glad to follow for the most part,
                    according as I was required.” He thinks it quite unnecessary to say that he
                    translated directly from the Hebrew and Greek, but adds, that he was far from
                    rejecting all help and guidance as to the meaning of Hebrew and Greek words,
                    gladly and humbly looking to see how others had interpreted the words into Latin
                    and German.</p></note></p>
                <p>It should be added that Coverdale’s Bible was the first in which the
                    non-canonical books were collected out of the body of the Old Testament and
                    placed by themselves at the end of it under a separate title. Coverdale entitled
                    them “The Volume of the Book called Hagiographa,” but this was changed to
                    “Apocrypha” in the Great Bible of 1549.</p>
                <p>The large sale of the New Testaments of Tyndale, and the success of Coverdale’s
                    Bible, showed the London booksellers that a new and profitable branch of
                    business was opened out to them, and they soon began to avail themselves of its
                    advantages. Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch, afterwards the king’s
                    printers, were the first in the field, bringing out a fine and full-sized fδlio
                    in 1537, the same year in which Coverdale’s second edition appeared, “truely and
                    purely translated into English by Thomas Matthew.” This volume was prepared for
                    the press at Antwerp by “John Rogers <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Matthew,” who
                    was for some time (1534-1548) chaplain to the Merchant Adventurers there, whose
                    wife, Adriana Pratt, was a relative of Jacob Van Meteren, and who returning to
                    England in 1548 became canon of St Paul’s, and was the first of the sufferers at
                    Smithfield in the reign of Queen Mary. It was not, however, “translated by
                    Thomas Matthew,”</p>
                <p>but was a compilation from the translations of Tyndale and Coverdale, made under
                    the editorship of Rogers, who revised them to some extent before sending them to
                    press. The Pentateuch was printed from Tyndale’s translation of 1531; and the
                    books from Joshua to the end of Chronicles are said to have been translated by
                    Tyndale also—a tradition corroborated by internal evidence (Westcott’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Eny. Bible,</hi> p. 224)—and to have been left by him in the hands
                    of Rogers. From Ezra to Malachi the translation is taken from Coverdale, as is
                    also that of the Apocryphal books. The New Testament is a revised copy of
                    Tyndale’s edition of 1535. Thus, as the book consists of 1100 pages, more than
                    half, or 600 pages, must be assigned to Tyndale, and the remaining 500 pages to
                    Coverdale.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the Matthew Bible was printed by Antwerp booksellers as a
                    speculation, in the same manner as the New Testament had been brought out under
                    the editorship of Joye by the “widowe of Christoffel of End-hoven,” in 1534. But
                    while it was at the press, Grafton and Whitchurch appear to have stepped in with
                    an offer to purchase the work, their initials being found on a title-page which
                    is placed before the prophecy of Isaiah. This view is confirmed by the fact that
                    in the following year, 1538, there was “Imprynted at Antwerpe by Matthew Crom” a
                    New Testament in which the text of Coverdale was used, with the prologues of
                    Tyndale,—a concordance, some annotations, and nearly 200 woodcuts being added by
                    the enterprising printer. In whatever way the Matthew Bible originated, the
                    edition of 1500 copies was purchased by Grafton for the sum of £500, equal to
                    about £6000 of modern money; and, having obtained leave to place on the
                    title-page “Set forth with the King <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> s most
                    gracyous licence,” he and his partner published it in the summer of 1537.</p>
                <p>Grafton was afraid that rivals would step in and deprive him of the profits which
                    he expected. He therefore entreated Secretary Cromwell that the sale of his
                    Bible might be expedited by compelling every abbey to take six copies. He also
                    complained that there were “Dutchmen dwelling within the realm, who can neither
                    speak good English, nor write none, w ho yet will both print and correct such an
                    edition, and who are so covetous that they will not bestow twenty or forty
                    pounds on a learned man as editor.” Perhaps the rival edition which he really
                    feared may have been one which was published in 1539 by “John Byddell for Thomas
                    Barthlet,” with Richard Taverner, “a learned man, as editor.” This was, in fact,
                    what would now be called a “piracy,” being Grafton’s “Matthew Bible” revised by
                    Taverner, a learned member of the Inner Temple, who had been one of Wolsey’s
                    students at Christ Church, and although a layman, had occasionally preached from
                    the university pulpit. Taverner made many alterations in the Matthew Bible, and
                    the rapidity with which he edited the work indicates that he must have used a
                    Bible already annotated by himself as the basis of bis labours.<note

                    not uncommon; one is now before the writer which is full of Hebrew, Greek, and
                    Latin notes.</p></note> Taverner’s Bible was printed in folio with “Cum
                    privilegio ad imprimendum solum” on the title-page, and it was at the same time
                    printed in quarto. In the same year folio and quarto editions of the New
                    Testament alone were published, and in the following year, 1540, the New
                    Testament in duodecimo. The Old Testament was reprinted as part of a Bible of
                    1551, but no other editions are known than those named.</p>
                <p>It will have been observed that the translations of Holy Scripture which had been
                    printed during these fourteen years (1526-1539) were all made by private men and
                    printed without any public authority. Some of them had indeed been set forth by
                    the king’s licence, but the object of this is shown by a letter of Archbishop
                    Cranmer to Secretary Cromwell, requesting that it might be given to Matthew’s
                    Bible. It is “that the same may be sold and read of every person, without danger
                    of any act, proclamation, or ordinance heretofore granted to the contrary, until
                    such time that we, the bishops, shall set forth abetter translation, which I
                    think will not be till a day after doomsday.” This letter was written on August
                    4, 1537, and the impatient words at the end refer to an authorized version which
                    had been projected several years before, and which was, in fact, at that very
                    time in preparation, though not proceeding quickly enough to satisfy
                    Cranmer.</p>
                <p>In the year 1530 Henry VIII. issued a commission of inquiry respecting the
                    expediency and necessity of having “in the English tongue both the New Testament
                    and the Old,” the commission consisting of Sir Thoma? More, the two archbishops,
                    and the bishop of London, together with seventeen other “discreet and
                    well-learned personages” taken from the two universities and “other parts of his
                    realm,” whose names are recorded, together “with many more learned men of the
                    said universities in great numbe assembled then and there together” (Wilkins’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Cone., iii-</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n406/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0406-0387"/> 737). This commission, which included Hugh and
                    William Latimer among its members, reported against the expediency of setting
                    forth a vernacular translation until there was amore settled state of religious
                    opinion, but states that the king “intended to provide that the Holy Scripture
                    shall be, by great, learned, and Catholic persons, translated into the English
                    tongue if it shall then seem 'to His Grace convenient to be” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.</hi> 740). The convocation of Canterbury refreshed the royal memory on
                    the subject by petitioning the king on December 19, 1534, “that His Majesty
                    would vouchsafe to decree, that the Scriptures should be translated iuto the
                    vulgar tongue by some honest and learned men, to be nominated by the king, and
                    to be delivered to the people according to their learning” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.</hi> 770). It was doubtless in response to this petition that the
                    measures were taken of which a very slight historical record remains in some
                    note3 of Ralph Morrice, Cranmer’s secretary. “First,” he says, the archbishop
                    “began with the translation of the New Testament, taking an old English
                    translation thereof,” —the Wickliffite probably, for Tyndale’s was only eight
                    years old,—“which he divided into nine or ten parts, causing each part to be
                    written at large in a paper book, and then to be sent to the best learned
                    bishops and others, to the intent that they should make a perfect correction
                    thereof. And when they had done, he required them to send back their parts so
                    corrected unto him at Lambeth, by a day limited for that purpose; and the same
                    course, no question, he took with the Old Testament.” (Camd. Soc. <hi
                    rend="italic">Marr. of Ref,</hi> p. 277.) A letter from Bishop Gardiner to
                    Cromwell is preserved among the state papers, dated June 10, 1535, in which the
                    former writes that he had translated St Luke and St John for his portion of the
                    work, and that he had expended great labour upon them; and of the rest, with the
                    exception of Stυkesley, bishop of London,“when the day came,” says Morrice,
                    “every man sent to Lambeth their parts corrected.’’ Some further steps of
                    revision and preparation for the press would no doubt be taken, and the subject
                    was again before convocation in 1536 (Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">Ref,</hi> i.
                    314; Pococke’s ed. 1865); but, as in the case of later revisions of the Bible,
                    the detailed history is lost to us,—all that is known further relating to the
                    printing.</p>
                <p>For reasons not now known, it was determined that this authorized version should
                    be printed by Francis Régnault, the Paris printer, who provided most of the
                    service-books that were used in England. At the request of Henry VIII., “noster
                    carissimus frater,” a licence was granted to Régnault for this purpose by
                    Francis the French king, while Coverdale and Grafton were sent over in 1537, the
                    one as a learned editor the other as a practical printer, to superintend the
                    work as it passed through the press. Portions of the printed sheets were sent
                    home by Bonner who was then ambassador at the court of Paris, as ambassador’s
                    baggage, and were thus conveyed out of France free from any difficulties with
                    the French authorities; but when the printing was far advanced, on December 17,
                    1538, its further progress was interdicted by the inquisitor-general, and 0rder3
                    were given to seize the whole of the impression. Coverdale and Grafton left
                    Paris quickly, leaving a great number of finished sheets, which were condemned
                    to be burned in the Place Maubert; but, through the connivance of the officer
                    appointed to see this done, the whole of them were βold to a haberdasher as
                    waste paper, and “four great dry vats’’ full of them sent over to England. As
                    the licence to print them had been given at the special request of Henry VIII.,
                    it is probable that the escape of the men and the books was facilitated by the
                    civil authorities to prevent any unpleasantness with the English king. A short
                    time afterwards the types, printing press, and workmen followed the printed
                    sheets, and the volume which had been begun in Paris in 1537 was completed in
                    London, the colophon stating that it was “Fynisshed in Apryll, Anno <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> ccccc. XXXIX. It is a splendid folio “Bible of the
                    largest volume,” and was distinguished from its predecessors by the name of “The
                    Great Bible.” The title-page describes it as “The Byble in Englysħe, that is to
                    saye, the content of all the Holy Scripture, bothe of the Olde and Newe
                    Testament, truly translated after the veryte of the Hebreue and Greke texts by
                    ye dylygent studye of dyverse excellent learned men, expert in the forsayde
                    tongues. Prynted by Rychard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch. Cum privilegio ad
                    imprimendum solum, 1539.” This was the first of seven editions of this noble
                    Bible which issued from the press during the years 1539-41,—the second of them,
                    that of 1540, having the important addition “This is the Byble apoynted to the
                    vse of the churches” on the title-page. Seventy years afterwards it assumed, the
                    form ever since known as the “Authorized Version, ’ but its Psalter is still
                    embedded, without any alteration, in the Bo(k of Common Prayer.</p>
                <p>The “Great Bible” was, however, a dignitary among books, its size and its price
                    (about £6 of modern money) making it comparatively inaccessible as a home volume
                    for private use. The demand for the vernacular Scriptures which the supply of
                    them had caused was at the same time so enormous that before the end of Edward
                    VI.’s reign 26 editions of folio and quarto Bibles, and about double that number
                    of editions of New Testaments, had .been printed. This demand for household
                    Bibles was effectually and unexpectedly met by one on the production of which
                    the English refugees were engaged at Geneva during the last year of Queen Mary’s
                    reign and the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and which became the
                    household Bible of the English middle classes for at least two generations. The
                    Geneva Bible was not an original translation, but a revision of the Great Bible
                    by Hebrew and Greek scholars, who were quite competent to compare the English
                    translation with the original. It was begun in 1558 when Coverdale was at
                    Geneva, and his ample experience was no doubt enlisted in the work; but after
                    his return to England in the middle of 1559, the responsible editors were
                    William Whittingham, afterwards lay dean of Durham, Anthony Gilby, afterwards
                    for a short time dean of Christ Church and then prebendary of St Paul’s, and
                    Thomas Sampson, afterwards dean of Christ Church. The revision was carried on
                    with such industry that the printing of the Bible was finished in April 1560. It
                    became popular immediately on account of its handy size, usually that of a small
                    quarto, and of its being printed in a readable Roman type instead of black
                    letter. It also contained a marginal commentary, which proved a great attraction
                    to the Puritans; and, above all, an improvement which Whittingham had already
                    introduced into an independent English New Testament which he had published in
                    1557 was also introduced into the Bible of 1560, that of dividing the chapters
                    inio verses. Like all Bibles hitherto printed, and nearly all that were printed
                    until the latter part of the 17th century, the Geneva Bible contained the
                    Apocrypha, but copies are occasionally found from which it was omitted by the
                    binder.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Geneva Bible
                    has often been called the “Breeches” Bible from the translation of Gen iii. 7,
                    “They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves breeches,” But this had been
                    familiar long before, in Caxton’s <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi> and in
                    the Wickliffite Bible. An edition of Matthew’s Bible, printed in 1551, is
                    similarly called the “Bug” Bible, from the reading in Ps. xci. 5, “So that thou
                    shalt not nede to be afrayed for any bugges by night;” but Coverdale’s and
                    Taverner’s Bibles use the same word, equivalent to the modern “bogie.’’ A Bible
                    of 1631 has been called the “Wicked Bible,” because the important little word
                    “not” is left out of the Seventh Commandment, an accident which also happened in
                    a German Bible of the last century; and another almost as wicked a volume is a
                    small pearl Bible of 1653, in which St Paid is made to ask “Know ye not that the
                    um·ighteous shall inherit the Kingdom of God ?”</p></note> The popularity of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0407-0388"/> this Bible was so great that about 200 editions
                    of it in various sizes from folio downward were published, often with the Prayer
                    Book and metrical Psalms appended; and it gave way very slowly even before the
                    present Authorized Version, which is much superior to it. The first Bible
                    printed in Scotland was a folio reprint of the Geneva version, “Printed in
                    Edinburgh By Alexander Arbuthnot, Printer to the Kinge’s Maiestie, dwelling at
                    ve Kirk of feild, 1579.”</p>
                <p>Soon after the accession of Queen Elizabeth, when the demand for Bibles was again
                    pressing upon the printers, Archbishop Parker organized a revision of the Great
                    Bible of 1539 by “able bishops and other learned men.” The work was undertaken
                    by the archbishop himself, eleven other bishops, and four deans and
                    prebendaries, in 1563, the plan of distributing it being precisely the same as
                    that adopted by Archbishop Cranmer. The rules upon which they proceeded were
                    these :—</p>
                <p>“1. To follow the common English translation used in the churches, and not to
                    recede from it, but where it varieth manifestly from the Hebrew or Greek
                    original. 2. To use sections and divisions in the text as Pagnine in his
                    translation useth, and for the verity of the Hebrew to follow the said Pagnine
                    and Munster specially, and generally others learned in the tongues. 3. To make
                    no bitter notes upon any text, or yet to set down any determination in places of
                    controversy. 4. To note such chapters and places as contain matters of
                    genealogies, or other such places not edifying, with some strike or note, that
                    the reader may eschew them in his public reading, 5. That all such words as
                    sound in the old translation to any offence of lightness or obscenity be
                    expressed with more convenient terms and phrases.”</p>
                <p>Much labour was expended upon this revision, but the printing was completed, and
                    the volume, a large folio, was ready for publication on October 5, 1568. Several
                    editions of it were afterwards published, but it may be doubted whether it was
                    ever cordially received. The Great Bible of 1539 was used in many churches, and
                    the Geneva Bible was in almost every house; and although the 80th Canon of 1603
                    enjoins that the Bishops’ Bible shall be the only one used in churches, it was
                    never reprinted after 1606. A quarto edition was brought out in 1569, and the
                    New Testament was several times printed separately.</p>
                <p>The English Bible which is now recognized as the “Authorized Version,” wherever
                    the English language is spoken, is a revision of the Bishops’ Bible, begun in
                    1604 and published in 1611. It arose out of the conference between the High
                    Church and Low Church parties which was held by James I. at Hampton Court in
                    1604, being originally proposed by Dr Reynolds, president of Corpus Christi
                    College, Oxford, the leader and spokesman of the LowChurch party, and
                    subsequently on the committee which revised the translation of the Prophets. No
                    real opposition was offered to the proposal, and the king cleverly sketched out
                    on the moment a plan to be adopted. He “wished that some special pains should be
                    taken in that behalf for one uniform translation, and this to be done by the
                    best learned in both universities; after them to be revised by the bishops and
                    the chief learned of the church; from them to be presented to the Privy Council;
                    and lastly, to be ratified by his royal authority. And so this whole church to
                    be bound upon it, and none other.” He also particularly desired that no notes
                    should be added by way of comment in the margin. The appointment of the revisers
                    was a work of much responsibility and labour, and five months elapsed before
                    they were selected and their respective portions assigned to them; but the list
                    of those who began the work, and who, with some few changes in consequence of
                    deaths, brought it to a happy conclusion, shows how large an amount of
                    scholarship was enlisted. It includes Bishop Andrewes, who was familiar with
                    Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Greek, Latin, and ten other languages; Bishop Overall;
                    Dr Saravia; Bedwell, the greatest Arabic scholar of Europe;</p>
                <p>Sir Henry Savile, the most learned layman of his time; and, to say nothing of
                    others well known to later generations, nine who were then or afterwards
                    professors of Hebrew or of Greek at Oxford or Cambridge. It is observable also
                    that they were chosen without reference to party, at least as many of the
                    Puritan clergy as of the opposite party being placed on the committees, and
                    among them Reynolds and Chaderton, two of the four who had represented those
                    clergy in the Hampton Court conference. The following list, taken from the
                    General Introduction to Blunt’s Annotated Bible, is drawn up in such a way as to
                    show the academical or other position which each of them occupied, and the

                <p>When this large body of scholars were set down to their work, a set of rules was
                    drawn up for their guidance, which has happily come down to modern times among
                    the very few records that remain of this great undertaking By whom they were
                    framed is not known, but it is probable that they were well sifted, and passed
                    through several hands before they reached the exact shape in which they were
                    eventually acted upon.</p>
                <p>“1. The ordinary Bible read in the church, commonly called the Bishops’ Bible, to
                    be followed, and as little altered as the truth of the original will permit. 2.
                    The names of the prophets and the holy writers, with the other names of the
                    text, to be retained, as nigh as may be, accordingly as they were vulgarly used.
                    3. The old ecclesiastical words to be kept, <hi rend="italic">videlicet,</hi>
                    the word <hi rend="italic">church</hi> not to be translated <hi rend="italic"
                    >congregation, kc.</hi> 4. When a word hath divers significations, that to be
                    kept which hath been most commonly used by the most of the ancient fathers,
                    being agreeable to the propriety of the place and the analogy of the faith. 5.
                    ’The division of the chapters to be altered either not at all, or as little as
                    may be, if necessity so require. 6. No marginal notes at all to be affixed, but
                    only for the explanation of the Hebrew or Greek words which cannot, without some
                    circumlocution, so briefly and fitly be expressed in the text. 7. Such
                    quotations of places to be marginally set down, as shall serve for the fit
                    references of one scripture to another. 8. Every <pb break="no"

                    chapter or chapters; and having translated or amended them severally by himself,
                    where he thinketh good, all to meet together, confer what they have done, and
                    agree for their parts what shall stand. 9. As any one company hath dispatched
                    any one book in this manner, they shall send it to the rest, to be considered of
                    seriously and judiciously; for his majesty is very careful in this point. 10. If
                    any company, upon the review of the book so sent, doubt or differ upon any
                    place, to send them word thereof, note the place, and withal send the reasons;
                    to which if they consent not, the difference to be compounded at the general
                    meeting, which is to be of the chief persons of each company, at the end of the
                    work. 11. When any place of special obscurity is doubted of, letters to be
                    directed by authority, to send to any learned man in the land for his judgment
                    of such a place. 12. Letters to be sent from every bishop to the rest of his
                    clergy, admonishing them of this translation in hand, and to move and charge as
                    many as, being skilful in the tongues, and having taken pains in that kind, to
                    send his particular observations to the company, either at Westminster,
                    Cambridge, or Oxford, according as it was directed before in the king’s letter
                    to the archbishop. 13. The directors in each company to be the deans of
                    Westminster and Chester for that place, and the king’s professors in Hebrew and
                    Greek in either university. 14. These translations to be used, when they agree
                    better with the text than the Bishop’s Bible, viz., Tyndal’s, Mathew’s,
                    Coverdale’s, Whitchurch’s, Geneva. 15. Besides the said directors before
                    mentioned, three or four of the most ancient and grave divines in either of our
                    universities, not employed in translating, to be assigned by the
                    vice-chancellor, upon conference with the rest of the heads, to be overseers of
                    the translations, as well Hebrew as Greek, for the better observation of the
                    fourth rule above specified.”</p>
                <p>That the work was carried on in the spirit of these rules is shown by the quaint
                    but instructive document which was appended to the Bible as a preface on its
                    completion. It “hath cost the workmen, as light as it seemetb, twice seven times
                    seventy-two days and more: matters of such weight and consequence are to be
                    speeded with maturity: for in a business of moment a man feareth not the blame
                    of convenient slackness. Neither did we think much to consult the translators or
                    commentators, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek, or Latin, no nor the Spanish,
                    French, Italian, or Dutch. Neither did we disdain to revise that which we had
                    done, and to bring back to the anvil that which we had hammered; but having and
                    using such great helps as were needful, and fearing no reproach for slowness,
                    nor coveting praise for expedition, we have at length, through the good hand of
                    the Lord upon us, brought the work to that pass you see.” That work occupied the
                    six committees for four or five years, some parts being brought back to the
                    anvil to be hammered as much as fourteen and some as much as seventeen times.
                    But at length it passed into the hands of the printers, and came from the press
                    of Robert Barker, the king’s patentee, in two contemporary issues of folio
                    volumes, separately composed and printed for the sake of speedy production, in
                    the year 1611. Since that time many millions of this translation or revised
                    translation have been printed, and the general acceptance of it by all
                    English-speaking people of whatever denomination is a testimony to its
                    excellency.</p>
                <p>One principal reason why the English Bible in this last form gives such general
                    satisfaction to the English ear is that it speaks inalanguage of its own which
                    is conventionally received as a Biblical tongue—a language which is thoroughly
                    English, and which iβ yet separated by its archaic form from the colloquial
                    English of every-day use on the one hand, and from the literary English of most
                    other books on the other. This archaic language is not, however, that of
                    Elizabethan and Jacobean times, as is sometimes alleged. Its genealogy is to be
                    traced up in a direct line through every state of Biblical revision to the Latin
                    Vulgate, and the common English ancestor of every such revision is the
                    Wickliffite Bible of the 14th century. This may be seen clearly by placing a
                    passage from the Wickliffite New Testament, in modern spelling but in no other
                    way modernized, beside the same passage taken from the Bible in common use.</p>

                <p>That this remarkable continuity of expression has great practical value is shown
                    by the fact that the only other English Bible which has ever lived beyond one
                    edition, that of the Roman Catholics, has been imperceptibly approximating to
                    the Authorized Version at every revision that it has undergone, since the
                    original publication of the New Testament at Rheims in 1582, and the Old
                    Testament at Douay in 1610. Nor, it is satisfactory to add, has the tender hand
                    with which the Old English of the Bible has been touched in the course of
                    revision led to any sacrifice of sound translation. Modern scholarship may be
                    able to introduce some improvements making the version of still greater value,
                    but upon the whole it already stands preeminent for its accurate representation
                    of the original Hebrew and Greek, and may challenge favourable comparison in
                    this respect with the Septuagint, with the Latin Vulgate, or with any other
                    version.</p>
                <p>The question of revision of the Authorized Version has been frequently discussed,
                    but it is only in very recent times that anything has been done which appears to
                    call for particular mention here. In February 1870 the convocation of
                    Canterbury, at the instigation of the bishop of Winchester, Dr Samuel
                    Wilberforce, appointed a committee to consider the subject, which three months
                    afterwards reported in the following terms :—</p>
                <p>“1. That it is desirable that a revision of the Authorized Version of the Holy
                    Scriptures be undertaken. 2. That the revision bo so conducted as to comprise
                    both marginal renderings, and such emendations as it may be found necessary to
                    insert in the text of the Authorized Version. 3. That in the above resolutions
                    we do not contemplate any new translation of the Bible, or any alteration ot the
                    language, except where, in the judgment of the most competent scholars such
                    change is necessary. 4. That in such necessary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0409-0390"/> changes the style of the language employed in the
                    existing version be closely followed. 5. That it is desirable that Convocation
                    should nominate a body of its own members to undertake the work of revision, who
                    shall be at liberty to invite the co-operation of any eminent for scholarship,
                    to whatever nation or religious body they may belong.”</p>
                <p>The report was adopted, and two companies were formed for the revision of the
                    Authorized Version of the Old and New Testaments respectively, consisting of
                    members of convocation and other distinguished Biblical scholars. During the
                    eight years that have elapsed since their appointmeut the two companies have
                    devoted themselves assiduously to the discharge of the task assigned them, and
                    it is understood that their work is now (1878) approaching completion, but no
                    part of the new revision has yet been published.</p>
                <p>There is still much to be learned respecting the bibliographical history of the
                    English Bible, but several useful works have appeared among the many that have
                    been been written on the subject. The earliest attempt was <hi rend="italic">An
                    Historical Account of the several English Translations of the Bible, Ac.,</hi>
                    by Anthony Johnson, 1730. This was followed in 1731 by Lewis’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Complete History of the several Translations of the Holy Bible and New
                    Testament into English,</hi> which was, until recently, the standard work on the
                    subject. Archbishop Newcome wrote <hi rend="italic">A n Historical View of the
                    English Biblical Translations, Ac.,</hi> with a list of the various editions
                    from 1526 to 1776, which was published at Dublin in 1792. In 1821 Archdeacon
                    Cotton brought out <hi rend="italic">A List of Editions of the Bible and parts
                    thereof in English, from the year</hi> 1505 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 1820,
                    which has been republished in a corrected and enlarged form, and is a work of
                    much value. The <hi rend="italic">Annals of the English Bible,</hi> by
                    Christopher Anderson, printed in two volumes in 1845, was a well-meant attempt
                    to give a complete view of the subject, but is exceedingly diffuse, and is
                    deficient in critical value. Far the most valuable account extant of the
                    Manuscript English Bible is that which forms the preface to Forshall and
                    Madden’s edition of the Wickliffite Bible, published at the Clarendon Press in
                    1850. Taking equally authoritative positions as regards the printed English
                    Bible are λVestcott ’ s <hi rend="italic">General View of the History of the
                    English Bible,</hi> 1868, and the exhaustive account given of the Authorized
                    Version of 1611 in the introduction to Scrivener’s <hi rend="italic">Cambridge
                    Paragraph Bible,</hi> 1873. More recently has appeared, in two volumes, Eadie’s
                    <hi rend="italic">The English Bible: an External and Critical History of the
                    various English Translations of Scripture,</hi> 1876, which is the fullest
                    popular account extant of the whole subject. The most complete list of printed
                    English Bibles is, however, that contained in <hi rend="italic">The Bibles iιι
                    the Caxton Exhibition,</hi> by Henry Stevens, 1878, where much valuable
                    bibliographical information on the subject is to be found. (J. H. BL.)</p>
