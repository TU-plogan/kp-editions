                    Their genealogy, according to Muratori, can be traced back to the small princes
                    who governed Tuscany under the Carlovingians, and who some time afterwards
                    received certain districts or counties from them in fief. They are in all
                    probability of Longobard origin, but there is no authentic record of their
                    succession reaching farther back than to the marquis Adalbert who died about
                    917. They were called Este after the town of that name, and the title marquis of
                    Este was first borne by <hi rend="smallcaps">Albert</hi> Azzo IL, who married
                    Kunitza or Kunigonda, sister of Welph or Guelph III., duke of Carinthia. Welph
                    died without issue, and the eldest son of Kunitza, Welph IV., succeeded to his
                    inheritance, and marrying a daughter of Otho IL, duke of Bavaria, was created
                    duke of Bavaria, on Otho’s death without male succession, in 1071. Through him
                    the house of Este thus became connected with the princely houses of Brunswick
                    and Hanover, from which are descended the sovereigns of England. The Italian
                    title and estates were inherited by <hi rend="smallcaps">Fulco</hi> I.
                    (1060-1135), son of Albert Azzo II. by his second marriage to Garisenda,
                    countess of Maine, in France. Hugo, the second son by this marriage, inherited
                    his mother’s property in France, but as he died without issue, it ultimately
                    came into the possession of Fulco and his successors. During the 12th, 13th, and
                    14th centuries, the history of the Estensi is interwoven with that of the other
                    princely houses of northern Italy, of the struggles for supremacy between pope
                    and emperor, of the contests between rival cities, and even of the factions into
                    which individual cities were sometimes divided. From the rivalry between the
                    German Welphs and Weiblungen the names Guelfs and Ghibelines came to be used to
                    designate the two great rival Italian parties; and, as the head of the Guelf
                    party, the Estensi received at different periods the sovereignties of Ferrara,
                    Modena, and ¾0ggio. They distinguished themselves also as the patrons of
                    literature and the fine arts, and had intimate relatit&gt;ns with Ariosto and
                    Tasso.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Obizzo</hi> I., son of Fulco I., entered into a league
                    against Frederick Barbarossa, and was comprehended in the Venetian treaty of
                    1177 by which municipal podestas were instituted. He was elected podesta of
                    Padua in 1182; and in 1184 Frederick named him marquis of Milan and Genoa, a
                    dignity somewhat similar to that of imperial vicar. By carrying off Marchesella,
                    heiress of the Adelardi family of Ferrara, and marrying her to his son Azzo V.,
                    he obtained for his family a predominant influence in that city also, but
                    kindled a strife with the family of Torello which continued to rage for two
                    centuries. Obizzo I. died about 1190; and Azzo V. died about eleven years later
                    and was succeeded by Azzo VI. (1170-1212), who became the head of the Guelf
                    party. During the whole lifetime of Azzo VI. a civil war raged almost
                    uninterruptedly in the streets of Ferrara, each party, it is said, being ten
                    times driven from the city. Azzo died in November 1212, and was succeeded by <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Aldovrandino,</hi> who in 1213 concluded a treaty with
                    Salinguerra Torello, by which the government of Ferrara was divided between
                    them. He died in 1215, and was succeeded by his brother Azzo VII. (1205-1264),
                    surnamed <hi rend="italic">Novellο</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Young.</hi>
                    Between him and Eccelino IIΓ. de Romano, who leagued himself with the Tυrelli, a
                    war broke out in 1229, and although a temporary reconciliation was effected in
                    1233, and Azzo was affianced to Adelaide, niece of Eccelino, it was renewed
                    after his marriage in 1235. At first Eccelino, who supported the cause of
                    Frederick IL, was completely victorious in Lombardy, but the influence of Pope
                    Alexander VI. gradually helped to combine the towns of Lombardy against him, and
                    Azzo also received the assistance of many fugitives whom the tyranny of Eccelino
                    had driven from Padua and Verona. Finally, after two years indecisive
                    skirmishing, Eccelino accepted battle at Cassano, 16th September 1259, and was
                    completely defeated and taken prisoner, surviving his overthrow only a few days.
                    Azzo died 17th February 1264, and was succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Obizzo</hi> II. (1240-1293), who in 1288 received the lordship of Modena, and
                    in 1290 that of Reggio. Obizzo was succeeded by his son Azzo VIII., who was
                    elected perpetual sovereign of Modena and Reggio. The two brothers of Azzo,
                    hθλvever, laid claim the one to Modena and the other to Reggio, and succeeded in
                    capturing from him both towns. He wa3 also driven from Este, but an attempt to
                    deprive him of Ferrara was unsuccessful. Azzo died 31st January 1308. He had no
                    legitimate children, and, on account of the hostility towards him of his two
                    brothers, he named as his successor his grandson Fulco III., by his illegitimate
                    son Francis, but despairing of holding possession of Ferrara against the
                    brothers of Azzo, Francis, acting for his infant son, ceded it to the Venetians
                    in lieu of an annual payment, and retired with Fulco to Venice, where they died
                    in obscurity.</p>
                <p>After this the possession of Ferrara, Modena, Reggio, and their dependencies was
                    disputed for some years with varying results by the Venetians, the pope, and
                    rival members of the legitimate line of Estensi, but from the time of Azzo VIII.
                    the Estensi annals are intricate, confused, and of little interest until <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nicholas</hi> III. (1384- 1441), who exercised sovereignty over
                    Ferrara, Modena, Parma, and Reggio, was declared by Boniface IX «captain general
                    of the army of the church, and enjoyed in his later years the intimate
                    friendship of the duke of Milan. He died suddenly from poison, most probably
                    administered by his enemies at the court of Milan to prevent his being named the
                    duke’s successor. To him succeeded <hi rend="smallcaps">Lionel,</hi> who died in

                    his brother <hi rend="smallcaps">Hercules</hi> I. (1443-1505), who, with the
                    help of the Venetians, seized the sovereignty of Ferrara from Nicholas, the son
                    of Lionel, and afterwards, with the help of Ferdinand king of Naples, retained
                    it against the Venetians and Pope Sixtus IV. The last twenty-five years of his
                    reign were peaceful and prosperous, and his capital became noted both for its
                    luxury and as the resort of men eminent in literature and art. Count Boiardo the
                    poet was his minister, and Ariosto also obtained his patronage and friendship.
                    To Herculee succeeded <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> I. (1486- 1534), who
                    was married to Lucretia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI. During nearly the
                    whole of his reign Alphonsowas engaged in the Italian wars, and in his
                    complicated and difficult position manifested so much energy and adroitness, and
                    such skill as a general, that for a long time he was almost uniformly successful
                    in his enterprises. On the formation in 1508 of the league of Cambray against
                    the republic of Venice he was appointed by Pope Julius II. to the supreme
                    command of the papal troops; but after the Venetians had sustained a
                    considerable number of reverses they made peace with the pope, and agreed to
                    join him against the French. Alphonso was invited to co-operate with the new
                    alliance, and on his refusal war was declared against him; but although he at
                    first lost Modena and Reggio, he subsequently inflicted a succession of defeats
                    on the papal troops. He was, however, desirous of peace, and had gone to Rome
                    with the purpose of making submission to the pope, when the news that orders had
                    been given for his arrest reached him in time only to enable him to make his
                    escape. On the defeat of the French by the combined arms of Charles V. and Pope
                    Leo X., the possessions of Alphonso were confiscated, but after the death of Leo
                    he was reinstated in them by Charles V. He died on the 31st October 1534, and
                    was succeeded by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Hercules</hi> II. (1508-1559), who
                    married Renée daughter of Louis XII. of France, and, joining the league of Henry
                    II. of France and Pope Paul IV. against Spain, was named lieutenant-general of
                    the French army in Italy, and general of the army of the church. The war was,
                    however, prosecuted with little vigour, and peace was made with Spain in 1558.
                    Hercules and his brother Cardinal Hippolytus the younger, were patrons of
                    literature and art, and the latter built the splendid castle of Este. Hercules
                    II. was succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> II., well known on
                    account of his imprisonment of the poet Tasso. Alphonso died in 1597 without
                    issue, and bequeathed his estate to his cousin <hi rend="smallcaps">Caesar</hi>
                    (1562-1 628), but Pope Clement VIII. laid claim to Ferrara, and by a treaty with
                    Lucretia, sister of Alphonso, it was given up to the see of Rome. Caesar held
                    Modena and Reggio, but with him the splendour of the house of Este began to
                    fade, and from that time it plays only a very subordinate part in Italian
                    history.</p>
                <p>The subsequent heads of the Este family were <hi rend="smallcaps">Alp∏onso</hi>
                    III., who retired in 1629 to a monastery in the Tyrol, where he ended his days
                    in 1644; <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi> I. (1610-1658), who was general of
                    the French army in Italy; <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> IV. (1634-1662),
                    the father of Mary, the queen of James II. of England, who held a position in
                    the French army during the Spanish war, and by whom was founded the gallery of
                    pictures at Modena; <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi> II. (1660-1694), who
                    originated the library of Este and founded the University of Modena; <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rinaldo</hi> (1665-1737), through whose marriage with Charlotte
                    Felicitas of Brunswick, the long separated branches of the house of Este were
                    again united; <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi> III. (1698-1780), who married
                    the daughter of Philippe of Orleans, was named by the king of Spain
                    generalissimo of the Spanish troops in Italy, had his duchy devastated by the
                    imperial troops, but was re-established in its possession by the treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, and, having reconciled himself with Maria Theresa, received
                    from her the title of governor-general of Lombardy; and, finally, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hercules Rinaldo</hi> (1727-1803), who at the peace of Campo
                    Fermo lost the duchies of Modena and Reggio, and with whom the male branch of
                    the house of Este died out. His only daughter was married to Ferdinand, third
                    son of the emperor Francis I. Ferdinand was created duke of Breisgau, and dying
                    in 1806 was succeeded by Francis IV., who in 1816 was restored to the duchy of
                    Modena and Reggio, and on the death of his mother inherited also the duchy of
                    Massa and Carrara. He died January 26, 1846, and was succeeded in 1846 by his
                    son Francis V., who lost his possessions by the events of 1859. On his death in
                    1875 the male line of the Austrian branch of the Estensi became extinct, and the
                    title passed to Archduke Francis eldest son of the Archduke Charles Louis. The
                    children of Lady Murray daughter of the earl of Kintore, by her marriage with
                    August Frederick duke of Sussex, sixth son of George III. of England, assumed
                    the old name Este, and claimed recognition as members of the royal family; but
                    as the marriage was in violation of an Act regarding royal marriages passed in
                    1772, it was declared invalid, and their claims were set aside.</p>
