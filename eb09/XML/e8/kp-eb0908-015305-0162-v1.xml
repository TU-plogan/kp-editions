                            Mountstuart</hi></label> (1779-1859), an eminent Indian statesman,
                    fourth son of the eleventh Baron Elphinstone in the peerage of Scotland, was
                    born in 1779. Having received an appointment in the civil service of the East
                    India Company, of which one of his uncles was a director, he reached Calcutta in
                    the beginning of 1796. After filling several subordinate posts, he was appointed
                    in 1801 assistant to the British resident at Poonah, at the court of the
                    Peishwa, the most powerful of the Mahratta princes. Here he obtained his first
                    opportunity of distinction, being attached in the capacity of diplomatist to the
                    mission of Sir Arthur Wellesley to the Mahrattas. When, on the failure of
                    negotiations, war broke out, Elphinstone, though a civilian, acted as virtual
                    aide-de-camp to General Wellesley. He was present at the battle of Assaye, and
                    displayed such courage and knowledge of tactics throughout the whole campaign
                    that Wellesley told him he had mistaken his profession, and that he ought to
                    have been a soldier. In 1806, when the war closed, he was appointed British
                    resident at Nagpore. Here, the times being uneventful and his duties light, he
                    occupied much of his leisure in reading classical and general literature, and
                    acquired those studious habits which clung to him throughout life. In 1808 he
                    was placed at the head of a most important political mission to Central Asia,
                    being appointed the first British envoy to the court of Cabul, with the object
                    of securing a friendly alliance with the Afghans in view of a possible French
                    invasion. The negotiations, protracted and difficult, resulted in a treaty
                    securing what the English wished; but it proved of little value, partly because
                    the danger of invasion had passed away, and partly because the Shah Shuja was
                    driven from the throne by his brother before it could be ratified. The most
                    valuable permanent result of the embassy was the literary fruit it bore several
                    years afterwards in Elphinstone’s great work on Cabul. After spending about a
                    year in Calcutta arranging the report of his mission. Elphinstone was appointed
                    in 1811 to the important and difficult post of resident at Poonah. The
                    difficulty arose from the general complication of Mahratta politics, and
                    especially from the weak and treacherous character of the Peishwa, which
                    Elphinstone rightly read from the first. While the mask of friendship was kept
                    up Elphinstone carried out the only suitable policy, that of vigilant
                    quiescence, with admirable tact and patience; when in 1817 the mask was thrown
                    aside and the Peishwa ventured to declare war, the English resident proved for
                    the second time the truth of Wellesley’s assertion that he was bom a soldier.
                    Though his own account of his share in the campaign is characteristically
                    modest, one can gather from it that the success of the English troops was
                    chiefly owing to his assuming the command at an important crisis during the
                    battle of Kirkee. When Poonah fell he humanely exerted himself with almost
                    complete success to prevent a seemingly inevitable sack of the town by the
                    incensed soldiers. The Peishwa being driven from his throne, his territories
                    were annexed to the British dominions, and Elphinstone was nominated
                    commissioner to administer them. He discharged the responsible task with rare
                    judgment and ability. The characteristic feature of his policy was his
                    scrupulous regard for the customs, interests, and wishes of the native
                    population, in so far as these were <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n163/mode/1up"

                    Recognizing the deep-seated conservatism of the Hindu character, he avoided
                    needless change, and sought rather to develop what reforms seemed essential from
                    within than to impose them from without. With this view he preserved as far as
                    possible the native system of administration of justice, and maintained the
                    landholders and chiefs in the possession of their rights and privileges. His
                    conciliatory administration not only drew to him personally the attachment of
                    all classes, but was of the utmost benefit in confirming the British authority
                    in the newly annexed territory, which might easily have been brought by a
                    different policy to throw off the yoke.</p>
                <p>So high was Elphinstone’s reputation for administrative ability, that, when the
                    lieutenant-governorship of Bombay fell vacant in 1819, the Court of Directors
                    appointed him to the position in preference to two candidates of distinguished
                    merit who were both his seniors. He entered upon his new duties in 1820, and
                    discharged them until 1827, when he was succeeded by Sir John Malcolm. The
                    period was tranquil, and the governor devoted himself to internal reforms with
                    that happy combination of zeal and discretion which always distinguished him.
                    His principal achievement was the drawing up of the Elphinstone code, -which for
                    comprehensiveness, clearness, and equity takes a high rank among works of its
                    class. He faithfully carried out the policy of retrenchment prescribed by the
                    East India Company, and it may be noted as characteristic that he commenced his
                    economic reforms by reducing the Government House establishment. His efforts to
                    promote native education, however, had probably more beneficial and far-reaching
                    results than any other department of his activity. He may fairly be regarded as
                    the founder of the system of state education in India, and he probably did more
                    than any other Indian administrator to further every likely scheme for the
                    promotion of native education. Adhering to the policy he had adopted at Poonah
                    of respecting the customs, opinions, feelings, and even—wherever possible— the
                    prejudices of the native population, he won their attachment in quite an
                    exceptional degree. Bishop Heber, who specially admired his zeal in the cause of
                    education, spoke of him as one of the most extraordinary men and certainly the
                    most popular governor that he had fallen in with. Of his popularity remarkable
                    proof was afforded both by natives and Europeans when he resigned his post. The
                    farewell addresses which poured iu upon him were almost innumerable; and his
                    connection with the presidency was most appropriately commemorated in the
                    endowment by the native communities of the Elphinstone College, and in the
                    erection of a statue in marble by the European inhabitants of the
                    presidencies.</p>
                <p>Elphinstone spent nearly two years on the journey home, visiting Egypt and
                    Palestine, and many of the scenes in Greece and Italy with which he was already
                    familiar as an ardent student of classical literature. On his arrival in England
                    the choice was open to him of a distinguished career in home politics or the
                    highest place in the management of Indian affairs. But he was deficient in
                    ambition, and his health had suffered so much from his residence in India that
                    he deemed himself disqualified for public life. Accordingly, although the
                    governor-generalship of India was twice offered to him in the most flattering
                    terms within a few years of his return, he declined it on both occasions; and he
                    resisted with equal firmness all attempts to induce him to enter the home
                    parliament. It is understood that he declined the offer of a peerage. The
                    retirement in which he spent the last thirty years of his life, however, was far
                    from being either indolent or dishonourable. He kept up the habit of study he
                    had acquired in India, he made contributions of the highest value to literature,
                    and he preserved until his death the liveliest interest in the affairs of the
                    great empire which had been the scene of his activity. His advice was always
                    taken and generally followed in difficult questions of Indian policy, and he
                    kept up constant communication by correspondence and otherwise with leading
                    Indian administrators, so that his personal influence continued to be an
                    important factor in the government of India almost to the day of his death. He
                    had long before his return from India made his reputation as an author by the
                    work on Cabul already mentioned, which was published in 1815 with the title An
                    Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its Dependencies in Persia and India. Soon
                    after his arrival in England he commenced the preparation of a work of wider
                    scope, a history of Iudia, which was published in 1841. It embraced the Hindu
                    and Mahometan periods, and is generally regarded as a work of the highest
                    authority. Its chief features are thoroughness of research, judicious use of
                    materials, and condensation of style.</p>
                <p>Mr Elphinstone died at his residence at Limpsfield, in Surrey, on the 20th
                    November 1859. (w. B. s.)</p>
