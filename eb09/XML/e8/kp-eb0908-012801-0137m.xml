                <p><label type="entry">ELEUSIS</label>, a small city of Attica about fourteen miles
                    north-west of Athens, occupying the eastern part of a rocky ridge close to the
                    shore opposite the island of Salamis. Like most of the other cities of Greece,
                    its origin is ascribed to various fabulous characters, and, among these, to
                    Ogyges, a fact which at least proves it to be of the highest antiquity. In the
                    earlier period of its history it seems to have been an independent rival of
                    Athens, and it was afterwards reckoned one of the twelve Old Attic cities. A
                    considerable portion of its small territory was •occupied by the plains of
                    Thria, noticeable for their fertility, though the hopes of the husbandmen were
                    not unfrequently disappointed by the blight of the south wind. To the west was
                    the Campus Rharius, ∏∈δiov ’ Pαpιov, or Rharian Plain, where Demeter is said to
                    have sown the first seeds of corn; in the midst of the Campus was the Kαλλiχopov
                    φpiap, a well rouud which the Eleusinian matrons are said at first to have
                    danced in honour of the goddess; and on its confines was the field called Orgas,
                    planted with trees consecrated to Demeter and Proserpine. To the traveller
                    approaching by the Sacred Way from the east the first building that presented
                    itself was the temple of Triptolemus, the site of which is now occupied by the
                    little church of St Zacharias; and next came a temple dedicated to Artemis
                    Propylaea and Poseidon, constructed entirely of Pentelic marble. Entrance into
                    the outer peribolos, or inclosure, of the great temple of the mysteries was
                    obtained by means of a portico built in imitation of the propylaea of the
                    Athenian citadel; into the inner peribolos by another dedicated by the consul
                    Appius Claudius Pulcher, in 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and executed by
                    his nephew Claudius Pulcher and Marcius Rex. The temple itself, sacred to
                    Demeter and Kora (Ceres and Proserpine), was considered one of the most
                    beautiful productions of the genius of Greece. The original foundation is said
                    to have been due to Pandion IL, and Clemens Alexandrinus places it even 120
                    years earlier, in the reign of Lynceus. Its position and riches naturally
                    exposed the temple to the attacks of the enemies of Attica; and, though defended
                    by a strong fortress, it was seldom able to make any lengthened resistance.
                    Cleomenes, king of Sparta, dared to violate its sacred precincts; but, if we may
                    believe the Athenians, he was soon after seized with a retributive fit of
                    madness. The Persians burnt it to the ground after the battle of Plataea; but
                    scarcely had they retired from Greece, when the Athenians determined to rebuild
                    it with more than its original magnificence. Ictinus, the architect of the
                    Parthenon, was ordered to draw up the plan of the new edifice. He adopted the
                    Doric order of architecture, without the erection of pillars in front of the
                    building. We know not whether he lived long enough to carry his plan into
                    execution; but it was during the splendid administration of Pericles, and under
                    the cultivated taste of Phidias, that the temple was completed in all its
                    magnificence. The mystic cell <hi rend="smallcaps">(∕λio∙tikos</hi> σηκός,
                    άνάκτορον, or τελeστηp(οv') was begun by Corcebus, but he lived only to finish
                    the lower row of columns, with their architraves. Metagenes, of the district of
                    Xypete, added the rest of the entablature, and the upper row of columns.
                    Xenocles of Cholarge built the dome on the top. A portico was long afterwards
                    added by Demetrius Phalereus, who employed for that purpose the architect Philo.
                    This maguificent structure continued to exist till the hordes of Alaric
                    completed its overthrow in 396 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The city
                    disappeared on the destruction of the temple; and upon the site nothing is now
                    found but a miserable village called Lefsina (A∈υσ7vα), or Lepsina, amidst the
                    ruins of the sacred edifice. The coins of Eleusis are still common, representing
                    Demeter drawn by dragons or serpents, and bearing the inscription EΛEYSI or EΛEY
                    within a wreath of ears of corn. A colossal statue of the goddess, regarded by
                    the inhabitants as their patroness and protectress, was removed to England in
                    1801, and is now preserved in Cambridge.</p>
