                <p><label type="entry">ESSEX</label>, the tenth in size of the English counties, is
                    situated on the S.E. coast, and is consequently bounded on the E. and S.E. by
                    the North Sea. On the S. it is separated from Kent by the river Thames, on the
                    W. from Middlesex and Hertfordshire by the Lea and the Stort, and on the N.E.
                    from Suffolk by the Stour, while on the N. it is conterminous with
                    Cambridgeshire.</p>
                <p>Essex contains 1,055,133 acres, or 1648 square miles. The population in 1851 was
                    369,318; in 1861, 404,834; and in 1871, 466,436 (233,903 males and 232,533
                    females). The increase is found to be almost entirely in the south-western
                    corner of the county contiguous to the metropolis,—the parish of West Ham, which
                    by the last census contained 62,919 inhabitants, being now estimated to have
                    about 110,000. The coast has an exceedingly irregular outline, and, short as it
                    is, it is deeply indented by estuaries of no less than three rivers—the Stour at
                    Harwich, the Blackwater and Colne at Maldon, and the Thames; and as may be
                    suggested by this fact, the seaboard entirely lacks the bold and rugged beauty
                    of the shores of the west of England. The rivers, with the exception of the
                    Thames, are insignificant; and so far as they are navigable they are useful
                    chiefly for the transport of agricultural produce. Harwich is the only
                    considerable harbour, but Wivenhoe, on the Colne, is celebrated for its
                    yacht-building. The sea has within, historic times encroached upon the land; and
                    near Walton, on the Naze, ruins of buildings have been discerned at low water on
                    a shoal known as the West Rocks, five miles out. On the cliffs of Walton are to
                    be found interesting geological remains. In the parish of Dagenham there is a
                    large tract at a lower level than the river, protected by an extensive dyke,
                    which was restored in 1723 at an expense of nearly £42,500.</p>
                <p>The Crouch, the Blackwater, and the Colne all supply favourite beds for oyster
                    layers; and lawsuits to determine the right of dredging in these rivers have
                    been pending for years. Barking sends out a large fleet of fishing smacks in the
                    pursuit of turbot, soles, cod, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Geologically the county rests almost entirely upon the London clay, which has
                    been frequently pierced and found to be of great thickness. At Lamarsh, during
                    the con struction of the Stour Valley Railway, parts of a fossil elephant were
                    discovered in a gravel stratum 14 feet below the surface. The soil of the
                    southern and eastern portions is mostly of a rich alluvial character, with
                    occasional traces of gravel; the Roothings in the centre are clay; but the
                    northern district is sound loam, becoming lighter as it approaches
                    Cambridgeshire. The landscape varies in like degree, the flat, uninteresting,
                    but fertile grazing grounds near the coast and rivers providing a strong
                    contrast to the undulating and .frequently hilly neighbourhoods of Danbury,
                    Baddow, Wickham, Weald, Laindou Hills, Havering, Warley, and Hedingham.</p>
                <p>The roads of this county could hardly be surpassed; with a clay soil foundation,
                    they have for generations been repaired with flints picked by women and children
                    from the surface of the fields,—an industry which will die out under the new
                    Education Acts. Gravel is difficult of access, and ≡oιne of the inland towns are
                    purchasing granite for their streets; near Good Easter and Chignal, not ten
                    miles from Chelmsford, the road surveyors are driven to the expedient of
                    collecting pebbles from the brooks. With the exception of chalk for lime (mainly
                    obtained at Ballingdon in the north and Grays in the south), septaria for making
                    cement, and clay for bricks, the underground riches of the county are meagre,
                    and it is to agriculture that we must look for the internal resources of
                    Essex.</p>
                <p>For the large quantity and the fine quality of both its wheat and its barley
                    Essex has long been famous. Essex wheat is one of the standard quotations of the
                    London markets, and thousands of quarters are exported to the north of England,
                    as well as to France, for seed purposes; the Essex Rough Chaff, the Nursery, the
                    Golden Drop, and the Taunton Dean, all flourish in perfection. What the barley
                    lacks in delicacy of appearance and in fineness of skin, it makes up for in
                    weight and size of berry, and in its kindly nature in malting. Beans are a
                    prolific crop in most parts of the country, and pease, both for harvesting and
                    for picking green for the London market, produce abundantly. The enormous
                    importations from Russia and Sweden have caused farmers to neglect the
                    cultivation of oats, and to turn their attention to the growth of the more
                    lucrative barley; and the acreage of mangel-wurtzel and of kohlrabi is gradually
                    increasing, to the diminution of the more precarious turnip crop. The system of
                    agriculture has undergone changes so great that the men of two generations ago
                    could scarcely now recognize the face of the country, nor comprehend the routine
                    of the farm. The extravagantly high and wide fences and the cramped little
                    fields have given way to a more intelligent scheme; the antiquated four-course
                    shift is seldom heard of except in covenants<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n574/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0574-0553"/> controlling the last period of leases; long
                    fallows are abandoned; steam cultivation has become general; the sickle is
                    replaced by the reaping-machine, and other machines are employed to mow the
                    grass, and shake it out, gather it, and even to “cock” it and elevate it to the
                    stacks; in like manner the cereal crops are sown, hoed, reaped, stacked, and
                    thrashed by a force superior to, and cheaper than, manual power; and the
                    employment of women and gangs of children in the fields, once so general, is now
                    the exception. The generous treatment of the land by the farmers of the county
                    has been followed by corresponding concessions on the part of the landowners;
                    and although the recent Agricultural Holdings Act has become nearly a dead
                    letter owing to landlords “contracting themselves out of the Act,” yet there is
                    for the most part a mutual good feeling between owner and occupier, and in cases
                    where leases are granted the covenants are practical and liberal. It is
                    probable, however, that in no county in England is the phrase “farming by the
                    custom of the country” so vague and elastic as in Essex; the system which is
                    successful “on the flat” in the district north of Finchingfield and Radwinter
                    would be ruinous or impossible in Dengie Hundred, with its deep furrows drawn by
                    powerful and costly teams between the narrow reaches of Burleigh, Mundon, and
                    Latchingdon; notwithstanding, both districts produce excellent crops. Not the
                    least interesting feature in the agriculture of the county is the rapid
                    disillusion which has taken place with regard to the growth of certain varieties
                    of farm produce, which it was supposed could only be raised on certain soils and
                    in certain districts,—notably the cultivation of root crops and of barley, which
                    now take their place in the ordinary rotation nearly throughout Essex. There
                    are, it is true, localities particularly favourable to certain crops, and at
                    Castle Hedingham, at Sible Hedingham, and Coggeshall, and at Feering we find
                    seed-growing practised both for the farm and the garden; at Wethersfield,
                    Shalford, Hedingham, and Booking are hop-grounds, which are, however, gradually
                    dying out; Tiptree Heath supplies large quantities of fruit, used principally by
                    the London traders for preserving; the teasel and the aromatic seeds, coriander
                    and caraway, have well-nigh disappeared; onions, French beans, cabbages,
                    potatoes, indeed all kinds of vegetables, are produced at Barking, Rainham,
                    Aveley, and the neighbourhood, whence they are transferred by road to Covent
                    Garden Market. Agricultural horses are imported from Suffolk, Norfolk,
                    Lincolnshire, and Belgium, comparatively few being bred at home. Several herds
                    of shorthorns have been established, but thousands of store bullocks are
                    introduced from Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Ireland, and Wales; of sheep there are
                    but few distinct flocks; the pig tribe is represented by a high-class Berkshire
                    type,—the “improved Essex,” a breed introduced by the late Fisher Hobbs, having
                    become absorbed by frequent crossing. From the comparative dryness of the
                    climate Essex does not excel in pasturage, and in consequence the majority of
                    farmers devote their attention to winter grazing, and fatten their stock upon
                    roots, cut hay, bean-meal, pease-meal, and vast quantities of oilcake, usually
                    of American manufacture. The county possesses one of the largest and most
                    influential agricultural associations in the kingdom, numbering between 800 and
                    900 members, and giving away from .£1500 to .£1900 annually in prizes, many of
                    which are open for competition to all England; the chamber of agriculture has
                    G00 subscribers. Attempts at sewage farming have been made in several
                    localities, but in most cases the sewage farm is looked upon as a necessary
                    evil. Many of the minor towns have their sewage farm attached, but the disposal
                    of the drainage usually exhausts any possible remuneration for the excessive
                    outlay.</p>
                <p>Essex, which was at one time famous for the extent of its forests, has for many
                    years been decreasing its acreage of woodland. Epping Forest, which is of the
                    estimated extent of 60,000 acres, has been in jeopardy of encroachment, but by
                    the “Epping Forest Act, 1871,” a board of commissioners was appointed for the
                    better management of the lands; the corporation of the city of London has
                    acquired by purchase the freehold interest of waste land belonging to the lords
                    of the manor, thus, at an outlay of £50,000, securing 800 acres for the benefit
                    of the public for ever; the Ancient Court of Verderers has also been revived,
                    and consists of an hereditary lord warden together with four verderers elected
                    by freeholders of the county. The celebrated Fairlop oak, which measured 45 feet
                    in girth, was blown down in 1820; the largest now standing is only 18 feet in
                    girth. Hainault Forest was disafforested in 1851.</p>
                <p>The landowners of Essex number 22,305, of whom 14,833, or 66⅜ per cent., hold
                    less than one acre each, the proportion for ail England being 71 per cent. The
                    gross estimated rental is put at £2,166,077, or £2, 5s. 6fd. per acre, as
                    compared with £3, 0s. 2^d. for all England. From the return of 1873 we find that
                    of owners possessing more than 5000 acres each, Lord Petre, Thorndon Hall, owns
                    19,085 acres; Lord Braybrooke, Audley End, 9684; Executors of Lord Maynard,
                    Easton Lodge, 8617; Lord Rayleigh, Terling Place, 8536; the Governors of Guy’s
                    Hospital, 8400; Sir T. C. C. Western, Felix Hall, 7875; R. B. Wingfield Baker,
                    Orsett Hall, 7579; J. Archer Homblon, Great Hallingbury, 7127; J. Jolliffe
                    Tufnel, Langleys, 6582; Mrs Honywood, Markshall, 6436; Colonel Bramston,
                    Skreens, 6318; Executors of T. G G. White, Berechurch Hall, 5600; Crown
                    property, 5526; the Governors of the Charter House, 5481; Sir C. Du Cane,
                    Braxted Park, 5409; the Countess Waldegrave, Dudbrook, 5108.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing establishments in the county comprise the various iron works at
                    Chelmsford, Colchester, Maldon, Colne, Halstead, and Rayne (which supply
                    agricultural implements for local use), important crape factories at Booking and
                    Halstead, a large manufactory of rich damasks and satins for furniture at
                    Bocking, and a considerable jute factory at Barking. There are also Government
                    gunpowder mills at Waltham Abbey.</p>
                <p>The county forms nineteen “hundreds,” each comprising several parishes, and one
                    “liberty,” that of Havering-atte-Bower, which includes Hornchurch and Romford.
                    The “liberty” has a special jurisdiction of its own, independent of the county,
                    having its own high steward, magistrates, clerk of the peace, coroner, and
                    quarter sessions for the trial of offences committed within the borders of three
                    parishes.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Colchester (population, 26,343), Chelmsford (9318),
                    Maldon (population of parliamentary borough, 7151), Romford (6335), Harwich
                    (6079), Halstead (5783), Barking (5766), Saffrou Walden (5718), Braintree
                    (4790), Witham (3347), Dunmow (3342). For parliamentary purposes the county is
                    divided into three constituencies, east, south, and west, each returning two
                    members; the borough of Colchester also sends two representatives to the House
                    of Commons, while Maldon and Harwich elect one each, making a total of ten
                    members. There are 250 justices of the peace for the county, which is divided
                    into 18 petty sessional divisions. There are 17 poor law unions, 10 local boards
                    of health, and 62 school boards. A large camp at Colchester, usually containing
                    3000 infantry and 1000 artillery and cavalry, is the headquarters of the eastern
                    district of England, Great Warley being the military centre for Essex. Two
                    regiments of militia are established, the Essex rifles and the West Essex
                    regiment, having their head-quarters at Colchester and at Chelmsford
                    respectively.</p>

                <p>According to the recent alterations in the arrangement of the circuits, Essex,
                    Herts, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire are included in the
                    south-eastern circuit, formed by the amalgamation of the home circuit with a
                    portion of the Norfolk circuit. Ecclesiastically Essex belongs to the new
                    diocese of St Albans, instead of Rochester, as formerly. The new see, which also
                    embraces Herts, has a population of 659,152, and an area of 2268 square miles.
                    The county lunatic asylum is situated between Brentwood and Warley barracks;
                    there is an infant orphan asylum at Wanstead, and a seaman’s orphan asylum at
                    Snaresbrooke.</p>
                <p>Essex is comparatively poor in prehistoric remains, but for this it is richly
                    compensated by the variety and value of its Roman and mediaeval antiquities. The
                    so-called Dane·pits not improbably belong to the pre-Roman period: they are
                    almost certainly shafts sunk for chalk, and we know that at a very early date
                    this material was exported from Britain to the Continent. By some antiquaries
                    Lexden is regarded as the site of the <hi rend="italic">British</hi> town of
                    Camulodunum, and certain mounds are identified with its defences. We know from
                    history that within the present boundaries of Essex the Romans had not only
                    their great central post of Camulodunum, but also stations called Durolitum,
                    Caesaromagus, Canonum, Iceanuιn, and Othona. The site of several of these,
                    however, is still matter of debate. Durolitum was possibly at or near Romford,
                    no Roman remains having been found at Layton, which was on <hi
                    rend="superscript"> p</hi> e selected from a very superficial similarity of
                    name; Caesaromagus is usually identified with Chelmsford, and Iceanum with
                    Chesterford; and there is little or no doubt that Othona, the Ithanceaster of
                    Bede, was situated near Bradwell. Roman military works have been recognized at
                    Danbury, Tilbury, Harwich, Fleshy, &amp;c., Roman dwellinghouses discovered at
                    Chelmsford, at Sunken Church Field, near Hadstock, at Ridgewell, &amp;c., and
                    Roman cemeteries or tombs at Chelmsford, Chesterford, Hadstock, Bartlow,
                    Coggeshall, and Wormingfield. At Wormingfield alone hundreds of urns have been
                    exhumed. Large quantities of Roman ware have turned up at Stifford and Canvey
                    Island; and Hallingbury church is far from the only building that has been
                    indebted to the Roman brickmakers. Of Roman works of art discovered in the
                    county perhaps the most remarkable are the Colchester Sphinx and an effigy of a
                    centurion unearthed in the same town. A Roman road connected London with
                    Camulodunum, and another ran from Camulodunum to Cambridge, and sent off a
                    branch to St Albans. It is supposed by many antiquaries that Saxon masonry can
                    be detected in the foundations of several of the Essex churches, but, with the
                    exception of Ashing-don church tower, believed to have been erected by Canute
                    after his victory over Edmund Ironside, there is certainly no very recognizable
                    building belonging to that period. This is probably to be in part ascribed to
                    the fact that the comparative scarcity of stone and the unusual abundance of
                    timber led to the extensive employment of the latter material. Many of the Essex
                    churches, as Blackmore, Mountnessing, Margaretting, and South Bemfleet, hive
                    still massive porches and towers of timber; and St Andrew’s church, Greenstead,
                    with its walls of solid oak, continues an almost unique example of its kind. Of
                    the four “round churches” in England one is in Essex at Little Maplestead; but
                    it is both the smallest and the most modern. The churches of South Weald,
                    Hadleigh, Blackmore, Heybridge, and Hadstock may be mentioned as containing
                    Norman masonry; Southchurch, Danbury, and Boreham as being partly Early English
                    , Ingatestone, Stebbing, and Tilty for specimens of decorated architecture; and
                    Messing, Thaxted, and Saffron Walden as specimens of the Perpendicular. Stained
                    glass windows have left their traces in several of the churches, the finest
                    remains being those of Margaretting, which represent a tree of Jesse and the
                    daisy or herb Margaret. Paintings have evidently been largely used for internal
                    decoration: a remarkable series, probably of the 12th century, but much restored
                    in the 14th, exists in the chancel of Copford church; and in the church at
                    Ingatestone there was discovered in 1868 an almost unique fresco representation
                    of the seven deadly sins. The oldest brasses preserved in the county are those
                    of Sir William Fitz-Ralph at Pebmarsh, about 1323; Richard of Beltown, at
                    Corringham, 1340; Sir John Gifford, at Bowers Gifford, 1348; Ralph de ∙Kneyton,
                    at Aveley, 1370; Robert de Swynbourne, at Little Horkesley, 1391; and Sir
                    Ingelram de Bruyn, at South Ockendon, 1400. The brass of Thomas Heron, aged 14,
                    at Little Ilford, though dating only from 1517, is of interest as a picture of a
                    schoolboy of the period. Ancient wooden effigies are preserved at Danbury,
                    Little Leighs, and Little Horkesley.</p>
                <p>Essex was rich in monastic foundations, though the greater number have left but
                    meagre ruins behind. The Benedictines had an abbey at Saffron W <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> alden, nunneries at Barking and Wickes, and priories
                    at Monk's Colne and Hedingham; the Augustinian canons had an abbey at Waltham
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Waltham Abbey),</hi> priories at Thoby, Blackmore,
                    Bicknacre, Little Leighs, Little Dunmow, and St Osyth; there were Cistercian
                    abbeys at Coggeshall, Stratford, and Tilty; the Cluniae monks were settled at
                    Prittlewell, the Premonstratensians at Beleigh Abbey, and the Knights
                    Hospitallers at Little Maplestead. Barking Abbey is said to date its first
                    origin from the 7th century, the most of the others arose in the 12th and 13th
                    centuries. Besides the keep at Colchester there is a fine Norman castle at
                    Hedingham, and two dilapidated round towers still stand at Hadleigh. Ongar, the
                    house of the De Lacys, and PJeshy,the seat of the earls of Essex, have left only
                    mounds behind them. Havering, the palace that was occupied by so many of our
                    queens, is replaced by a modern house; Wickham, the mansion of the bishops of
                    London, is no more; and Theobald’s Park, the splendid creation of Lord Burleigh,
                    has shared the same fate. New Hall, which was successively occupied by Henry
                    VIII., Elizabeth, the earl of Essex, George Villiers duke of Buckingham, and
                    Cromwell, is now a nunnery of the order of the Holy Sepulchre. Audley End, the
                    mansion of Lord Braybrook, whose name is so well known in connexion with Essex
                    antiquities, is a noble example of the domestic architecture of the Jacobean
                    period; Layer Marney is an interesting proof of the Italian influences that were
                    at work in the time of Wolsey. Horeham Hall was built by Sir John Cutt in the
                    reign of Henry VII., and Gosfield Hall is of about the same date.</p>
                <p>Its position in the south-eastern corner of England, and its contiguity to the
                    metropolis, have given Essex no small prominence in the general history of
                    England. The Bomans of the first invasion (55 B c. ) received the nominal
                    submission of its British inhabitants, the Trinobantes, who also occupied
                    portions of what are now Middlesex, Suffolk, Hertfordshire, and Cambridge. We
                    have numismatic evidence of no inconsiderable civilisation among this tribe in
                    the following generation: Cunobelin or Cymbeline is well known from his coins,
                    and his son Caractacus is the great hero of the national defence against the
                    second Roman invasion. The defence, as is well-known, was futile: Camulodunum,
                    the Tnnobantian capital, was captured; and Aulus Plautius made it the seat of a
                    magnificent temple to the honour of Claudius the emperor. During the great
                    Boadicean rebellion, the Romans were driven from their post with terrible
                    slaughter, but they soon recovered their ground and rapidly colonized the
                    country. How thoroughly they took root can be read to this day in the relics
                    they have left. When the Saxons from over the sea began to make raids on the
                    decadent colony, Essex formed part of the domain of the count of the Saxon
                    Shore; and not long after the withdrawal of the Roman forces it was occupied by
                    the men whose name it still bears, the East Seaxa or East Saxons. Their separate
                    dynasty continued till <pb break="no"

                    rising power of Wessex, which was destined to widen into England. By the peace
                    of Wed more, Essex was recognized by Alfred as part of the Danish territory of
                    Gutlιrum, but the Danes were expelled by Alfred’s son, Edward the Elder. They
                    have probably left a few traces of their presence in such names as Danbury and
                    Dane-holes; but there is nardly a <hi rend="italic">by</hi> to be met with among
                    the numerous Saxon <hi rend="italic">fords, wealds, hams, thorps, burys,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ings.</hi> The futile attempt of Mellitus left the
                    Christianization of the East Saxons to Cedd, who is said to have formed churches
                    at Tilbury and Ithanceastre in the latter part of the 7th century. In 991 a
                    great battle was fought at Maldon against the Danes, made memorable for ever to
                    Englishmen by a Saxon song which celebrates the valour of Brihtnoth and his
                    peers; and it was probably at Ashington on the Crouch that in 1016 Cnut and
                    Edmund Ironside met in what the early chroniclers call the battle of Assandum In
                    1045 Essex was part of the earldom of Harold. The family of Swene of Essex, who
                    was in possession of a large part of the county at the time of the Conquest,
                    kept its ground for nearly a century. A new earldom created by Stephen was held
                    by the Mandevilles till 1227, passed by marriage to the Bohuns, and went with
                    the daughter of Humphrey de Bolιun to Thomas of Woodstock, son of Edward III.
                    Through his daughter it passed to William Bourchier, but the male line failed in
                    1540. The earldom was next assigned to Thomas Cromwell and William Parr, and
                    from 1571 tc 1646 it was held by the family of Devereux. Two years after the
                    death of the last earl, who had joined the Parliamentary party, the city of
                    Colchester was besieged and captured by the Parliamentary forces; and throughout
                    the struggle the people of Essex were mainly or. the popular side. After the
                    Bestoration, Arthur Capel was created Earl of Essex, and that family is still in
                    possession of the title. Of the celebrities of Essex it is sufficient to mention
                    Samuel Purchas, Joseph Mead, John Ray, Joseph Strutt, Philemon Holland, Dr
                    William Gilbert, Thomas Tusser, Francis Quarles, Thomas Gainsborough, and Dick
                    Turpin.</p>
