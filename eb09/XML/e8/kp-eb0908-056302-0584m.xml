                    party attempting to renew the litigation by a new action would be estopped by
                    the judgment. “Every judgment is conclusive proof as against parties and
                    privies, of facts directly in issue in the case, actually decided by the court,
                    and appearing from the judgment itself to be the ground on which it was
                    based.”—Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">Digests of the Law of Evidence,</hi> Art. 4L
                    (2.) It is one of the privileges of <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> as
                    distinguished from simple contracts that they operate by way of estoppel. “A man
                    shall always be estopped by his own deed, or not permitted to aver or prove
                    anything in contradiction to what he has once so solemnly and deliberately
                    avowed” (Blackstone, 2 <hi rend="italic">Com.,</hi> 295); <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> where a bond recited that the defendants were authorized by Acts of
                    Parliament to borrow money, and that under such authority they had borrowed
                    money from a certain person, they were estopped from setting up as a d.fence
                    that they did not in fact so borrow money,as stated by their deed. (3.) Estoppel
                    <hi rend="italic">in pais</hi> is the most important head. The rule practically
                    comes to this that, when a person in his dealings with others has acted so as to
                    induce them to believe a thing to be true and to act on such belief, he may not
                    in any proceeding between himself and them deny the thing to be true; <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a partner retiring from a firm without giving notice to
                    the customers, cannot, a3 against a customer having no knowledge of his
                    retirement, deny that he is a partner. As between landlord and tenant the
                    principle operates to prevent the denial by the tenant of the landlord’s title.
                    So if a person comes upon land by the licence of the person in possession, he
                    cannot deny that the licenser had a title to the possession at the time the
                    licence was given. Again, if a man accepts a bill of exchange he may not deny
                    the signature or the capacity of the drawer. So a person receiving goods as
                    baillee from another, cannot deny the title of that other to the goods at the
                    time they were entrusted to him.</p>
