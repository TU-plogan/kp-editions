                    and philosophy from 1826-31. As early as 1830, Eötvös commenced his literary
                    career by a translation of Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Goetz vοn
                    Berlichingen,</hi> followed shortly afterwards by two original comedies and a
                    tragedy <hi rend="italic">Boszü</hi><hi rend="italic">(Revenge),</hi> which
                    showed a singular beauty of style. In 1833, after having passed the requisite
                    examinations at Pozsony (Pressburg), he began at the early age of twenty his
                    official career as a vice-notary, which position he held for two years. He then
                    went to Vienna, where he was employed at -the Hungarian chancellory; here,
                    however, he only remained for a short time. In 1836 he commenced a long journey
                    with the object of visiting the chief towns of Germany, Holland, France, and
                    England, and did not return to Hungary before 1837. Shortly after this he was
                    appointed to a seat in the district court of justice at Eperies, which office he
                    soon resigned, withdrawing to his grandfather’s estate at Sälyi, where for some
                    time he devoted himself to literary studies. His dramatic works had meanwhile
                    attracted the attention of the Kisfaludy society, of which learned body he was
                    elected a member in the year 1835. But he reached the zenith of his fame as an
                    author in the year 1838, when his novel <hi rend="italic">Karthawd (The
                    Carthusian)</hi> appeared in the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Arυizkonyv</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Inunda-</hi><hi rend="italic">tion-BooT),</hi> of which he was
                    himself the editor, and which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n475/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0475-0456"/> was published betweeu 1838 and 1841 at Pesth, for
                    the benefit of the sufferers from the floods which devastated that city in 1838.
                    The articles comprised in this work, which extended to five volumes, were
                    contributed by various distinguished literary men, amongst whom Eötvös, as
                    having written the longest and most important article, occupies a conspicuous
                    place. In recognition of his literary merit he was in 1839 elected a member of
                    the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the year 1840 Eötvös, having removed from
                    Sâlyi to Buda, took his seat in the Upper House of the Hungarian Diet, and
                    identified himself with the advanced political movement of that period, aiding
                    his eloquence by his writings. Among the many important works which emanated
                    from his pen at this time, one entitled <hi rend="italic">Λ Falu Jegyzoje (The
                    Village Notary),</hi> which appeared in 1845, demands especial attention. In
                    this work the author vividly depicts the abuses of the old system of public
                    administration in Hungary by county elections; and the vigour of the narrative,
                    combined with the humorous and political character of the incidents related,
                    have caused it to be considered as one of the best national tales in the whole
                    circle of European literature. An English translation of this romance by Otto
                    Wenckstern, with an introduction by F. Pulszky, to whom the original was
                    dedicated, appeared in 1850; and there is also an excellent German translation
                    by Count J. Mailâth. The <hi rend="italic">Notary</hi> was followed in 1847 by
                    an historical romance of the 16th century, <hi rend="italic">Magyarorszag</hi>
                    1514 <hi rend="italic">ben,</hi> translated afterwards into German under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Bauernkrieg</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> this work
                    struck the keynote of that emancipation of the peasantry which was virtually
                    effected in 1848. In fact, the reforms which from time to time were introduced
                    into the Hungarian constitution must be in a great measure ascribed to the
                    political and literary labours of Eötvös. His work <hi rend="italic">Reform</hi>
                    was a collection of articles which he had previously contributed to one of the
                    leading Hungarian newspapers, the <hi rend="italic">Pesti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirlap.</hi></p>
                <p>Upon the formation of the first responsible Hungarian ministry on the 15th March
                    1848, Baron Eötvös received the portfolio of minister of public instruction; but
                    on the 28th September he was obliged to relinquish that post, in consequence of
                    the assassination of Lamberg, the Austrian governor of Hungary. He then
                    proceeded to Vienna, and subsequently to Munich, returning to Pesth in 1851.
                    Soon after his return he published an important political treatise, both in
                    Hungarian and German, entitled <hi rend="italic">Λ</hi><hi rend="italic">XIX.
                    szazad uralkodo eszmeinek befolydsa az alladalomra (The Influence of the Ruling
                    Ideas of the</hi> 19&lt;Λ <hi rend="italic">Century on the State).</hi> By this
                    work, and others of a similar tendency, he was instrumental in preparing the
                    popular mind for those constitutional changes which were afterwards so
                    beneficially introduced; and when, in 1867, the second Hungarian ministry was
                    called into existence, Eötvös was again entrusted with the portfolio of minister
                    of public instruction. Already in the year 1855 he had been elected
                    vice-president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and in 1866 he attained the
                    high honour of president. He died on the 2d February 1871, after a few weeks’
                    illness, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.</p>
