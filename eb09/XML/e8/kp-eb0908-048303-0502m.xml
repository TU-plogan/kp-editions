                    was conterminous on the landward side with Illyria, Macedonia, and Thessaly—thus
                    corresponding to the southern portion of Albania. The name Epirus <hi
                    rend="italic">("Ήπειρος,</hi> or in the local dialects “Απειρος) signified
                    mainland, and was originally applied to the whole coast southward to the
                    Corinthian gulf, in contradistinction to the neighbouring islands, Corcyra,
                    Leucas, &amp;c. The country is all more or less mountainous, especially towards
                    the east, where the Pindus chain, in its main massif of Lacmon, feeds the
                    fountains of nearly all the great rivers of Northern Greece,—the Peneus, the
                    Achelous, the Arachthus, and the Aous. In ancient times it did not produce corn
                    sufficient for the wants of its inhabitants; but it was celebrated, as it has
                    been almost to the present day, for its cattle and its horses. According to
                    Theopompus, a writer of the fourth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the
                    Epirots were divided into fourteen independent tribes, of which the principal
                    were the Chaones, the Thesproti, and the Molossi. The Chaones, identified by one
                    theory with the Chones who dwelt on the Tarentine gulf in Italy, inhabited the
                    northern portion of the country along the Acroceraunian shore, the Molossians
                    the inland district of which the lake of Pambotis or Yannina may be regarded as
                    the centre, and the Thesprotians the region to the north of the Ambracian gulf.
                    Aristotle places in Epirus the original home of the Hellenes, though the common
                    opinion among his countrymen traced them rather to Thessaly. In any case Epirus,
                    in spite of its distance from the chief centres of Greek thought and action, and
                    the fact that its inhabitants were hardly regarded as other than barbarians,
                    exerted even at an early period no small influence on Greece, by means more
                    especially of the oracle of Dodona. One of the earliest and most flourishing
                    settlements of the Greeks proper in Epirus λvas the Corinthian colony of
                    Ambracia, which give its name to the neighbouring gulf. The happy results of the
                    experiment appear to have tempted other Greek states to imitate the example, and
                    Elatria, Bucheta, and Pandosia bore witness to the enterprise of the people of
                    Elis. Among the other towns in the country the following were of some importance
                    :— in Chaonia—Palaeste and Chimaera, fortified posts to which the dwellers in
                    the open country could retire in time of war; Onchesmus or Anchiasmus, now
                    represented by Santi Quarante, or <hi rend="italic">ή σκάλα των</hi> 'Αγιων
                    Σάραντα, the Harbour of the Forty Saints; Phoenice, still so called, the
                    wealthiest of all the native cities of Epirus, and after the fall of the
                    Molossian kingdom the centre of an Epirotic League; Buthroton, the modern
                    Butrinto; Phanote, well known from its connection with the wars of the Romans;
                    and Hadrianopolis, founded by the emperor whose name it bore; in Thesprotia—the
                    Elean settlements already mentioned; Cassope, the <hi rend="italic">chef

                    Ephyra, afterwards Cichy-rus, a very ancient site, identified by Leake with the
                    monastery of St John three or four miles from Phanari, but by Bursian with the
                    ruins on the hill of K astri at the northern <pb break="no"

                    Molossia—Passaron, where the kings were wont to take the oath of the
                    constitution and receive their people’s allegiance; and Tecmon, Phylace, and
                    Horreum, all of doubtful identification. The Byzantine town of Rogus is probably
                    the same as the modern Luro, formerly known as Oropus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The kings or rather chieftains of the
                    Molossians, who ultimately extended their power over all Epirus, claimed to be
                    descended from Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, who, according to the legend, settled
                    in the country after the sack of Troy, and transmitted his kingdom to Molossus,
                    his son by Andromache. The early history of the dynasty is very obscure; but
                    Admetus, who lived in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> has become
                    famous for his hospitable reception of the banished Themistocles, in spite of
                    the grudge that he must have harboured against the great Athenian, who had
                    persuaded his countrymen to refuse the alliance tardily offered by the Molossian
                    chief when their victory against the Persians was already secured. He was
                    succeeded about 429 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by his son or grandson,
                    Tharymbas or Arymbas I. who being placed by a decree of the people under the
                    guardianship of Sabylinthus, chief of the Atintanes, was educated at Athens, and
                    thus became at a later date the introducer of a higher kind of civilization
                    among his subjects. Alcetas, the next king mentioned in history, was
                    contemporary with Dionysius of Syracuse (about 385 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> and was indebted to his assistance for the recovery of his throne.
                    His son Arymbas II. (who succeeded by the death of his brother Neoptolemus)
                    ruled with prudence and equity, and gave encouragement to literature and the
                    arts. To him Xenocrates of Chalcedon dedicated his four books on the art of
                    governing; and it is specially mentioned that he bestowed great care on the
                    education of his brother’s children. Troas, one of his nieces, became his own
                    wife; and Olympias, the other, was married to Philip of Macedon, and had the
                    honour of givipg birth to Alexander the Great. On the death of Arymbas, his
                    nephew Alexander, the brother of Olympias, was put in possession of the throne
                    by the assistance of Philip, who was afterwards assassinated on occasion of the
                    marriage of the youthful king with his daughter Cleopatra. Alexander was the
                    first who bore the title of King of Epirus, and he raised the reputation of his
                    country amongst foreign nations. His assistance having been sought by the
                    Tarentines against the Samnites and Lucanians, he made a descent, 332 B.o., at
                    Paestum, near the mouth of the river Silarus, and reduced several cities of the
                    Lucaui and Bruttii; but in a second attack upon Italy he was surrounded by the
                    enemy, defeated, and slain, near the city Pandosia, in the Bruttian
                    territory.</p>
                <p>Aeacides, the son of Arymbas IL, succeeded Alexander, and espoused the cause of
                    Olympias against Cassander; but he was dethroned by his own soldiers, and had
                    hardly regained his position when he fell, 313 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    in battle against Philip, brother of Cassander. He had, by his wife Phthia, the
                    celebrated Pyrrhus, and two daughters, Deidamia and Troas, of whom the former
                    married Demetrius Poliorcetes. His brother Alcetas, who succeeded him, continued
                    the war with Cassander till he was defeated; and he was ultimately put to death
                    by his rebellious subjects, 295 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The name of
                    Pyrrhus, who next ascended the throne, gives to the history of his country an
                    importance which it would never have otherwise possessed; but for an account of
                    his life we must refer to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrrhus.</hi></p>
                <p>Alexander, his son, who succeeded in 272 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    attempted to seize on Macedonia, and defeated Antigonus Gonatas, but was himself
                    shortly afterwards driven from his kingdom'by Demetrius. He recovered it,
                    however, and spent the rest of his days in peace. Two other insignificant reigns
                    brought the family of Pyrrhus to its close, and Epirus was thenceforward
                    governed by a praetor, elected annually in a general assembly of the nation held
                    at Passaron. It imprudently espoused the cause of Perseus in his ill-fated war
                    against the Romans, 168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>;' and it was consequently
                    exposed to the fury of the conquerors, who destroyed, it is said, 70 towns, and
                    carried into slavery 150,000 of the inhabitants. It never recovered from this
                    blow. At the dissolution of the Achaean league, 146 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> it became part of the province of Macedonia, receiving the name
                    Epirus Vetus, to distinguish it from Epirus Nova, which lay to the east.</p>
                <p>On the division of the empire it became the inheritance of the emperors of the
                    East, and remained under them until the taking of Constantinople by the Latins,
                    in 1204, when Michel Angelus Comnenus seized on Aetolia and Epirus. On the death
                    of Michel in 1216, these countries fell into the hands of his brother Theodore.
                    Thomas, the last of the direct line, was murdered in 1318 by his nephew Thomas,
                    lord of Zante and Cephalonia, and his dominions were dismembered. Not long
                    after, Epirus was overrun by the Samians and Albanians, and the confusion which
                    had been growing since the division of the empire was worse confounded still.
                    Charles II. Tocco, lord of Cephalonia and Zante, obtained the recognition of his
                    title of despot of Epirus from the emperor Manuel Comnenus, in the beginning of
                    the 15th century; but his family was deprived of their possession in 1431 by
                    Amurath II. In 1443, Scanderbeg, king of Albania, made himself master of a
                    considerable part of Epirus; but on his death it fell into the power of the
                    Venetians, from whom it passed again to the Turks, under whose domination it
                    still remains.</p>
