                    Observatory of Seeberg, near Gotha. In 1822-3 he published at Gotha two volumes,
                    entitled Die Entfernung der Sonne, in which the various observations of the
                    transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 were carefully reconsidered, and the
                    calculations verified and corrected. One of the earliest subjects to which his
                    attention was directed was the determination of the orbit of the comet observed
                    by Pons at Marseilles in November 1818. He calculated the period of its
                    recurrence at about three and a quarter years, and conjectured it to be the same
                    comet that nad appeared in 1786, 1795, and 1805. Upon the data he possessed he
                    was able to predict its reappearance in 1822, and he stated also that it would
                    probably be invisible in Europe. His prediction was almost exactly verified, the
                    comet being observed in New South Wales on the 3d June 1822, and the time of its
                    perihelion passage being within three hours of that which lie had computed. From
                    the elements supplied by this observation he was able to foretell more
                    accurately its recurrences in 1825 and 1828, and after the latter of these he
                    determined its exact orbit. After the observation of 1832 he determined the
                    period of its revolution as 3 ’ 29 years, with a gradual acceleration which he
                    ascribed to the existence of a resisting medium. The comet is known as Encke’s
                    comet. In 1825 Encke was appointed to succeed Bode as director of the Royal
                    Observatory at Berlin, a situation which he filled with great ability until
                    within a year of his death. In 1830 he became editor of the Berlin
                    Astronomisches Jahrbuch, to which he contributed a large number of valuable
                    papers. The observations taken under his direction at the Berlin Observatory
                    were recorded and published in a series of volumes, of which the first appeared
                    in 1840. Of his many other contributions to astronomical literature may be
                    mentioned his new method for computing perturbations, his dissertation De
                    Formulis Dioptricis (1845), and his work on the relation of astronomy to the
                    other sciences, which was published in 1846. Enckθ was one of the foreign
                    members of the Royal Society of London, and in 1840 he was created a knight by
                    the king of Prussia. He died at Spandau on September 2, 1865.</p>
