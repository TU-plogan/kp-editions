                    travelled jurisconsult of Biscayan origin, who held high office under the
                    emperor Charles V., his mother obtained a place in the household of the empress
                    Isabella, and the boy was brought up as a page to Philip, the heir-apparent. In
                    this capacity Ercilla visited the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, and was
                    present in 1554 at the betrothal of his master to Mary of England. Hearing while
                    he was in London that an expedition was about to start for South America in
                    order to chastise the revolted Araucanians of Chili, he asked and obtained
                    permission to join the adventurers. In the war which ensued he fought bravely
                    and well; but having through an accidental quarrel with a comrade fallen under
                    suspicion of mutiny, he was condemned to death by his general, Garcia de
                    Mendoza, and only escaped, on the discovery of his comparative innocence, with a
                    term of imprisonment. He returned to Spain in 1562, and in the course of the
                    next eight years visited Italy, France, Germany, Bohemia, &amp;c. At Madrid in
                    1570 he married Maria de Bazan, connected with the Santa Cruz family; in 1570 he
                    was made knight of the order of Santiago; in 1576 he was appointed chamberlain
                    to the emperor Rudolph II.; and in 1578 he was employed by Philip II. on a
                    mission to Saragossa. After several years of poverty and neglect, he died at
                    Madrid about 1595. His principal and, indeed, his almost solitary work is <hi
                    rend="italic">La Araucaria,</hi> a poem based on the events of the wars in which
                    he had been engaged. It consists of three parts, of which the first, composed
                    between 1555 and 1563, and published in 1569, is a versified narrative adhering
                    strictly to fact and date; the second, published in 1578, is relieved or
                    encumbered by visions and other romantic machinery; and the third, which
                    appeared in 1590, contains, in addition to the subject proper, a variety of
                    episodes relevant and irrelevant. Of symmetry or proportion this so-called epic
                    is almost destitute; but it is written in excellent Spanish, and is full of
                    passages of vigorous and natural description. Cervantes placed it on a level
                    with some of the best Italian poems of its class; Voltaire spoke iu warm terms
                    of certain portions; and it is now acknowledged to occupy an honourable position
                    in Spanish literature. It has been frequently reprinted,—at Madrid in 1776 and
                    1828, and again in 1851, as part of Rivadeneyra’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bιblio-teca.</hi> An analysis of the poem was given by Hayley in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Epic Poetry,</hi> 1782; and another appeared in <hi
                    rend="italic">Charaktere der Vornehmsten Dichter aller Nationen,</hi> Leipsic,
                    1793. A French abridgment was published by Gilbert de Marlhiac in 1824; a German
                    translation by Winterling at Nuremberg, 1831; and a complete French translation
                    at Paris by Al. Nicolas, 1870.</p>
