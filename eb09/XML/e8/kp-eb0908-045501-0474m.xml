                    known as the Chevalier d’Eon, a political adventurer, was born at Tonnerre, in
                    Burgundy, on the 5th October 1728. He was the son of an advocate of good
                    position, and after a distinguished course of study at the Collège Mazarin, he
                    became a doctor of law by special dispensation before the usual age, and adopted
                    his father’s profession. He commenced literary work as a contributor to Fréron’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Année Littéraire,</hi> and attracted notice as a political
                    writer by two works on financial and administrative questions, which he
                    published in his twenty-fifth year. His reputation increased so rapidly that in
                    1755 he was, on the recommendation of the prince of Conti, entrusted by Louis
                    XV. with a secret mission to the court of Russia. It was on this occasion that
                    he for the first time assumed the dress of a woman, with the connivance, it is
                    supposed, of the French court. In this disguise he obtained the appointment of
                    reader to the empress Elizabeth, and won her over entirely to the views of his
                    royal master, with whom he maintained a secret correspondence during the whole
                    of his diplomatic career. After a year’s absence he returned to Paris to be
                    immediately charged with a second mission to St Petersburg, in which he figured
                    in his true sex, and as brother of the reader who had been at the Russian court
                    the year before. He played an important part in the negotiations between the
                    courts of Russia, Austria, and France during the Seven Years’ War. For these
                    diplomatic services he was rewarded with the decoration of the grand cross of St
                    Louis. In 1759 he served with the French army on the Rhine as aide-de-camp to
                    the Marshal de Broglie, and was wounded during the campaign. He had held for
                    some years previously a commission in a regiment of dragoons, aud was
                    distinguished for his skill in military exercises, particularly in fencing. In
                    1762, on the return of the Duc de Nivernais, Eon, who had been secretary to his
                    embassy, was appointed his successor, first as resident agent and then as
                    minister plenipotentiary at the court of Great Britain. He had not been long in
                    this position when he lost the favour of his sovereign, chiefly, according to
                    his own account, through the adverse influence of Madame de Pompadour, who was
                    jealous of him as a secret correspondent of the king. Superseded by Count
                    Guerchy, Eon showed his irritation by denying the genuineness of the letter of
                    appointment, and by raising an action against Guerchy for an attempt to poison
                    him. Guerchy, on the other hand, had previously commenced an action against Eon
                    for libel, founded on the publication by the latter of certain state documents
                    of which he had possession in his official capacity. Both parties succeeded in
                    so far as a true bill was found against Guerchy for the attempt to murder,
                    though by pleading his privilege as ambassador he escaped a trial, and Eon was
                    found guilty of the libel. Failing to come up for judgment when called on, he
                    was outlawed. For some years afterwards he lived in obscurity, appearing in
                    public chiefly at fencing matches. During this period rumours as to the sex of
                    Eon, originating probably in the story of his first residence at St Petersburg
                    as a female, began to excite public interest. Bets were frequently laid on the
                    subject, and an action raised before Lord Mansfield in 1777 for the recovery of
                    one of these bets brought the question to a judicial decision, by which Eon was
                    declared a female. A month after the trial he returned to France, having
                    received permission to do so as the result of negotiations in which Beaumarchais
                    was employed as agent. The conditions were that he was to deliver up certain
                    state documents in his possession, aud to wear the dress of a female. The reason
                    for the latter of these stipulations has never been clearly explained, but he
                    complied with it to the close of his life. In 1784 he received permission to
                    visit London for the purpose of bringing back his library and other property. He
                    did not, however, return to France, though after the Revolution he sent a
                    letter, using the name of Madame d’Eon, in which he offered to serve in the
                    republican army. He died in London on the 22d May 1810. During the closing years
                    of his life he is said to have enjoyed a small pension from George III. A
                    postmortem examination of the body conclusively established the fact that Eon
                    wa3 a man.</p>
