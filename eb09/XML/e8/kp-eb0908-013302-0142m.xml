                    the temple of Shiloh, the sanctuary of the ark, and at the same time judge over
                    Israel—an unusual combination of offices, which must have been won by signal
                    services to the nation in his earlier years, though in the history preserved to
                    us he appears in the weakness of extreme old age, unable to control the

                    sanctuary and disgusted the people. While the central authority was thus
                    weakened, the Philistines advanced against Israel, aud gained a complete victory
                    in the great battle -of Ebenezer, where the ark was taken, and Hophni and
                    Phinehas slain. On hearing the news, Eli fell from his seat and died. According
                    to the Massoretic text, he was ninety-eight years old, and had judged Israel for
                    forty years (1 Sam. iv. 15, 18). The Septuagint translator gives but twenty
                    years in ver. 18, and seems not to have read ver. 15 [Wellhausen in loco]. After
                    these events the sanctuary of Shiloh appears to have been destroyed by the
                    Philistines [comp. Jer. vii.; Ewald, Geschichte, ii. 584; Wellhausen on 2 Sam.
                    viii. 17], and the descendants of Eli with the whole of their clan or “father’s
                    house” subsequently appear as settled at Nob (1 Sam. xxi. 1, xxii. 11 sqq.,
                    comp. xiv. 3). In the massacre of the clan by Saul, with the subsequent
                    deposition of the survivor Abiathar from the priestly office (1 Kings ii. 27),
                    the prophecies of judgment uttered in the days of Eli against his corrupt house
                    were strikingly fulfilled (1 Sam. ii. 27 sqq., iii. 11 sqqj).<note

                <p>An important point of Hebrew archaeology is involved in the genealogy of Eli and
                    his house. It appears from</p>
                <p>1 Kings ii. 27-35 that Zadok, from whom the later high priests claimed descent,
                    and who appears in 1 Chron. v 38 (E. V. vi. 12) as the lineal descendant of
                    Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas, was not of the house of Eli, and in 1 Chron.
                    xxiv. Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, is reckoned to the sons of Ithamar, the
                    younger branch of the house of Aaron. Hence the traditional view that in the
                    person of Eli the high-priesthood was temporarily diverted from the line of
                    Eleazar and Phinehas into that of Ithamar [comp. Joseph. Ant. c. 11, § 5, v.
                    viii. c. 1, § 3, and for the fancies of the Rabbins on the cause of this
                    diversion, Selden, De Succ. in Poηtif., lib. i. cap. 2]. This view, however,
                    seems to be absolutely inconsistent with 1 Sam. ii., which represents Eli’s
                    “father’s house” or clan as the original priestly family, and predicts the
                    destruction or degradation to an inferior position of the whole of this
                    “father’s house,” and not merely of the direct descendants of Eli. Moreover,
                    Ahimelech, who is the only link to connect Eli with Ithamar, is an ambiguous
                    personage, who, perhaps, owes his existence to a corruption in the text of</p>
                <p>2 Sam. viii. 17 [comp. Wellhausen in loco; Graf, Ge schichtliche Bucher, p. 2371,
                    where most recent critics read, and the history seems to require, “Abiathar son
                    of Ahimelech” [comp, however, Bertheau on 1 Chron. xviιi. 16, and Keil on 1
                    Chron. v.]. To build an elaborate theory on the genealogical statements in
                    Chronicles is the less justifiable because that book wholly ignores the
                    priesthood of Eli, while Hebrew genealogies must sometimes be understood in a
                    figurative sense. Compare further on the whole subject, Thenius and Wellhausen,
                    on 1 Sam. ii.; Ewald’s Geschichte, ii. p. 576 sqq.; Graf, “Zur Geschichte des
                    Stammes Levi” in Merx’s Archiv, i. pp. 79, 88, and among older writers
                    especially Selden, in his book already cited, De Successione in Pontificatum.
