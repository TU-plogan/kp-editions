                <p><label type="entry">EXCHANGE</label>. The system by which commercial nations
                    discharge their debts to each other has been termed “Exchange,” or “the
                    Exchanges.” It has been subject of much study both by merchants and bankers who
                    have to deal with its phenomena in the course of business, aud by economists
                    desirous to discover the causes of the phenomena, and to explain the laws or
                    method of their operation. In rude times the people of neighbouring countries
                    brought their staple or surplus produce to common fairs, where one kind of goods
                    was valued and bartered for another; and the dealers brought a little gold and
                    silver with them to settle the small balances. But this, though a rough type of
                    international trade still, is a wholly different affair from modern commerce,
                    with its transactors multiplied a millionfold, and conducting their transactions
                    far apart in widely distant countries. Money itself does little to obviate the
                    difficulties arising from this multiplicity of crossing and recrossing currents;
                    and whoever, therefore, was the first introducer of the idea of “Exchange” is
                    entitled to a high place in the commercial annals of the world—whether it was
                    the stranger mentioned by Isocrates, who came to Athens with some cargoes of
                    corn, and gave an order on a town on the Euxine where money was owing to him,
                    with recourse on an Athenian merchant in the event of the order being
                    dishonoured; or Cicero, in paying for the studies of his son at Athens by an
                    assignment from a creditor in Rome on his debtor in the Greek city; or the pope,
                    whose lending merchants of Siena and Florence drew upon Henry III., or rather on
                    the prelates and abbots of England, with some English merchants as remitters,
                    for the expenses of deposing Manfred, king of Sicily, in which act of deposition
                    Henry was an interested and obligant party—thus avoiding in these various cases
                    the difficulty and risk of transporting coin. The idea, w herever first
                    exemplified, was too good to be lost. It was early developed into a system in
                    Venice, later in Amsterdam, and is now of world-wide application.</p>
                <p>It is well to observe, first, what is exchanged—values of commodities exported
                    and sold from one place or country to another, debts thereby owing, interest,
                    profits of capital invested abroad, foreign loans and subsidies, freights,
                    banking and other commissions, expenses of foreign residence or travel, and, in
                    short, claims of payment of every kind on one part, having their relative
                    obligations of remittance on the other, and originally denominated, as the
                    contract or the occasion may have been, in the money either of the places from
                    which the claims proceed or of those where they are payable. Secondly, the means
                    must be noticed by which the exchange is effected—pieces of paper, bearing
                    express calculation to secure what is exactly due between debtor and creditor. A
                    bill of exchange is an order drawn for a specified and definite sum, in favour
                    of a person who is the buyer and becomes the “remitter” of the order, upon a
                    third person, the “drawee,” who is indebted for this sum to the drawer, and on
                    presentation of the order becomes the “acceptor.” The person or company in whose
                    favour the order is drawn may pass it into other hands, and these, by writing
                    their names on the back, become “indorsers.” On much the same model there are
                    “inland” and “foreign” bills of exchange. The whole system of exchange has its
                    foundation in the drawing of the creditor on the debtor; for, as in every
                    country there are both creditors and debtors of other countries, the debtors
                    find it to their advantage to take up the drafts of the creditors in order to
                    avoid direct remittances in cash.</p>
                <p>Inland exchange is simpler in character and more easily comprehended than foreign
                    exchange, but in reality presents the same phenomena and the same sequence of
                    cause and effect as the other, so far as the circumstances of any country allow
                    these to come into operation.</p>
                <p>Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Culloch, in the article on “Exchange.” in
                    former editions of the present work, gave a familiar exposition of inland
                    exchange, which it would be difficult to improve:—</p>
                <p>“If the debts reciprocally due by London and Glasgow be equal, whether they
                    amount to £100,000, £500,000, or any other sum, they may be discharged without
                    the intervention of money, and the price of bills of exchange will be ‘ at Par;’
                    that is, a sum of £100 or £1000 in Glasgow will purchase a bill for £100 or
                    £1000 payable in London, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> But if these
                    cities be not mutually indebted in equal sums, then the price of bills will be
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n820/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0820-0785"/> increased in the city which has the greatest
                    number of payments tc make, and reduced in tlιat which has the fewest. If
                    Glasgow owe Loudon £100,000, whilst the latter only owes the former £90,000, it
                    is clear, inasmuch as Glasgow has a larger sum to remit to London than London
                    has to remit to Glasgow, that the price of bills on London will rise in Glasgow
                    because of the increased demand, and that the price of bills on Glasgow will
                    fall in London because of the diminished demand. A larger sum would consequently
                    be required to discharge a debt due by Glasgow to London, and a less sum to
                    discharge an equal debt due by the latter to the former; or, which is the same
                    thing, the exchange would be <hi rend="italic">in favour of</hi> London, and <hi
                    rend="italic">against</hi> Glasgow. Bills on London would sell in Glasgow at a
                    <hi rend="italic">premium,</hi> and bills on Glasgow would sell in London at a
                    <hi rend="italic">discount;</hi> the premium in the one case being equal to the
                    discount in the other.</p>
                <p>“On the supposition that the balance of £10,000, due by Glasgow, depresses the
                    exchange on London <hi rend="italic">one per cent.,</hi> it appears, at first
                    sight, that it will cost Glasgow £101,000 to discharge her debt of £100,000 due
                    to London; and that, on the other hand, £89,100 would be sufficient to discharge
                    the debt of London to Glasgow. But a very little consideration will serve to
                    show that this would not be the case. Exchange transactions cannot take place
                    between different cities until debtors and creditors of the one reside in the
                    other. And hence, when the exchange became unfavourable to Glasgow, the premium
                    paid by its merchants for bills on London would not go into the pockets of their
                    creditors in the latter, but into those of their neighbours in Glasgow’ to whom
                    London was indebted, and from whom the bills were purchased. The loss to Glasgow
                    would, therefore, be limited to thepreτn⅛m paid on the balance of £10,000. Thus,
                    supposing that A of Glasgow owes D of London £100,000, and that C of London ow
                    es B of Glasgow £90,000, A will pay to B £91,000 for a bill or order on C to pay
                    D £90,000. In this way the £90,000 of London debt at Glasgow would be cleared
                    off,—the premium, which is lost by the debtor to London in Glasgow, being gained
                    by its creditor in the same place. If the business had been transacted in
                    London, C, with £89,100, would have purchased of D a bill for £90,000, payable
                    by A; so that, in this case, the gain would have fallen to the share of the
                    debtor C, and the loss to that of the creditor D, both of London. The complexity
                    of real transactions does not affect the principles on which they are founded.
                    And whatever may be the amount of the debts reciprocally due by different
                    places, the only disadvantage under which any of them could be placed by a fall
                    of the exchange would be the unavoidable one of paying the expense of remitting
                    the <hi rend="italic">balance</hi> of debt.</p>
                <p>“The expense of transmitting money from one place to another limits the
                    fluctuations in the exchange between them. If 20s. sufficed to cover the expense
                    and risk attending the transmission of £100 from Glasgow to London, it would be
                    indifferent to a merchant, in the event of the exchange becoming unfavourable to
                    the former, whether he paid one per cent, <hi rend="italic">premium</hi> for a
                    bill on London, or remitted money direct to the latter. If the premium were less
                    than one per cent., it would be clearly his interest to make his payments by
                    means of bills rather than by remittances; and that it could not exceed one per
                    cent, is obvious, for every individual would rather directly remit money than
                    incur an unnecessary expense by purchasing bills on London at a greater <hi
                    rend="italic">premium</hi> than would suffice to cover the expense of a money
                    remittance. If, owing to the badness of roads, disturbances in the country, or
                    any other cause, the expense of remitting money from Glasgow to London were
                    increased, the difference in the rate of exchange between them might also be
                    proportionally increased. But in every case the extent to which this difference
                    could attain would be limited by, and could not for any considerable period
                    exceed, the cost of remitting cash.</p>
                <p>“Exchange transactions become more complex when one place, as is often the case,
                    discharges its debts to another by means of bills drawn on a third place. Thus,
                    though London should owe nothing to Glasgow, yet if Glasgow be indebted to
                    London, London to Manchester, and Manchester to Glasgow, the latter may wholly
                    or partially discharge her debt to London by remitting bills on Manchester. She
                    may wholly discharge it, provided the debt due to her by Manchester exceed or is
                    equal to the debt due by her to London. If, however, it be not equal to the
                    latter, Glasgow will either have to remit money to London to pay the balance of
                    debt, or bills on some other place indebted to her.</p>
                <p>“Transactions in inland bills of exchange are almost entirely conducted by
                    bankers, who charge a certain rate per cent, for their trouble, and who, by
                    means of their credit and connexions, are able, on all occasions, to supply the
                    demands of their customers. Bills on London drawn in Edinburgh and Glasgow were
                    formerly made payable at forty days’ date, which was equivalent to a <hi
                    rend="italic">premium</hi> of about ⅜ per cent.; but, owing to the greater
                    facility of communication, this <hi rend="italic">premium</hi> is now reduced to
                    twenty days’ interest, or to about ⅛ per cent. Bills for remitting the, revenue
                    from Scotland are now drawn at thirty days; previously to 1819 they were drawn
                    at sixty days.”</p>
                <p>The cost of remittance from Scotland to London has continued to fall during the
                    last thirty years. Bills on revenue account are now drawn at eleven days, free
                    of stamp, and bankers’ drafts at seven days, or at a charge of 2s. per .£100 up
                    to £300, 6s. for all sums between £300 and .£600, and Is. additional for every
                    £100 above £600. Ou the other hand, the Loudon bankers remit money, paid over
                    their counters to-day, to Scotland and other parts of the kingdom, payable at
                    par to-morrow. To this extent the rate of exchange is still adverse to Edinburgh
                    and Glasgow, and in favour of London. Tn like manner the holder of a bill of
                    exchange in Edinburgh or Glasgow upon London finds himself in a somewhat better
                    position than the holder of a bill in London upon either of the two Scotch
                    centres. Yet it would be an error to suppose that the balance of trade is
                    against Scotland and in favour of Englaud. The balance of value of commodities
                    exchanged between the two countries is in favour of Scotland, and might be
                    greatly in her favour, and yet the rate of exchange be adverse; so that we are
                    thus early admonished that the imports and exports of goods, though an
                    important, are not, as was long supposed, a decisive element in the rate of
                    exchange. The transmission of the revenue of Scotland (seven or eight millions
                    annually), the rental of owners of land having their chief domicile in the
                    metropolis, and the amount of obligations of Scotch merchants made payable in
                    London under the increasing concentration of monetary business, would be
                    sufficient to counteract the effect of a large balance of trade on the rate of
                    exchange. Hence London bankers, in taking money even in small sums payable at
                    par next day in Edinburgh or Glasgow, are simply taking before hand what is
                    already under course of remittance, and reducing <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tanto</hi> the balances to be remitted from Scotland.</p>
                <p>The relations of inland exchange just stated are those of a country where the
                    money is uniform; where the banknotes of Ireland and Scotland are payable on
                    demand in the common imperial standard of value, as the country banknotes of
                    England are similarly exchangeable for gold or for Bank of England notes, which
                    latter are orders for the deli very of so much gold in the issue department; and
                    where, consequently, all inland bills are drawn in precisely the same money. The
                    circumstances are thus higldy favourable to an even exchange; and it may be
                    conclusively held that the nearer the monetary system, -whether in separate
                    countries within themselves, or in nations closely related by com mercial and
                    financial transactions one with another, approaches to these conditions, the
                    difficulties and oscillations of exchange, inland and foreign, will be reduced
                    within narrower limits.</p>
                <p>The history of inland exchange in the three kingdoms presents abundaut proofs of
                    the immediate effect of money of differing values in disordering the exchanges,
                    or, in other words, the uniform payment of their debts one to another. In the
                    early days of Scotch banking, when the natural limit of a free legal issue of
                    notes was less understood than it soon became, and a structure of bills of
                    exchange was reared upon this basis, it was found that bullion had to be raised
                    by constant re-discounts in London, and that exchange, in short, became
                    impracticable. Even within the same town, given two kinds of money or currency,
                    one of superior value to another, a premium will be immediately established in
                    favour of the money of superior value, and will affect every transaction,
                    however small, by calculations of rate of exchange, as was long illustrated by
                    the <hi rend="italic">banco</hi> of Hamburg, a strict metallic money of given
                    weight and fineness, in its contact with the worn or degraded coins of various
                    mints in prevailing circulation. In 1689, when, by a proclamation of James IL,
                    one penny was added to the nominal value of the Irish shilling, £108, 6s. 8d.
                    Irish money became equal <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n821/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0821-0786"/> to only £100 of British money in the nominal par
                    of exchange, between Great Britain and Ireland, or a difference of 8∣ per cent,
                    against the latter. In the course of another century the monetary system of
                    Ireland and Great Britain had so far become uniform that the bank-notes of both
                    countries were payable on demand in gold, but the dilution of standard
                    proclaimed by James II. was still in force. In the eight years previous to 1797,
                    the date of the Bank Restriction Act suspending specie payments, the rate of
                    exchange between London and Dublin had ranged from 7∣ to 9 per cent., being from
                    ⅞ below to § per cent, above the par of exchange, as determined by the actual
                    value of the British and Irish money. The banks of England and Ireland were now
                    alike free to issue notes without legal liability to pay them in gold on demand;
                    and in 1803 the Bank of Ireland had increased its issues from £621,917 to
                    £2,707,956, being in the proportion of 1 to 4 3; while the Bank of England had
                    increased its issues in the same period from £9,181,843 to £16,505,272, or in
                    the proportion only of 1 to 1’8. The rate of exchange was then 17 per cent,
                    against Dublin, being 8g- per cent, more than the normal par. But in the seven
                    subsequent years the issues of the Bank of Ireland increased at the rate of 2£
                    per cent., and the issues of the Bank of England at the rate of 5 per cent.,
                    while the country bank issues of Ireland were much diminished in amount, and
                    those of England were largely increased. During this period the current rates of
                    exchange became more favourable to Dublin. The inconvertible paper currency of
                    Ireland had increased, -but it had not increased in nearly the same proportion
                    as the same kind of money in England. The manufacturers of Ulster, at once
                    disaffected against the Government and annoyed at the uncertain value of the
                    bank notes, clung to a gold currency; and while Dublin was under a discount of 8
                    per cent, in its exchange with London, Belfast was commanding a premium of 3 per
                    cent, against London, and 10 percent, against Dublin.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Apart, however, from this element of the differing standards and values of money,
                    which comes more fully into view under the head of “foreign exchange,” it is
                    impossible to follow closely the description of inland exchange above quoted
                    from Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Culloch without apprehending many of
                    the principal characteristics of the operation, which, as they are sure to arise
                    in exchange transactions under all circumstances, cannot be too soon brought
                    into formal notice; such as (1 ) that the rate of exchange is ruled by the
                    supply and demand of bills for the time being; (2) when in any market the demand
                    for bills on a given centre is greater than the supply, the deficiency may be
                    supplemented by bills on other centres having a favourable exchange with the
                    given centre—a resource which, though indirect, receives much extension in the
                    wide theatre of the commercial world under the watchful study of experts in
                    bills; (3) the profit of a premium and the loss of a discount on bills fall
                    within the market where the bill is drawn or sold, the drawee or acceptor having
                    the definite sum on the bill to pay in either case; (4) exchange between one
                    country or one centre and another is never a completed or perfectly adjusted
                    process, but a constant series of transactions, reflecting the varying phases of
                    claims and debts as they mature; and (5) the fluctuation of rates of exchange is
                    effectually limited by the expense of transmitting money, that is, coin or
                    bullion,-- a principle which, though subject to partial exceptions in foreign
                    exchange, is an underlying and potential law of the whole system.</p>
                <p>In the study of foreign exchange some embarrassment arises from the twofold
                    character of the action and its results, and the necessity of realizing in one
                    conception the drawers and buyers of the bills, and the two countries to which
                    their transactions apply. It tends to simplify the matter to remember that what
                    is transacted either in London or Paris expends the whole effect, for purposes
                    of comprehension at least, of the course of exchange between the two cities; and
                    so in other cases. If the debts, the time of settlement of which has come, of
                    London to Paris be greater than the debts of Paris to London, the supply of
                    bills on Paris in London will be less, and the supply of bills on London in
                    Paris will be greater than the demand, which are only different forms of
                    expressing the same relation. There may be a momentary variation in the rate of
                    exchange in the two cities, but as soon as the relation of supply is discovered
                    the variation will disappear. On both fields the same two classes of people,
                    drawers and remitters, are at work, only the party in stronger force on the one
                    is in weaker force on the other, and at both ends there is the same though
                    converse result. In any one market, therefore, there is a complete
                    representation of the action of exchange.</p>
                <p>To a circle of exchange four persons, as is explained by Mr Mill, are always
                    necessary: A, say of England, has exported English goods to B, say in France;
                    and in order that B may be saved the expense and risk of sending money to A, A
                    draws a bill on B for the sum due, and sells it to his neighbour D in England,
                    in order that he may send it instead of money to C in France, from whom D has
                    imported French goods of exactly equivalent value, and who, on the expiry of
                    days the bill has to run, takes it to his neighbour B, and gets his payment,
                    while in possession of the bill B has his discharge from A. The debt on both
                    sides is thus paid without the transmission of a single ounce of gold or
                    silver.</p>
                <p>This is a genuine circle of foreign exchange; but in the great commerce and
                    diversified creditorship and debtorship of the world the process is frequently
                    of a very complex kind. Not only all the exports and imports, freights, and
                    transit dues round the globe, but nearly all the public and private outlays
                    which one country expends upon another, are paid by means of foreign bills of
                    exchange. Mr Goschen, in a practical treatise which may be said to bring up the
                    science of exchange to the present time,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">The Theory of Foreign Exchanges,</hi> by
                    the Right Hon. G. J. Goschen, M.P., ninth edition, London, Effingham Wilson,
                    1876.</p></note> examines the various classes of foreign bills, and specifies
                    some movements of exchange which could hardly be dreamed of save by professional
                    men. For instance, teas shipped from China to New York are generally paid for by
                    a draft of the exporter on a London merchant for account of the American
                    importer. The exporter in China is paid by the price which is given him for his
                    bill on London; and the London acceptor looks for payment to the importer in New
                    York. In the East Indies those who ship produce to America draw on London and
                    not on New York; and the New Orleans cotton exporter to Russia draws on London
                    instead of on St Petersburg. The explanation of this may be partly that Great
                    Britain exports more in manufactures and silver to China, for example, than she
                    imports of Chinese tea and silk, and thus leaves a balance of trade due to her,
                    which the Chinese pay by transferring their claims on New York to their London
                    creditors, and partly from the greater reputation and custom of the London
                    banking houses than <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0822-0787"/> those of New York or St Petersburg, though many
                    of these may be no less wealthy than the others, or simply from the greater
                    convenience of a bill on London. In proportion, however, as direct trade in
                    mutual import and export of goods is established between two countries, direct
                    exchange follows. Formerly the New York houses drew, for their shipments of
                    tobacco and other produce to Bremen, on England for German account. But now
                    since German manufactures and products have been making progress in the New
                    World, bills of exchange aie drawn between New York and Bremen, and Rio Janeiro
                    and Hamburg. But the merchants of Bombay and other parts of India, finding few
                    purchasers of bills on Bremen, still draw on London for German account. These
                    indirect exchanges may be regarded as examples of the common expedient of
                    utilizing both debts and credits at various distant points in redressing the
                    inequalities of direct exchange; and, also, of the advantage of London, from the
                    greater extent of British commerce and the greater distribution of British
                    exports than those of any other country, as the centre for ultimate adjustments
                    and clearings of this kind. But Mr Goschen has adduced an extensive class of
                    foreign bills still more remarkable. These are bills “technically said to be
                    drawn in blank,” which represent no actual indebtedness at the period of
                    drawing, and by which the acceptor does not pay his debt to the drawer, but on
                    the contrary, the drawer incurs a debt to the acceptor. Mr Goschen admits that
                    they approach nearly to the character of accommodation bills in the home trade,
                    might be even worse abused, and consequently require to be discriminated. In
                    many cases such bills have a function of public utility,—as, for example, where
                    the imports of a country do not fall into the same period of the year as its
                    exports, and the bills in payment of them do not meet each other in the ordinary
                    course. In that case, the importers in seeking to buy bills on foreign countries
                    would not find them, and would have no recourse but to remit specie in payment
                    of their purchases abroad In like manner the exporters of grain, cotton, and
                    other produce might draw bills for their value, but would find the bills were
                    unsaleable, and would have to order the gold, remitted by the importers a few
                    months before, to be sent back again. In this situation banking-houses draw “in
                    blank” on bankers abroad, selling their drafts to importers at one period of the
                    year and buying the bills of the exporters at another, therewith to refund the
                    bankers abroad by whom their drafts have been honoured. The case implies a
                    raising of capital in anticipation of the produce, but there need be nothing
                    fictitious either in its manner or character, and it may well be believed to be
                    the case of many large producing countries and colonies. In the dealings of
                    foreign exchange the small as well as the large bills are embraced. With the
                    piles of single bills for many thousands of pounds sterling, from such countries
                    as China, India, or America, are commingled many bills of small amounts; while
                    from all parts of Europe they are of a still more miscellaneous character—bills
                    of retail as well as wholesale trade, bills of Swedish or Norwegian shipmasters
                    for freights, of Dutch and Belgian farmers for parcels of eggs and butter, of
                    Germans for toys, and French for odd <hi rend="italic">articles de Paris,</hi>
                    on minor agents, shopkeepers, milliners, and others, who may not have come in
                    the course of their business within the range of inland exchange.</p>
                <p>The developments of foreign exchange are always more or less modified in the
                    course of a generation, and so much seems necessary as an introduction to the
                    essential subject itself, and in particular to the explanation of the rate of
                    exchange, how it is determined, and what in a general sense it imports.</p>
                <p>Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Culloch, in former editions of this work,
                    treated foreign exchange under three heads :—(1) <hi rend="italic">nominal
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">change,</hi> or the rate of exchange established
                    between two countries on a strict estimate of the respective money, or coins, or
                    currencies, in which the value of their goods are usually denominated and
                    exchanged; (2) <hi rend="italic">real exchange,</hi> or the effect of the supply
                    and demand of bills in raising the current rate above, or depressing it below,
                    the mean point or equilibrium—nominal, inasmuch as it is an equal value from
                    which there is constant variation by other elements acting on the rate of
                    exchange, but yet of radical fixity and importance; and (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >computed exchange,</hi> or, in reality, the actual course of exchange as
                    determined day by day from the combined consideration and effects of the other
                    two. While this division was appropriate enough, it may be better here to
                    consider still more in detail the various elements entering into the valuation
                    of foreign bills or, in other words, the rate of foreign exchange. These may be
                    conveniently embraced under the following heads:—(1) par of exchange; (2) supply
                    and demand of bills; (3) rate of interest; (4) cost of specie remittance; to
                    which may be added, what is always implied, (5) correct judgment of the force
                    and duration of the cause or causes affecting the rate of exchange, or its
                    opposite, panic.</p>
                <p>1. Without some common medium of value in commercial countries, bills of exchange
                    could not be drawn between one and another. The “cash” of China has played no
                    more part in the foreign exchanges than the cowries of Africa; but since a mint
                    has been established in Japan, from which gold pieces are issued under public
                    regulation as to weight and fineness, there may be no difficulty in ascertaining
                    the monetary equivalency, at Yokohama, of any debt due by Japan to England, or
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The nations have thus found a medium of
                    exchange in bullion, in gold or silver, or in both. In countries of the double
                    standard, it has been usual to modify the law by liberty of contract for payment
                    in one of the metals, without which liberty, indeed, it would be as well to have
                    only one standard, since it is certain that the debtor will always choose to pay
                    in the metal that has become relati vely cheaper. In countries where silver is
                    the sole standard, the par of silver to gold may be 15 to 1, or 16 to 1, as law
                    or custom may have established; but in foreign exchange the par of silver to
                    gold cannot be fixed at any absolute point by the law of any one country, and in
                    the case of a depreciation, say of silver, even though temporary, by which the
                    market price of silver to gold became 17 to 1, a proportionate addition would be
                    made to the figures of the mint or former customary par, and this new sum become
                    practically the par of exchange between the gold currency of England or
                    California and the silver dollars of Mexico or rupees of India. Thus, having
                    gold and silver to deal with, it is always possible, whatever may be the variety
                    and names of the coins of different countries, to estimate the equivalents of
                    the one to the other This is a matter simply of Veight and assay; and the ratio
                    thus found is the par of exchange between one country and another.</p>
                <p>Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Culloch seems to have thought that the par of
                    exchange should properly include, not only equivalent weight and purity of the
                    precious metals, but their relative cheapness or dearness in given places.
                    “Thus,” he says, “if, because of the expense of carriage, the value of bullion
                    iu Great Britain be 5 per cent, greater than in San Francisco, 100 ounces of
                    pure gold in the latter would not be worth 100 ounces of pure gold in London,
                    but 5 per cent, less; and the exchange would be at true par when bills for 105
                    ounces standard bullion, payable in San Francisco, sold in London for 100
                    ounces.” Since this has not been the practice in determining the par of
                    exchange—the 25 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 30 of Paris, and the old 109 of
                    New York, &lt;fcc., with London having been based more or less exactly on equal
                    weights of pure gold for pure gold—a question is suggested which the following
                    considerations may help to resolve.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n823/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0823-0788"/>
                <p>The 5 per cent, claimed from San Francisco is for a relative dearness of gold in
                    London, which can only be overcome by carrying the gold from the one place to
                    the other; but it would be illogical to charge in a bill of exchange for a
                    transport of specie which it is the express object and effect of the bill to
                    supersede. The merchant in London would be entitled to sell a bill on San
                    Francisco for a sum equal to 100 ounces of gold, and to include the costs of
                    exchange, if any; or his debtor in San Francisco might buy a bill on London for
                    a sum sterling equal to 100 ounces of gold; and if the course of exchange were
                    such that this bill cost him only 99 ounces, the merchant in London would yet
                    have no reason to complain. If neither of these modes of settlement were
                    available, the debtor in San Francisco would hive to send 100 ounces of gold to
                    London, in which case there would be no rate of exchange in question.</p>
                <p>But, apart from the less value of bullion in some countries than in others owing
                    to nearness to the mines or other causes, there is a cheapness of the metallic
                    money, as well as the general currency of a country, which operates directly on
                    the rate of exchange, and requires in oue form or other the recognition of a
                    different par from that established under other conditions. The standard may be
                    tampered with; the alloy may be increased; the weight of the coins may be
                    diminished and diminished, till, like the Turkish piastre, they become scarce a
                    shadow of themselves. It is obvious that innovations of this kind compel a
                    rectification of the estimated par of exchange. In other cases coins are
                    legitimately changed; and these variations, in so <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    far as they supersede or modify coins which entered into the par estimate, are
                    bound to have a new rating. A country which allows its coinage to be much worn,
                    defaced, and generally light in weight, is in the same position as one which has
                    deliberately lowered its standard of value; for though its light coins, when
                    sent abroad, which they are not apt to be, count for no more than they weigh,
                    there is the other and more serious effect that they may have been already well
                    weighed at home, and have so raised the prices of the goods of the country as to
                    place all dealings in them under a delusion as to their real value. One may well
                    believe, however, that this is a form of monetary evil which has now passed
                    away. There will always bè some more or less worn and light coin3 in a metallic
                    circulation, and as long as these are limited in number, and circulate in the
                    country of their coinage at the mint price, they do little or no harm. There is
                    a much more convenient process by which to cheapen the money of a country than
                    any form of debasing the coinage, namely, to dispense wholly or almost wholly
                    with metallic money in favour of an inconvertible paper currency.</p>
                <p>When a country is impelled to issue paper money not payable on demand in gold or
                    silver, its monetary value slips away from all fixed reckoning. The first
                    effects are so agreeable as naturally to lead to a larger and a still larger
                    issue, and the agreeable effects are prolonged until the real situation begins
                    to be disclosed, and, finally, derangement has spread so widely on all sides
                    that extrication becomes a task of the gravest difficulty. The effects even on
                    the foreign exchanges are for a time somewhat illusive. There being no more need
                    for gold and silver, nearly the whole stock of bullion passes out, and like a
                    new found capital gives ample power of purchase abroad. The importer, finding
                    that there are increasing prices for every commodity in the paper money, goes
                    into his business with new heart and will. The premium, which has early begun to
                    be established on foreign bills, soon becomes so large that the exporter
                    imagines that he can make a fair profit out of the premium on his foreign bill
                    alone, though there may not be a margin of a fraction of one per cent, of profit
                    in the actual trade. Supposing such a result possible to the exporter, it is
                    clear that he makes his profit entirely out of his neighbour the importer, who
                    has to buy his bill, and consequently to pay the premium. Both cannot be right
                    in their views, and in point of fact both are wrong until they begin to realize
                    that the inconvertible paper dollar, rouble, or florin is not so valuable and
                    has not the same purchasing power as the metallic money, or as the paper notes
                    maintained in a constant practical convertibility. This fact is demonstrated
                    within the country itself by the more or less gradual and uniform, but
                    inevitable, rise of prices of all commodities, and of bullion among others, in
                    this new currency. It is discovered very early in the foreign exchanges, not
                    only since there is likely to be an excess of imports over exports when a
                    country is in the act of denuding itself of specie, but because the foreigner
                    has to be careful to get the value of his goods or produce as it is known to him
                    in his own money; and any important change in the money of a country, therefore,
                    obtains a sharp valuation abroad. Both at home and abroad it is soon discovered
                    that the par of exchange, as formerly established, has passed away, and that a
                    new par has come into operation under the pure force of the natural relations of
                    the case. The importer finds no advantage from the advancing prices of what he
                    imports in the domestic markets, since he has to pay more of the domestic money
                    for the foreign bill of exchange by which he discharges the debt for his
                    imports; and the exporter finds no advantage in the premium on his foreign bill
                    which he sells to the importer, since it only replaces what he has already paid
                    in the increased cost of his commodities and other outlays.</p>
                <p>This action of exchange is now so familiar as to require little illustration; but
                    a commonplace example may be given, to render more obvious the result on both
                    sides. A, a merchant in London, at a period when the rate of exchange between
                    London and Hamburg is at exact par, can sell a hogshead of sugar worth £50 in
                    London to B in Hamburg for £100, or weight for weight in gold of 100 sovereigns.
                    He exports, draws his bill on B, which he sells for £100, and derives his profit
                    of £50 on the sugar, less expenses of transit, At another period of equal
                    scarcity and dearness of sugar in Hamburg as compared with London, but when the
                    currency of England has been under suspension of specie payment, and has been so
                    much increased in quantity that prices of sugar and other commodities have
                    doubled in the meanwhile, the hogshead of sugar now sells in London for £100. A,
                    however, again exports, draws on B for £100, and, the rate of exchange being now
                    100 per cent, in favour of Hamburg against the currency of England, sells the
                    bill for £200 in London, and makes a profit in the English currency of £100,
                    equal to £50 in undepreciated money—the same profit as he made before. The
                    results to B, all things being equal as supposed save the depreciation of the
                    English currency, are also the same in both transactions. The case of a British
                    importer, in corresponding circumstances, would not differ from that of A, the
                    exporter; because, however unfavourable the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi>
                    exchange might be in the bills by which he paid for his imports from abroad, he
                    would be repaid by the increased nominal prices obtained for them in the home
                    market.</p>
                <p>As long as a change in the par of the money of two countries is not recognized or
                    clearly understood, there may be much miscalculation and irregular profit and
                    loss among the merchants on both sides. On the other hand, as soon as noted and
                    brought under generally acknowledged estimate, it does not interfere, <hi
                    rend="italic">per se,</hi> with the movement of produce or the fair profits of
                    those engaged in foreign trade.</p>
                <p>But how is the depreciation of an inconvertible paper currency to be measured? As
                    a convertible paper currency <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0824-0789"/> only maintains its par with gold by being always
                    payable on demand in the gold it promisee to pay, so an inconvertible paper
                    currency falls just so much below the par of gold as the difference between the
                    amount of gold it professes to be and the amount of gold it exchanges for in its
                    own market. The price of bullion in an inconvertible paper currency rises like
                    that of other commodities—not, indeed, in its general market value, but in its
                    market price within the sphere of the currency; and the amount of this rise
                    marks what may be called either a discount on the paper money or a premium on
                    the gold, and this discount or premium becomes a measure of the depreciation of
                    the currency. It is by no means a satisfactory standard, for it may vary from
                    day to day, and in this respect be as unlike as possible to a par of exchange
                    between the gold and silver moneys alike of small and great states, which may
                    hold good without variation for any number of years, where may also be
                    restrictions on the sale of bullion, prohibition of the export of bullion, and
                    speculative combinations of paper-holders and gold-holders to “corner” each
                    other, and the fluctuations may be not only constant but sometimes extreme. But,
                    with all its disadvantages, the relation of gold to the paper money, as it
                    happens to be revealed in the markets, is the only measure of the depreciation
                    to be had, and the premium on gold has consequently to be reckoned as a
                    necessary component part of the rate of exchange with other countries.</p>
                <p>The history of the last twenty years, though years of abundant production of gold
                    and silver and great material prosperity, has been marked by an extended resort
                    to inconvertible paper money in many parts of the world; and the exchanges of
                    Russia, Austria, Italy, and many other countries might be referred to for ample
                    proofs of the effect of this monetary expedient on the nominal par, and the
                    extraordinary fluctuations to which it gives rise. The “greenback” money of the
                    United States, a result of the war between North and South, is probably the most
                    familiar, while in some respects also the most instructive example. The par of
                    the American dollar to the pound sterling was originally struck in the rough
                    proportion of $40 equal to .£9, which made the quotation at New York $4 44 to
                    the pound, or, as stated on the British side, 54d. to the dollar. But on strict
                    inquiry this did not correspond with the gold, weight for weight, in the dollar
                    and the sovereign, and was in fact 9 per cent, too favourable to the dollar. It
                    thus appeared that to correct the scales $9 had to be thrown in with every
                    hundred, and adhering to the old par with the tenacity which has been the
                    general commercial practice in such cases, the exchanges were held to be in
                    equilibrium when bills on London stood at $109 for every hundred of the
                    purchase-money, or 9 per cent, nominal premium in favour of England. The par, as
                    more definitely stated, was then in New York $4'85 equal to the pound, or in
                    London 49^d. equal to the dollar, and this remained the mean specie point from
                    which all other influences acting on the exchange caused the rate either to rise
                    or to fall, until the period of the civil war, and the issue of paper money,
                    guaranteed by Federal security, but inconvertible. The effect of the new
                    currency on the exchanges was neither immediate nor suddenly great in its
                    proportions. The wide territory and large population of the Northern States were
                    a powerful absorbent. Moreover, as the Government increased its issues the banks
                    withdrew their notes, which had the effect <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tanto</hi> of staying the progress of depreciation. But gold was
                    still absolutely necessary in the ports, and a premium on gold, inevitable from
                    the first, increased month by mouth with the increased issue and circulation of
                    “greenbacks.” What the nominal par of exchange now was became a sort of
                    arithmetical puzzle; for, taking the exchange of New York on London alone,
                    without respect to other countries trading with the United States (the money of
                    some of which was undergoing similar depreciation at the same period), the
                    established premium of 9 per cent, in favour of London was met and supplemented
                    by this new premium on gold, and to add the one premium to the other would not
                    be enough, because the dollar itself was now fallen away from its value when the
                    $9 to the hundred had been strictly ascertained and arranged as a corrective of
                    the original rough par of $40 equal to <hi rend="italic">£9.</hi> The
                    Government, issuing the new currency that produced this disturbance in the
                    foreign exchanges, had no theory on the subject, and only made some feeble
                    attempts to regulate the sale of bullion. The adjustment was left in the main to
                    the calculation of bankers and merchants on both sides, in presence of the
                    natural causes in operation, and the solution thus attained may be all the more
                    significant. The premium on gold in its exchange at New York with the paper
                    currency was added to the former premium of 9 per cent, in favour of London, and
                    the 9 per cent, itself, marked of old in $9 of bullion value, was increased <hi
                    rend="italic">pro rata</hi> by the same premium.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Goschen, in his book on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foreign Exchanges,</hi> gives the following definition of the process of
                    exchange between New York and London:—“If, before the issue of paper money, the
                    purchaser of a bill on England paid 100 dollars and 9 dollars for it, he would,
                    if the premium on gold had risen to 50 per cent., in the first place pay 150
                    dollars instead of the 100, and in the second 13⅜ dollars instead of 9 dollars,
                    or half as much again as what we may call the correcting premium. Thus, if the
                    price of bills when gold stood at 150 was 163⅜, this price would correspond to
                    the price of 109 at the time when there was no premium on gold. The price might
                    rise to 165, or fall to 161, according as there was supply or demand, but the
                    mean point would be ascertained by the process which has been
                    described.”</p></note> This rule, has since regulated the nominal par of
                    exchange between New York and London through wide ranges of fluctuation. The
                    exchange was often as high as 180 during the war, so that the quotation must
                    often have been—New York $8O = £1, London 30d. = $1O. It is no less worthy of
                    remark that, without the actual resumption of specie payment, the “greenback ’
                    dollar has been quoted of late in New York and other American cities at the
                    metallic par of 4’85—a rare though not unprecedented phenomenon, to be
                    attributed to a severe financial and commercial crisis, followed by four years
                    of lowered prices, steady excess of exports over imports, and accumulation of
                    bullion.</p>
                <p>The effect of issues of inconvertible paper money, or the suspension of cash
                    payment of paper currency already in circulation on the par of exchange, is the
                    same as that of a change of the standard of value, a debasement of the coinage,
                    or, where in one of two countries the money is gold, and in the other silver, a
                    depreciation of one metal as compared with the other. When two countries par
                    their gold coins, the object is to arrive at a common term by which value for
                    value will be paid, in equivalent weight and purity of metal, out of the money
                    of each other. When one of them displaces its gold coins by inconvertible paper
                    money, the same object has to be attained, and this is reached, though not so
                    fixedly as in the par of metallic coins, by the premium which gold commands over
                    the paper money in the sphere of its currency. The former par in such cases may
                    be adhered to as a landmark, and this gold premium may be treated as nominal
                    premium on one side and nominal discount on the other, but it is substantially
                    of the nature of par of exchange, and becomes a necessary integer of the rate of
                    exchange. In the case of countries of one of which gold, and of the other
                    silver, is the standard money, the nominal par is subject to variation from
                    changes in the relative market value of the two metals. If, for example, the
                    relation on which the par proceeded was 15 ounces of silver equal to 1 ounce of
                    gold, and the depreciation of silver becomes such that 17 ounces <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0825-0790"/> will buy only 1 ounce of gold, the par of
                    exchange between the two countries will follow the course of that
                    depreciation.</p>
                <p>The course of the exchanges of India has been much affected of late years by the
                    depreciation of silver, and so also those of all silver-paying countries. The
                    drawer of a bill sterling on London in Calcutta or Bombay is literally selling
                    gold for silver, and, whatever the more ordinary par may have been, is bound to
                    take into account the market value of silver. In 1876, owing to the large
                    quantity of demonetized German silver thrown upon the market, less directly to a
                    pre existing cause, namely, the large extent to which silver had been cast out
                    even of the fractional currency of countries largely committed to inconvertible
                    paper, and also to exaggerated reports of abundant increase of production in the
                    American mines, silver fell to 47d. an ounce—about the lowest point reached in
                    its relation to gold, and a great reduction from what had long been its par
                    value of 5s. 2d. an ounce. The consequence was that the Indian rate of exchange
                    declined to Is. 6∣d. per rupee in six months’ sight bills on London, or, in
                    other words, that the rupee, having an accustomed par value of near 2s., was
                    uorth only Is. 6^d. sterling, <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> say seven months’
                    interest accruing between the date and the maturity of the bill. It is
                    difficult, or rather impossible, as foreign bills are negotiated, to distinguish
                    the respective force of the various causes operating on the rate of exchange. In
                    the case of Indianearly all the constituents of exchange are adverse to the
                    value of the rupee, save that of rate of interest, which is higher in Calcutta
                    or Bombay than in London. The Indian drawer of a six months’ bill on London
                    would lose more by holding the bill till its maturity than the buyer of the bill
                    who remits it to London. for acceptance and discount; and some middle term must
                    be struck between them, according as the rates of interest in India and England
                    vary. But, on the other hand, India is a country where the imports always exceed
                    the exports, where foreign capital in many forms has been largely invested aud
                    has to render its annual tribute, and where the financial relations of the
                    Government of India and the Government of England are such that the latter has
                    to draw periodically a considerable amount of bills on the Indian treasuries; so
                    that, whatever the par of gold and silver might be, the supply of bills on
                    London would always be less than the demand, or, in other words, the Indian
                    creditors have some advantage over the Indian debtors of London in the rate of
                    exchange. Were gold the money of India, the range of the premium thus
                    established on the bill jn London would be limited by the cost of remitting
                    gold; but silver being the money of India, the action of the premium itself, or
                    rather of the relative indebtedness of which it is the result, is to extend the
                    range of thespecielimit by lessening the demand for silver abroad. The rupee
                    being le33 valuable than it formerly was, does less work in the Indian
                    circulation and is all the more needed at home; to export it in payment of the
                    adverse balance of trade would be to send it where it is less valuable still. It
                    may thus be concluded that the depreciation of silver has been much the most
                    potent and constant element in the adverse current of Indian exchange. The price
                    of silver having since 1S76 risen to 53Jd., the rate of six months’ bills in
                    London has risen to Is. 8∣d, The rate of Indian exchange rises in the export
                    seasons when the supply of foreign bills is increased; and it rises with the
                    price of silver at all seasons.</p>
                <p>Tn the silver exchange between Hamburg and London the same rule prevailed. In
                    Hamburg silver was money, but in England and other countries which have a gold
                    standard it is only merchandise, and a rise or fall in the price of silver
                    affected the value of a bill on Hamburg or a bill drawn on Hamburg in English
                    sovereigns. Where a double standard exists, as in France, bills between that
                    country and another are drawn in the standard which is common to both. Thus in
                    the direct exchange between Paris and London, the bills are usually or almost
                    wholly gold bills.</p>
                <p>2. Were there a common international money, the supply and demand of bills would
                    be the chief determining cause of a rise or fall in the rate of exchange. Hence,
                    in distinction from the nominal par, the relation of supply and demand of bills
                    has been called “real exchange.” Mr Goschen speaks of it as “the primary element
                    in the value of bills,” which, from so practical an authority, may be regarded
                    as indicating that, notwithstanding all the varieties of money, this continues
                    to hold the chief place in the negotiation of bills of exchange, or that, the
                    nominal par being once determined, or a common principle formed for its
                    rectification when the money of a country has depreciated, it ceases to require
                    the calculation which must always be given to the supply aud demand of bills in
                    the market. As the sum of the bills offered, and the sum ready to be bought,
                    never express the whole of the cleans upon, or the whole of the debts due to a
                    country, but only such claims as have been drawn for, and debts the time of
                    payment of which has come or is nearly approaching, there is always more or less
                    change of the relation of supply and demand, as well as opportunity of judgment
                    as to the probable course of the market, and means of applying correctives if
                    the balance be swaying too much on the one side or the other. If the price of
                    foreign bills be depressed for want of buyers, drawers may hold back a little;
                    on the other hand, if the demand has raised the price of bills, all who have
                    sums to draw for will be induced to take advantage of the market, and so
                    increase the supply. The buyers are moved in the same way, quickening or
                    delaying their purchase within the limits of their period of remittance,
                    according·to their judgment of the probable course of the exchange. But the
                    buyer cannot delay beyond the day when his remittance is due in the foreign
                    country, nor the drawer beyond the ultimate dite of drawing, or his own need of
                    realizing the value of his bill; so that, amidst this oscillation, it is always
                    the peremptory business to be done that determines the effect of supply and
                    demand on the rate of exchange. The debtors of a foreign country, finding the
                    supply of bills on that country less than the demand, will be ready to give an
                    addition of price for them, in proportion to the scarcity, within the cost or up
                    to the cost of remitting specie; and the creditors or drawers on a foreign
                    country will submit in the other extremity to discount on their bills within the
                    cost of sending them to their correspondent or banker’s correspondent abroad,
                    with orders to take payment and remit the proceeds in specie. When the course of
                    exchange, as thus pursued from week to week, reveals that the claims immediate
                    and maturing upon any country are greater than the debts due to it, and cannot
                    be discharged through the mechanism of direct aud indirect bills of exchange,
                    its balance of debt can oιdy be paid by remittances of bullion or an increased
                    export of goods and produce, or other exportable value.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to dwell further on the law of supply and demand of bills,
                    which differs little from that of other commodities, beyond remarking that an
                    inadequate idea would be formed of the efficacy of bills of exchange in
                    liquidating international debts without taking into account an immense banking
                    organization, aided by bill-brokers and dealers in foreign exchange, who have
                    all the main currents of indebtedness under their eyes, and know with the
                    precision of practice how the debts of one centre can be met by its claims upon
                    others, and a stupendous mass of conflicting operations, ordinary and
                    extraordinary, be most economically effected. Fifty or a hundred millions
                    sterling, as in the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0826-0791"/> case of the French indemnity to Germany, can be
                    transferred from Paris to Berlin at a time without material disturbance of the
                    more ordinary business of exchange. The British chancellor of the exchequer
                    could transfer three millions and a quarter from London to Washington in payment
                    of the Alabama indemnity before the operation was well known in the principal
                    marts of the two countries. When England is lending ten millions to India,
                    fifteen millions to the Australian colonies, or twenty millions to innumerable
                    enterprises in the United States and Canada, or so many millions to Russia,
                    Turkey, or the River Plate republics—or making several of such loans at nearly
                    about the same time, as has sometimes happened—the effect on the foreign
                    exchanges, though considerable, is seldom thought of. A foreigu loan is usually
                    taken out—a large part in goods, another part in bills, and the balance most
                    probably in specie. But the effect of a foreign loan on the exchanges is exactly
                    the same as if the borrowing country had exported produce to the lending country
                    equivalent to the amount of the loan, placing it in debt to that amount. The
                    lender has become bound by contract to pay so much to the borrower. The whole
                    weight of a foreign loan, therefore, falls at once to what may be called the
                    adverse exchange of the lending country or the favourable or less unfavourable
                    exchange of the borrowing country. The reverse action comes in half-yearly or
                    yearly rills, when the interest and redemptions of the loan, spread over a
                    series of years, are payable. A foreign loan, if prudently and honourably
                    conceived, may thus, as regards even the rate of exchange, be advantageous on
                    both sides. The lending country gives a great advantage at once to the borrowing
                    country in its exchange, which may be no evil in itself, and which the borrowing
                    country, if the terms of the loan be fulfilled, repays in a period of years,
                    during which its exporting and paying power may be reasonably expected to
                    increase, which may be a common good. It may be added that foreign loans and
                    investments of capital in foreign countries, badly as many may have been
                    conducted, yet in their product of sound and marketable stocks and shares come
                    to play a generally useful part in the rates of exchauge. The value of
                    commercial bills might not be so equable between such centres as London and
                    Paris, or London and New York, without the intervention of stockexchange
                    securities.</p>
                <p>3. It is obvious that the number of days or months a bill has to run before
                    payable imports the question of interest as an element of valuation in the rate
                    of exchange. The usance of foreign bills is extremely various, from short to
                    long, from payable at sight to payable at six months after sight; and days of
                    grace are allowed by the law or custom of some few countries considerable enough
                    to be taken into count. Where a bill is payable so many days or months after
                    sight the time that must elapse, in the ordinary course of communication, before
                    it can be presented for acceptance, is a further prolongation of the currency of
                    the bill. The buyer takes it with this weight of time upon it, and, whatever the
                    period may be, is entitled to a concession equivalent to the interest of the
                    money which he pays, the converse happening in the case of stocks and shares on
                    which dividend or interest has accrued at the period of sale, and must be
                    accounted for to the seller in the price. But the important question in foreign
                    bills of exchange is what rate of interest is to rule in the transaction Is it
                    that of the country where the bill is drawn, or the country where it is payable,
                    or a compromise between the two? The drawer, in offering to transfer his bill to
                    a buyer, is wholly in the domain of the rate of interest in his own market. If
                    he sells, he gets the value of the bill in money worth so much interest; and if
                    he holds the bill till its maturity, or to some period nearer its maturity, he
                    deprives himself of money for that period worth the same interest. The buyer
                    who, in the event of an exchange, pays down the value of the bill in money would
                    seem to be under the same condition; but in reality, when closely examined, the
                    relations of the buyer and the seller of a bill of exchange to the rate of
                    interest are different. The buyer has a debt to pay in the country on which the
                    bill is drawn, which debt he is bound to pay <hi rend="italic">noiv;</hi> and
                    for his purpose the bill is all the more valuable the less weight of interest it
                    bears, or, in other words, the less discount it is subject to. Supposing,
                    therefore, the bill is drawn in a country where the rate of interest is 7 per
                    cent, on a country where the rate of interest is 3⅜ per cent., possession of the
                    bill will be more profitable, as regards rate of interest, to the buyer than to
                    the seller. If the seller holds the bill, it bears 100 per cent, more weight of
                    interest than it would bear in the hands of the buyer. If the rates of interest
                    in the two countries be exactly reversed, the bill bears 100 per cent. more of
                    this weight in the hands of the buyer than of the seller. Thus, after the par of
                    the currencies has been established, which, as we have seen, is always
                    practically established, even in the case of an inconvertible paper currency, by
                    the bullion test, and must be regarded as the first condition of all foreign
                    exchange, this question of interest is sufficiently important to modify the
                    action of supply and demand, and of other circumstances operating either to
                    raise the rate of exchange above or depress it below the par of the currencies.
                    It is one of those innumerable commercial relations in which there is an
                    advantage to buyer or seller, but which cannot be realized without mutuality,
                    and which consequently helps them to a transaction. If the advantage of rate of
                    interest be in favour of the buyer of a bill of ex’ change he will be inclined,
                    other elements of valuation con sidered, to give a somewhat larger price for it
                    than if this were not in the account; and if the advantage be in favour of the
                    seller he will be less exacting. The whole advantage on either side may not be
                    realized in the actual terms in either case; but it will have had some effect
                    towards a mediation of the prices.</p>
                <p>The price of a bill, apart from other elements, is the sum of the bill <hi
                    rend="italic">minus</hi> the interest it bears at the rate of discount in the
                    country where it Î3 payable. Yet in the practical negotiation this does not hold
                    exact, because the value of the bill to the seller or the buyer is always
                    modified by the relation of the rate of interest where it is payable to the rate
                    of interest where it is drawn.</p>
                <p>Rate of interest, though in the aspect it presents to the seller and buyer of a
                    bill thus plain enough, yet comes to play so great a part in the general course
                    of exchange that it is worth while to pursue the subject a little further. Rate
                    of interest regulates the supply and demand of bills, and affects the rate of
                    exchange through that element; where the balance of indebtedness is against a
                    country an advance of the rate of interest tends to restrain imports and to
                    stimulate exports, by which effects the balance of debt is reduced; and where
                    the action of trade is not sufficient to overcome the evil, further rises of the
                    rate of interest may be employed to attract imports of foreign capital and
                    specie. In the case we have supposed of two countries, where the rate of
                    interest is 100 per cent, more in the one than the other, this relation of their
                    rates of interest may be the normal relation from the greater abundance or the
                    greater profits of capital in the one than the other, and their exchange may be
                    supposed to be in equilibrium, so that this normal relation is not disturbed by
                    any changes of rate of interest to correct the supply and demand of bills, or
                    the balance of trade. The effect, as we have seen, of difference of interest was
                    in favour of the price of the bill drawn by the country of high interest on the
                    country of low interest, from the fact that the buyer was moving the bill <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"

                    cent, to one where it bore a weight of only 3⅜ per cent, interest. But suppose
                    the balance of indebtedness has become so adverse to the country of low interest
                    that the rate has been increased to 7 per cent, in order to improve the course
                    of exchange, and that the effect has been, as must more or less follow, to
                    render the foreign drawer less eager to sell, and the foreign remitter more
                    eager to buy. The remitter oι buyer will find the new influence thus introduced
                    operating in the same direction—viz., in favour of the price of the bill; but,
                    on the other hand, the difference of interest has disappeared. Two effects have
                    thus proceeded from the same cause, which neutralize each other so far as they
                    go; and the remitter, instead of buying a bill, may as well, as regards the rate
                    of interest in the two countries, be drawn upon by his foreign creditor. If the
                    rate of interest be further increased to 10 per cent., the drawer may be induced
                    to hold the bill in order to save the 3 per cent, of discount above the rate of
                    interest in his own market, or an investing buyer may intervene, and give such a
                    price for the bill as will allow the seller 1∣ or 1 per cent, of the profit, and
                    leave 1^ or 2 per cent, to himself. In either case the bill wouΓd be held till
                    it matured, and relief to that extent be afforded to the exchange of the country
                    raising its rate of interest. But it is clear that not until the rate were
                    raised 3, 4, or 5 per cent, above the rates of the countries drawing upon it
                    could any effect of this kind be produced. It thus appears that the function of
                    rate of interest in controlling the. supply and demand of bills is a strictly
                    limited function; and this limitation will probably be found in all the effects
                    expected from it on the state of exchange. It may hasten the course of payments
                    due to a country, but it does not lessen the adverse balance of indebtedness,
                    nor can it much retard the pressure of the foreign claims. It may restrain
                    importation of foreign goods, but it may not at the same time increase
                    exportation of domestic goods; or, if increasing export, it may not diminish
                    import. These are results which will depend on many other causes. It may tend to
                    lower prices, and thus seem to check import, while facilitatingexport; but,
                    forming in itself an addition to the cost of production and exchange, it may
                    render much outward as well as inward trade less possible. If the rate of
                    interest be carried high enough it may attract much capital from neighbouring
                    countries. Foreign bankers and lenders will buy up bills on the country as the
                    best mode of importing their capital,, or may import specie; and admirable as
                    this service may often be, yet it does not lessen the foreign indebtedness of
                    the country. It only transmutes one form of the adverse balance into another
                    more convenient for the time being; and in the meanwhile, if the high rate of
                    interest has crippled the productive and exporting resources of the country,
                    little good or a reverse balance of evil may have been done. Hence bullion
                    reserves are either inadequate in the plan of their formation, or they miss
                    their use and efficacy if, when a heavy balance of indebtedness appears in the
                    exchanges, they cannot be trenched upon without large and excited advances of
                    the rate of interest.</p>
                <p>4. Nothing is more definite in the system of exchange than what has been more
                    than once stated in the course of these remarks, namely, that the cost of
                    remitting specie forms the limit of variation in the rates of bills. That the
                    buyer of a foreign bill will not give more for it than the cost of remitting
                    specie equal in amount to his foreign debt is an axiom which holds good under
                    all the ordinary conditions. But there are exceptions to the rule where the
                    conditions vary from the ordinary. From the countries of productive gold and
                    silver mines bullion flows abroad as naturally as the corn, cotton, wine, or oil
                    which forms the special merchandise of a country, and it will so flow
                    irrespective of supply and demand of bills, rate of interest, and other causes
                    which have so much sway in rates of exchange. San Francisco will export gold and
                    silver to London in al’ states of supply and demand of bills, and when its rate
                    of interest may be double that of the Bank of England, and in the common
                    parlance money is there dearer than in London, though it may be only that the
                    average profits of capital are larger in the one place than in the other. If
                    bullion is needed at New York, and commanding a higher premium on the Federal
                    currency, it will be matter of calculation to the bullion exporter at San
                    Francisco whether to send a consignment to New York or to London. If, since the
                    discovery of the Californian mines, a metallic currency had been established
                    throughout the Federal Union, the United States would no doubt have absorbed a
                    proportion of the gold and silver shipped to Europe; but this object
                    accomplished, the export to Europe would have proceeded much as it has been
                    proceeding. In short, from gold and silver producing countries the export of
                    bullion is not a remittance of money, but a transmission of the exportable
                    produce of labour, which but for export would not have been produced. Then,
                    there is the case of exchange between countries of silver standard and countries
                    of gold standard, from either of which remittances of specie cannot be made
                    without exact reference to the market value of the two metals. This will have
                    been already marked in the par of exchange between the gold and the silver
                    country, but it will have introduced a new element into the cost of remittance,
                    since the specie remitted will have to be sold into the specie standard of the
                    country to which it is remitted. Silver from India and China, for example, in
                    the circumstances of recent years, cannot be remitted in payment of an adverse
                    balance of exchange without taking into account a subsequent act of
                    merchandise—namely, what the silver will bring in the gold of England; and this,
                    with silver under a course of depreciation, may be so doubtful that the buyer of
                    a bill on London will rather yield in the rate of exchange, and give some
                    fraction more of a rupee for the pound sterling than run the risk of it. Neither
                    in payment of an adverse balance of debt, nor in transferring capital from one
                    country to another with the view of taking advantage of a higher rate of
                    interest, can specie be remitted between gold and silver standard countries free
                    from this contingency. A Hamburg capitalist wishes to profit by a rate of
                    interest two or three per cent, higher in England than at home. He will
                    therefore buy bills on London up to a certain limit of price; if he has any
                    gold, he will then remit gold rather than exceed this limit for bills; or he
                    will remit the silver specie of Hamburg subject to its market value in London.
                    In this case, indeed, the foreign capitalist has more than one act of
                    merchandise to contemplate, for he has to look to the reverse action when the
                    rate of interest may be higher at home than in England, and when it will be his
                    motive to re convert his English sovereigns into silver, which in the relative
                    condition of the market value of the two metals may be either favourable or
                    unfavourable. If unfavourable, he will buy bills of England on Hamburg, or some
                    other centre with which the exchange is favourable to Hamburg, rather than
                    re-transmit silver at a higher cost than the rate of the bills. It is obvious
                    that all this does not alter the principle that the cost of specie remittance is
                    the limit of rate of exchange on bills, but only that it gives a larger range to
                    the variation of rate, and to the specie limit, between two countries whose
                    money and standard of value are of different metals than would exist between two
                    countries where they were of the same metal.</p>
                <p>In exchange between a gold-paying and a silver-paying country, one of which, say
                    the silver country, has gone largely into an inconvertible paper currency, the
                    case becomes more complicated, and the specie limit to adverse <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0828-0793"/> rate on bills recedes, till, if the
                    inconvertibility be so great as to be incapable of valuation, or the Government
                    in its ignorance or alarm has prohibited the export of specie, the limit is
                    wholly lost. A Russian merchant, who has ample silver and paper roubles at
                    command for his purposes, but has a debt to discharge in America, or needs to
                    lift a cargo of cotton at Liverpool or of sugar at Glasgow, and finds that the
                    remittance even of such specie as he may be able to produce is illegal, must buy
                    a foreign bill or a banker’s draft on London at any price. At this stage the
                    rate of exchange passes out of the domain of principle, or natural action of
                    principle, into that of purely arbitrary considerations. When, from much less
                    sufficient causes, general discredit passes upon a country, the rate at which
                    its bills or acceptances may be valued is scarcely more reducible to rule. It
                    might even be difficult to define why in the same general circumstances there
                    should be collaterally a higher and lower course of exchange, and the bills
                    drawn or payable by one firm should differ in their rate from those drawn or
                    payable by another firm. It is only by removing abnormal conditions that one
                    arrives at the underlying principle which governs exchange, and determines the
                    success with which it is conducted.</p>
                <p>Accordingly it is in countries where bullion, separated from its necessary export
                    from the mines, has become money, and forms the common standard of value in
                    their international trade, that the limitation of the rate of exchange by the
                    cost of specie remittance is most clearly visible. Between all nations trading
                    on a gold basis there is a well-known and definite point above and below the par
                    of exchange where it becomes profitable to move gold from one to the other, and
                    which marks the extreme range of variation in the price of bills. Thus in the
                    exchange of London with Paris, New York, and Berlin respectively, 25Ί0, 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 81, and 20 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 30 mark a
                    point in the price of bills below par when it pays to send gold from London to
                    these centres; and, on the other hand, 25 ’ 30, 4 <hi rend="superscript"> φ</hi>
                    87, 20'50, a point above par when it becomes profitable to move gold from Paris,
                    New York, or Berlin to London.</p>
                <p>When the rate of exchange, touching, under the supply and demand of bills and
                    other elements of valuation, these extreme points on one side or the other, and
                    tending to exceed them, is the result of an actual over-indebtedness, a
                    transmission of bullion is the best and most satisfactory mode of settlement. It
                    directly reduces the balance of debt, and renders the price of bills again more
                    equitable to the traders. All other modes of fencing it off, save an increased
                    export of goods and produce, are more or less illusory. If, in such a juncture,
                    an amount of foreign capital has been invested in bills on the country with the
                    view of holding them to maturity for sake of profit in rate of interest, and now
                    with the view of realizing the value of the bills in gold they should be pressed
                    on the market before maturity for discount, an advance of one per cent, in the
                    rate of discount may be sufficient to induce the foreign capitalists to hold the
                    bills till they mature. And another advance of one per cent, in the rate of
                    discount may induce them to reinvest in other bills on the country. But the root
                    of the adverse exchange will not have been removed. It will always appear when
                    the foreign capital thus invested in bills on the country is from any cause
                    withdrawn, and until the over-indebtedness is liquidated by remittances of
                    specie, increased export of produce, or transfers of saleable shares and
                    securities.</p>
                <p>If, on the other hand, the rate of exchange has been brought to the specie limit
                    by bills, representing no actual debt, but drawn and accepted solely for the
                    purpose of moving bullion, as may probably happen, there is no remedy for what
                    may prove an inordinate demand for specie by irregular means but the detection
                    of the bills, and either refusing them discount or discounting them under
                    exceptionally high rates of interest.</p>
                <p>5. An exposition, however brief, of the causes operating on the rate of exchange
                    would scarce be complete without including the effect of opinion or estimate,
                    correct or erroneous, of the probable course of the market; and therefore it may
                    be observed that a judgment has to be formed in every new phase of the numerous
                    fluctuations. The seller of bills finds that within a few days the market has
                    taken an unfavourable turn. If he judges that this has'arisen from merely
                    accidental or temporary causes he will be inclined to hold his bills for what he
                    deems their true value; or if, on the contrary, he judges that the causes
                    operating are more deeply seated, and likely to become stronger for a time, he
                    will sell with the least possible delay. Should his judgment be justified by the
                    event he will have done what is right for him, if otherwise he will have done
                    what is wrong; but in either case, his abstention or action will have affected
                    the supply and demand of bills in the meanwhile. In all the great marts of
                    exchange, and in London probably more than in others, there are frequent
                    wavecurrents so to speak, which cannot be rightly interpreted either as the sign
                    of a protracted state of exchange between the points of the compass in which
                    they flow, or of the general foreign indebtedness of the centre upon which they
                    are directed. When New York balances its debts to China and In&lt;tia by bills
                    on London, the bills affect the course of Eastern exchange; but they lose much
                    of the significance they might otherwise bear when it is considered that New
                    York is in course of compensating London in other directions. These operations
                    come to be understood and systematized by dealers and agents in bills with much
                    accuracy; but in addition to the judgment that may be formed by a thorough
                    analysis of the substance of the various currents of exchange, there is the
                    effect of opinion on external events, which, though of almost daily occurrence
                    in one quarter or another, are wholly of future account, and which impress, not
                    only the connoisseurs of exchange, but the whole body of drawers and remitters,
                    from whom the original impulse on the action of exchange in all cases comes. The
                    examples that might be adduced of the great effect of passing events on exchange
                    are innumerable. In the beginning of 1861, when the disastrous rupture between
                    North and South had occurred, and war was imminent, the United States had a most
                    favourable balance of trade with England and Europe. Their exports of wheat and
                    flour and cotton in the previous year had at once reached a maximum in quantity
                    and a rise in value. The drawer of a bill on London was in so good a position
                    that he had only to wait for the buyer to get the value of his bill up to the
                    specie point. But’so eager were the drawers, in view of the pending outbreak of
                    civil war, to realize what was owing to them abroad, that they threw their bills
                    on the market in an abundance which reduced their price to the other end of the
                    scale. This, of course, had its converse effect at London, and bills on New York
                    were there selling at such a premium that it seemed as if the United States
                    would have to remit bidlion to Europe. The volume of bills, however, told its
                    own tale after a while. England had to remit bullion in large quantity to the
                    United States, and then people began to awake to the perception that, in the
                    exchange transactions, the one element most important of all had been left
                    out—namely, the relative indebtedness. It must have been a time of much profit
                    to those on both sides of the Atlantic who knew the actual state of affairs, and
                    of much loss to those who did not know, of whom there can be little doubt that
                    the latter were much the greater number, but the balance of value between the
                    two countries, as expressed on the face of the bills, had to be rendered all the
                    same.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0829-0794"/>
                <p>To take a more recent case. The exchange value of the Russian rouble during the
                    last twelve months of war between Russia and Turkey will amply illustrate what
                    is meant by the prevailing judgment on events in their future aspect, which,
                    while proceeding on a certain amount of reason, yet borders on panic, and may be
                    of the nature of panic. The issue of paper roubles had gone the length of 730
                    millions before the war, and there was a constantly increased remission during
                    the year, counteracted in some measure by conversions into loans bearing
                    interest. On the mobilization of the troops the value of the rouble was 29d. to
                    30d.; on war being declared it fell to 27d.; when it seemed as if Plevna could
                    not be taken it sank to 22 Ad.; when Plevna fell it rose to 26∣d.; and when it
                    followed that the conquest of Turkey and an armistice did not end the
                    difficulties, it fell to the lowest point it had touched, 22∣d.</p>
                <p>The term “favourable exchange,” as commonly used, not only means a state of the
                    exchanges when the debts due to a country abroad are so much greater than what
                    it owes abroad as to affect potentially the demand and supply of bills, and when
                    the money of the country so situated, as expressed in the price of bills, is
                    equal to more of the money of a foreign country than the nominal par—-when its·
                    bills on abroad, in short, arc dull of sale, while the foreign bills on itself
                    are in much demand; it is also applied to all stages, moderate or extreme, of
                    this relation of the foreign exchanges. And so the term “unfavourable,” of
                    course, applies to the opposite conditions. If these phrases had ever any
                    reference to the prosperity of the foreign trade of a country, they must have
                    arisen under the sway of “the mercantile system” of the last century, the
                    principle of which was that a balance payable in specie is the cardinal
                    condition of prosperous trade with any foreign country; or, if introduced under
                    that erroneous theory, they have been prolonged by the usage of bankers and
                    other dealers in foreign exchange, who, hiving large liabilities entailing
                    bullion payment, naturally consider a state of exchange which is on the eve of
                    bringing specie more favourable than one on the eve of taking it away. This is
                    quite true in the monetary view of the question, and it is true also as to the
                    relative indebtedness for the time being. But it is not true to extremes even in
                    a monetary sense. The condition of a country to which specie was always flowing
                    in and never going out would be a realization of the fate of Midas The most
                    favourable exchange, therefore, is that where there are only moderate
                    oscillations up or down from the par of exchange.</p>
                <p>While the terms “favourable” and “unfavourable” are thu3 somewhat misleading as
                    regards substantial interests, they are involved in a minor technical
                    complexity, which, though well understood by those in the business, may here be
                    stated. The tern13 would be strictly applicable in the sense they are used, were
                    the rate of exchange always quotel in the home money. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >certain</hi> properly in ex change transactions is the number of pounds,
                    dollars, francs, or florins a remitter has to pay abroad; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >uncertain</hi> is whit amount of his own money is equal to this amount of the
                    foreign money. Were the quotation on both sides respectively always made in the
                    home money, the fall or rise of the quotation would always be identifiable with
                    such terms as “favourable” or “unfavourable.” Both drawers and remitters would
                    be so familiar with their significance as to know what they meant. But this is
                    not the practice, and, with so much variety of currency, could hardly have been
                    the developed practice of exchange. The pound sterling of England is the largest
                    monetary unit, and there is always facility of expressing minute shades of
                    difference in the smaller units, more especially when, as in the case of Paris
                    or New York, they have a decimal character. In London, consequently, the public
                    only hear quotations of rate cf exchange with such countries as France and the
                    United States in the foreign money—London thus giving what is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">certain,</hi> and the smaller moneys the <hi rend="italic"
                    >variable.</hi> On the other hand, not only in the Australian and other British
                    colonies, where the standard of value is the same as in the parent country, but
                    in such large commercial regions as China and India the quotation of rate of
                    exchange on both sides is always expressed in sterling. The Chinese tael of
                    silver is worth so many English pence sterling at Canton; and the rupee is worth
                    so many English pence at Bombay or Calcutta; and in the same terms run the
                    quotations in London. The practice may not alter in any iota the true rate of
                    exchange, but it has the result that when the rate is quoted in sterling money,
                    as in the Indian, Chinese, and Australian exchanges, every drop in the quotation
                    is “more favourable” to England, every rise “less favourable,” and this will
                    hold good whether the quotations are made in England or in India, China, or
                    Australia; whereas, on the other hand, when exchanges are quoted in foreign
                    money—French, German, or American, &amp;c.—every drop in the rate by the same
                    rule is “less favourable,” every rise in the rate “more favourable” to England,
                    whether the quotation be made in Englaud or in the foreign countries.</p>
                <p>The states of exchange to which the terms “favourable” and “unfavourable” are
                    thus applied refer wholly to the effect of the demand and supply of bills; so
                    that, since the fluctuations of exchange are due to various causes, it would be
                    an improvement were the quotation always to include the par of exchange, whether
                    between the gold money of one country and the silver money of another, or
                    between either and inconvertible paper, the depreciation of which has to be
                    determined by the gold or silver premium in the country of its currency. The
                    actual rate above or below par would show the effect due to the supply and
                    demand of bills. When a sudden alteration takes place in foreign exchange,
                    nothing is more difficult than to discover the relative force of the cause or
                    causes to which it is to be ascribed, and yet nothing is more necessary to know
                    than this, whether in the correctives that may be applied or in the lessons to
                    be conveyed to importers and exporters.</p>
                <p>The limited meaning to be given to such terms as “favourable” and “unfavourable”
                    exchange probably applies to other statements that may arise legitimate! in
                    connexion with this subject. The principle, for instance, that the profit and
                    loss of exchange transactions fall, not between the two countries concerned, but
                    between the foreign creditors and debtors in one or other, is exact within its
                    own range; but it leaves as an open question whether in a country where from a
                    depreciated and depreciating currency the rate of foreign exchange is always
                    rising, the general result may not be adverse to its interests in export and
                    import trade. In like manner it would be more than questionable, because “the
                    mercantile theory” was wrong in supposing that a balance of foreign trade in
                    specie, or an excess of export value over import value, was the necessary
                    condition of national prosperity, to posit the opposite doctrine that an excess
                    of imports over exports is the only prosperous condition. The solution of this
                    question must depend on what may be called the permanent indebtedness of some
                    countries to others. A country which is under large tribute to foreign capital
                    is assuredly in the right way for itself and for other countries when the value
                    of its exported exceeds that of its imported produce. And so also it may be
                    observed that “rate of interest,” if we are correct in our reasoning on that
                    head, may not have the absolute control over the exchanges which was so strongly
                    emphasized for some years after the passing of the Bank Charter Act of 1844, and
                    has since only been modified in practice without any express recognition of the
                    principles involved.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Negotiation of Bills of Exchange.</hi></p>
                <p>Rates of exchange have undergone much variation of late years from changes of
                    standard—in some cases from gold to silver, and in others from silver
                    to'gold—and from the circulation of forced paper currency. The tendency,
                    however, is to greater uniformity. The gold standard of value adopted at Berlin
                    extends to the whole German empire, and the rates of exchange are now calculated
                    in imperial marks and ρfennige at Hamburg, Frankfort-on-the-Maine, Altona, and
                    other German places, where different moneys formerly were used. The money under
                    the new system is 100 pfennige = 1 mark, 20 marks = 1 twenty-mark gold piece
                    (imperial mark) =19s. 6 ’ 954 sterling mint par. The mark, which is the unit or
                    integer of the system, is a silver coin based on the ratio of 1 to 15⅜ as the
                    relative value of silver and gold. In like manner the kingdom of Italy has
                    extended a uniform exchange; and the rates at Naples, Palermo, Messina, Milan,
                    Turin, Florence, Leghorn, and other Italian towns are similar to the rates at
                    Genoa.</p>
                <p>Bills of exchange may be made payable on demand (as the invariable rule is in the
                    case of cheques), at sight, at a certain specified time <hi rend="italic">after
                    sight</hi> or <hi rend="italic">after date,</hi> or at <hi rend="italic"
                    >usance,</hi> which means the customary or usual time for which bills are drawn
                    from a given place, and when the time is doubled it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >doτMe usance.</hi> No bills are now drawn in London at <hi rend="italic"
                    >usance,</hi> and the practice is being gradually dropped in other countries.
                    The usance of bills drawn from France, Holland, and Germany is 30 days’ date;
                    from Spain and Portugal 60 days’; and from Italy 3 months’ date; but the
                    currency of bills is regulated more by the classes of business to which they
                    relate than to the usage of any country. The allowance of <hi rend="italic">days
                    of grace</hi> is also going out of fashion. <hi rend="italic">Three days</hi>
                    are still given on bills drawn upon or payable in the United Kingdom otherwise
                    than at sight, and a similar practice holds in the United States. St Petersburg
                    gives 3 days on sight bills and 10 days on date bills, Copenhagen 8 days,
                    Christiania 8 days; but in these and other cases the allowance may not mark so
                    distinctly the day when a bill is legally due as an interval within which
                    certain legal proceedings of the respective countries cannot be irstituted. The
                    practice, which was at one period extremely various, has now been reduced within
                    such narrow limits that in exchange transactions in London no account is taken
                    of days of grace.</p>
                <p>Bills of exchange in London are bought and sold through brokers, who go round the
                    mercantile and banking houses, and discover whether they are buyers or sellers
                    of bills. The negotiaticns are determined on Tuesdays and Fridays, which
                    correspond with the principal post days in foreign exchange business. In London,
                    as in other great commercial cities, bankers deal largely on the rise and fall
                    of exchanges,—buying bills when they expect a rise, and selling bills when they
                    expect a fall.</p>
                <p>Foreign bills are generally drawn in duplicate or triplicate, lest the first
                    should miscarry. When thus drawn in sets, the first is payable only “second and
                    third unpaid,” the second “first and third unpaid,” and the third “first and
                    second unpaid.” Where there is a doubt as to the acceptance, the first may be
                    sent unindorsed to a correspondent of the drawer in the place of payment to have
                    it accepted, and the second sold and put in circιιLιtion, bearing the name and
                    address of the party holding the first or accepted bill “in case of need,” that
                    is, in case he may not have obtained acceptance, and will protect the drawer
                    from having the bill returned through the indorsers. The indorsed second, and
                    the accepted first of exchange, when watered together, become one bill and are
                    valid.</p>
                <p>Exchange, as regards the abundant arithmetic to which it gives rise in its
                    negotiation, may be divided into—(1) Direct, or exchange between two countries
                    wholly based on their rates of exchange, which is so simple as to need no
                    remark; (2) Cross, or exchange between two countries in which a third country
                    has an interest, as when London, say, lias 10,000 francs in Γaris which he
                    wishes to move to Hamburg, and has to take account of his own course of exchange
                    to Hamburg as well as the direct between Paris and Hamburg, which is only less
                    simple than direct exchange, inasmuch as it requires two formulae instead of
                    one; and (3) Indirect or arbitrated, where exchange between two countries is
                    conducted through the medium of a third, or more than one other country, and
                    thus becomes more compound as the sphere of the operation is extended. It is an
                    arbitrated rate because ithas.no actual form, and is found only in figures out
                    of the current rates of exchange between more than two countries. The object
                    being to discover how a debt in one place may be most economically paid from
                    another, the question carries along with it not only the difference between
                    remitting and drawing whichexists in the simplest direct exchange— the debtor in
                    the one country and the creditor in the other having always the option of the
                    one remitting or the other drawing—but such <hi rend="italic">minuticc</hi> as
                    whether the rate of exchange given be in the foreign money or in sterling, till
                    it results in the following rules :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“For Remittances:—</hi></p>
                <p>“with a foreign rate, any arbitrated rate ia better than the direct rate if it is

                <p>“with a sterling rate, any arbitrated rate is better than the direct rate, if it

                    sterling, lend force to the observation above that theone rate should never be
                    lost in the other one-sidedly. If distinguished in the practical quotation of
                    exchanges, there seems no reason to take other than one in arbitrated
                    exchange.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi></p>
                <p>Nor is this all. Arbitrated rates are calculated for present money; the actual
                    rates of exchange on which they are calculated have been affected by time and
                    rate of interest. In the rate of direct exchange particularly, with which the
                    arbitrated rate has to be compared, this effect has to be estimated, long bills
                    reduced to short and the difference of interest on them discounted from the
                    basis of calculation <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie.</hi>
                    This, in a superficial view, may be counterpoised by drawing speculative bills
                    of longdate on a foreign centre, but there are limits to drawing on a place for
                    purposes external to its ordinary course of exchange, and a large amount of
                    bills thus directed without corresponding remittances might produce an effect on
                    the exchanges which would go far to upset the calculation.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that arbitration of exchange, thus burdened at every additional
                    length of the chain by difficulties of estimate, cannot be much extended or
                    become too artificial without the risk of miscarriage. But the mediation of
                    direct exchange through a third place is of such common and useful practice that
                    it may be desirable to give an example broad enough to illustrate the general
                    method of equation.</p>
                <p>Take London on Γaris at 3 months, quoted f.25'55; Paris on London at 3 months,
                    quoted f.25’10.</p>
                <p>The discount for 3 months, in the example to be given, is taken at 1 per cent.,
                    or 25 cents., which is deducted from the London rate and added to the Paris
                    rate, to make the two short or cash rates; thus reducing the former to f. 25’30,
                    and raising the latter to f.25’35.</p>
                <p>If this, variable price were in sterling, as for instance with Madrid, the
                    allowance for interest would have to be reversed, that is, added to the London
                    price, and subtracted from the price abroad.</p>

                    because by the former operation there will be made 5 cents, per pound, or about
                    one-fifth per cent, more than by the latter.</p>

                    remittances to Paris it appears from the arbitrated results that bills on
                    Frankfort, bought in London at 121 florins per £10 sterling, and sold in Paris
                    at 212 francs per 100 florins, will produce 12 cents, more than direct
                    remittances from London to Paris, or 7 cents, more than is yielded by direct
                    drafts of Paris upon London.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2d—</hi> For returns from Paris, it appears from the arbitrated
                    results that bills on Leghorn, bought in Paris at 85 centimes per paper lira
                    Italiana, and sold in London at paper lira Italiana 29*47⅜ per pound sterling,
                    will cost 29 cents, less titan direct bills from Paris, and will give 24 cents,
                    more than drafts from London on Paris.</p>
                <p>Such is the manner in which the various exchanges are calculated in order to
                    ascertain which will answer best for a speculation in bills through intermediate
                    places. The contingency of a change of rates has to be considered, and the
                    charges of brokerage and commission on the operation have to be deducted from
                    the result, or may be reduced when the operation is done by branches of the same
                    house, or on joint account.</p>
                <p>The elasticity of arbitrated rates of exchange is put to the severest strain when
                    a large subsidy, or monster indemnity, like that of France to Germany, has to be
                    paid by one country to another. In these cases it is necessary to employ
                    extensive banking co-operation, and at centres on which the drafts are heavy to
                    arrange means for the support of the exchange.</p>
