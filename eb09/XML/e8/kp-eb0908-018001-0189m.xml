                <p><label type="entry">EMPHYSEMA</label> (from ψφw&lt;iω, to inflate), in medicine,
                    means an abnormal presence of air in certain parts of the body. In its
                    restricted sense, however, it is generally employed to designate a peculiar
                    affection of the lungs, of which there are two forms. In one of these there is
                    overdistension of the air-cells of these organs (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anatomy),</hi> and in parts destruction of their walls, giving rise to the
                    formation of large sacs, from the rupture and running together of a number of
                    contiguous air-vesicles. This is termed vesicular emphysema. In the other form
                    the air is infiltrated into the connective tissue beneath the pleura and between
                    the pulmonary air-cells, constituting what is known as interlobular
                    emphysema.</p>
                <p>The former variety is by far the more common, and appears to be capable of being
                    produced by various causes, the chief of which are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. Where a portion of the lung has become wasted, or its vesicular structure
                    permanently obliterated by disease, without corresponding falling in of the
                    chest wall, the neighbouring air vesicles or some of them undergo dilatation to
                    fill the vacuum.</p>
                <p>2. In some cases of bronchitis, where numbers of the smaller bronchial tubes
                    become obstructed, the air in the pulmonary vesicles remains imprisoned, the
                    force of expiration being insufficient to expel it; while, on the other hand,
                    the stronger force of inspiration being adequate to overcome the resistance, the
                    air-cells tend to become more and more distended, and permanent alterations in
                    their structure, including emphysema, are the result.</p>
                <p>3. Emphysema also arises from exertion involving violent expiratory efforts,
                    during which the glottis is constricted, as in paroxysms of coughing, in
                    straining, and in lifting heavy weights. Hooping cough is well known as the
                    exciting cause of emphysema in many persons.</p>
                <p>In whatever manner produced, this disease gives rise to important morbid changes
                    in the affected portions of the lungs, especially the loss of the natural
                    elasticity of the air-cells, and likewise the destruction of many of the
                    pulmonary capillary blood-vessels, and the diminution of aerating surface for
                    the blood. As a consequence of these, other changes are apt to arise affecting
                    related organs, more particularly the heart and the venous system generally, one
                    of the most frequent results of which is the occurrence of dropsy. The chief
                    symptom in this complaint is shortness of breathing, more or less constant but
                    greatly aggravated by exertion, and by attacks of bronchitis, to which persons
                    suffering from emphysema appear to be specially liable. The respiration is of
                    similar character to that already described in the case of asthma. In severe
                    forms of the disease the patient comes to acquire a peculiar <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n190/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0190-0181"/> puffy or bloated appearance, and the
                    configuration of the chest is altered, assuming the character known as the
                    barrel-shaped or emphysematous thorax.</p>
                <p>The main element in the treatment of emphysema consists in attention to the
                    general condition of the health, and in the avoidance of all causes likely to
                    aggravate the disease or induce its complications. The same general plan of
                    treatment as that recommended in asthma and bronchitis is applicable in
                    emphysema. During attacks of urgent breathlessness antispasmodic remedies should
                    be had recourse to, while the employment of dry cupping over the lungs, and even
                    of moderate wet cupping over the precordium, will often afford marked and speedy
                    relief.</p>
                <p>Interlobular emphysema, arising from the rupture of air-cells in the immediate
                    neighbourhood of the pleura, may occur as a complication of the vesicular form,
                    or separately as the result of some sudden expulsive effort, such as a fit of
                    coughing, or, as has frequently happened, in parturition Occasionally the air
                    infiltrates the cellular tissue of the mediastinum, and thence comes to distend
                    the integument of the whole surface of the body. When occurring suddenly and
                    extensively, this has been known to produce death by asphyxia.</p>
