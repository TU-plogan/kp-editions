                    accompanying notice. The recruit is then entitled to be billeted, and must, in
                    not less than twenty-four and not more than ninety-six hours, appear before a
                    magistrate (who is not a military officer) to be attested as a soldier or to
                    object to his enlistment. If the recruit objects and satisfies the magistrate
                    that the enlistment was irregular, he is discharged, and the matter réported to
                    the military authorities; if the recruit objects, but the enlistment was
                    regular, he must repay the enlisting money and any pay or allowances he may have
                    received, and 20s. of smart money, and is then discharged. If the recruit does
                    not object, or cannot pay the money, the questions in the form of attestation
                    are again put by the magistrate, who also administers the·oath of allegiance. If
                    the recruit does not appear, he may be punished as a rogue or vagabond. Before
                    this attestation the recruit is not subject to court-martial, but fraudulent
                    conduct followed by attestation is punished either by the justices of the peace
                    or by the district or garrison court-martial. Every attempt by an undischarged
                    soldier or volunteer to re-enlist is punishable as desertion; but in the case of
                    militiamen the penalty is generally a stoppage of Id. or 2d. of weekly pay for a
                    certain period. It is from the date of attestation that the period of service
                    for pension or discharge runs. The above provisions apply to enlistment in the
                    United Kingdom of natural born subjects. The Mutiny Act makes special provision
                    for enlistment abroad and for the enlistment of negroes or coloured persons who
                    are not subjects of Her Majesty by birth, or who have been condemned as prize
                    under the Slave Trade Acts. A master wishing to recover an apprentice or
                    indentured labourer who has enlisted must claim him within a month after
                    enlistment. The apprentice is not only punished for w rongful enlisting, but
                    remains liable to serve in the army at the end of his apprenticeship, and indeed
                    may be punished as a deserter if lie does not deliver himself up as a recruit.
                    Much the same rules will be found in the Marine Mutiny Act. The enlistment oath
                    for the militia is contained in the Militia Service Act, 36 and 37 Vict. c. 68,
                    The period of service implied in enlistment is now regulated by the Army
                    Enlistment Act, 1870, 33 and 34 Vict. c. 67, repealed as regards compulsory <hi
                    rend="italic">general</hi> enlistment by the Mutiny Act, 1876. Long service is
                    always for twelve years. Short service in the cavalry, artillery, and engineers
                    is eight years army and four years reserve; in the infantry and army service
                    corps, six years army and six years reserve. For the army hospital corps and the
                    colonial corps there is no short service. In 1870 it was said that this scheme
                    would require 322,449 recruits annually, and that in eight years a reserve of
                    81,811 would be created. The average enlistment is only about 20,000, but this
                    is largely accounted for by the inducements given to enter the militia. In early
                    times attendance at the <hi rend="italic">posse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >comitatus</hi> was enforced by the penalty of <hi rend="italic"
                    >culvertage,</hi> or turntail, viz., forfeiture of property and perpetual
                    servitude. The organization of this levy will be found in the Assize of Arms (27
                    Hen. II.) and the Statute of Winchester (13 Edw. I.), which apply to all men
                    between the ages of fifteen and sixty. By a later Act (4 and 5 Philip and Mary),
                    commissioners of musters were appointed. When the feudal system of escuage was
                    on the wane, Edward III. introduced a custom of “indenting” with private persons
                    to furnish soldiers at certain rates of wage. Many of such indentures of Henry
                    V.’s time, printed in Hunter’s <hi rend="italic">Critical and Historical
                    Tracts,</hi> vol. i., appear to be agreements for one year in consideration of
                    <hi rend="italic">gages et</hi><hi rend="italic">regards,</hi> or pay and
                    bounty, at certain rates, 6d. a day for an archer and Is. for a man at arms. The
                    parties agree about sharing the <hi rend="italic">gaignes de guerre,</hi>
                    prisoners and booty. A quarter’s wages, called <hi rend="italic">prest
                    money,</hi> is paid in advance. Not till the time of Henry VII. was “coat and
                    conduct money” added to this mere bounty on joining. From time to time general
                    pardons were given to all felons who would serve in the army, and even so late
                    as 1703 a statute freed all insolvent debtors who would serve. The Welsh,
                    Cornish, and Irish made up a large proportion of the recruits of the early
                    English armies. (See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Army,</hi> vol. ii. p. 574).</p>
