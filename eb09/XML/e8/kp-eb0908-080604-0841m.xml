                    civilization of the introduction of explosive agents for the purposes of war.
                    Some eminent authors have gone so far as to consider the invention of gunpowder
                    as next in importance, in its ultimate effects, to those of printing and the
                    application of steam power. However this may be, it is well to remember that
                    explosive substances are now of immense utility in the arts of peace; indeed, it
                    is not too much to say that without their aid many of the great engineering
                    enterprises of the present day would either be impossible, or else have to be
                    carried out at a vast additional expenditure of time and labour.</p>
                <p>The germ of all the knowledge of explosive reaction we possess undoubtedly lay in
                    the probably accidental discovery, many ages ago, of the deflagrating properties
                    of the natural substance nitre or saltpetre (KNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>),
                    when in con-act with incandescent charcoal. To trace the consequences <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n842/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0842-0807"/> of that discovery, very gradual as they have
                    been, and intimately bound up with the progress of chemical and mechanical
                    science, belongs rather to an article on gunpowder; but the fact may be briefly
                    referred to in connexion with the second great epoch in the history of explosive
                    substances. By distilling nitre with oil of vitriol, the alchemists obtained a
                    corrosive fluid which they called <hi rend="italic">aquafortis,</hi> now known
                    as nitric acid (HNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), which parts with its oxygen
                    even more readily than saltpetre; so that if the strongest nitric acid be poured
                    upon finely powdered charcoal, the latter takes fire at the ordinary
                    temperature. Somewhat less than half a century back, it was discovered by some
                    French chemists that upon treating various organic substances, such as starch,
                    the sugars, cotton fabrics, and even paper, with concentrated nitric acid under
                    proper precautions, the chemical constitution of the substances underwent a
                    great change, and they became endowed with violently explosive properties, while
                    remaining for the most part unaltered in external characteristics. To this
                    discovery we owe a distinct class of explosive compounds, the most powerful for
                    practical purposes as yet known; their general formation and properties will be
                    noticed in due course.</p>
                <p>We will now proceed to examine into those principles of constitution and action
                    which are more or less common to all explosive substances.</p>
                <p>As the term is often rather loosely employed, “explosion” may for our purpose be
                    defined as the sudden or extremely rapid conversion of a solid or liquid body of
                    small bulk into gas or vapour, occupying very many times the volume of the
                    original substance, and, in addition, highly expanded by the heat generated
                    during the transformation. This sudden or very rapid expansion of volume is
                    attended by an exhibition of force, more or less violent according to the
                    constitution of the original substance and the circumstances of explosion. Any
                    substance capable of undergoing such a change upon the application of heat, or
                    other disturbing cause, is called “explosive.”</p>
                <p>The explosive substances that are practically the most important essentially
                    contain carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, the last always existing in a state of
                    feeble combination with the whole or part of the oxygen, and thus creating that
                    condition of unstable chemical equilibrium which is necessary. When explosion
                    takes place, the nitrogen parts with its oxygen to the carbon, for which it has
                    a great affinity, forming carbonic acid (CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) and
                    carbonic oxide (CO) gases, the combination being accompanied with great
                    generation of heat, and the nitrogen gas is set free. In most explosives there
                    is also hydrogen accompanying the carbon, and by its combustion producing an
                    extremely high temperature; it combines with part of the oxygen to form water in
                    the form of greatly expanded vapour. Other subordinate elements are often
                    present; in guupowder, for instance, the potassium binds the nitrogen and oxygen
                    loosely together in the state of saltpetre, and there is sulphur, a second
                    combustible, whose oxidation evolves greater heat than that of carbon. When
                    chlorate of potash is present, the chlorine plays the part of the nitrogen, and
                    is set free in the gaseous state. Two very unstable and practically useless
                    explosive substances, the so-called chloride and iodide of nitrogen, contain
                    neither carbon nor oxygen; but their great violence is equally caused by the
                    feeble affinities of nitrogen for other elements, large volumes of gaseous
                    matter being suddenly disengaged from a very small quantity of a liquid and
                    solid body respectively.</p>
                <p>Explosives may be conveniently divided into two distinct classes,—(1) explosive
                    mixtures, and (2) explosive compounds.</p>
                <p>The first class consists of those explosive substances which are merely intimate
                    mechanical mixtures of certain ingredients, and which can be again separated
                    more or less completely by mechanical means, not involving chemical action.
                    These ingredients do not, as a rule, possess explosive properties in their
                    separate condition. There are, however, explosives which might almost be classed
                    in both categories; for example, <hi rend="italic">picric powder</hi> is
                    composed of ammonium picrate and saltpetre, the former of which contains an
                    explosive molecule, but is mixed with the latter to supply additional oxygen,
                    and thus increase the force.</p>
                <p>If a substance that will burn freely in air, combining gradually with the oxygen
                    of the atmosphere, be ignited in pure oxygen gas, the combustion will be much
                    more rapid, and the amount of heat generated greater, at the ordinary
                    atmospheric pressure. If it be possible to burn the sub stance in a very
                    condensed atmosphere of oxygen, we can readily imagine the combustion being very
                    greatly accelerated, and therefore increased in violence; this is what is
                    ordinarily effected by an explosive “mixture.” A combustible body and a
                    supporter of combustion are brought into extremely close contact with one
                    another, by means of intimate mechanical mixture; also, the supporter of
                    combustion, or oxidizing agent, is present in a very concentrated form,
                    constituting what may be termed a magazine of condensed oxygen, solid or liquid.
                    In the case of the explosion of a definite chemical compound, the change may be
                    considered as the resolution of a complex body into simpler forms; this is not,
                    however, always the case when a mechanical mixture is concerned: gunpowder, for
                    example, may be said to contain two elementary substances, carbon and sulphur,
                    not in chemical union.</p>
                <p>The chief explosive mixtures may be subdivided into “nitrate mixtures,” and
                    “chlorate mixtures.”</p>
                <p>In the nitrates, the oxygen is held in combination with sufficient force to need
                    a powerful disturbing cause to separate it, so that mixtures made from nitrates
                    do not explode very readily, and their action is comparatively gradual; they are
                    not sensitive to friction or percussion, and hence are tolerably safe. Any of
                    the nitrates will form explosive mixtures with combustible substances, but
                    nitrate of potash (KNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) is the only one practically
                    employed. The nitrate of soda, called “cubical” or Chili saltpetre, has been
                    used, but absorbs moisture from the air so readily as to give very inferior
                    results. Gunpowder may be taken as the representative of the nitrate explosive
                    mixtures. Picric powder, above referred to, has been proposed by Abel for use as
                    a bursting charge for shells, as being more powerful than a corresponding charge
                    of gunpowder, equally safe as regards friction or percussion, and less
                    hygroscopic; it consists of two parts ammonium picrate, and three parts
                    saltpetre, incorporated, pressed, and finished very much as ordinary
                    gunpowder.</p>
                <p>The chlorates part with their oxygen far more readily than the nitrates, the
                    strong affinities of chlorine for the metals coming into play, and consequently
                    chlorate mixtures are very sensitive to friction and percussion, and explode
                    with great violence; chlorate of potash (KClO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) is
                    the only one used. Very many chlorate mixtures have been made, some of which are
                    employed in fireworks. “White gunpowder” is a mixture of two parts chlorate of
                    potash, one of yellow prussiate of potash, and one of sugar; it is exploded very
                    easily by friction or percussion. The most important chlorate mixtures are those
                    used for igniting other explosives, such as the composition for friction tubes
                    for firing cannon, percussion cap composition, and percussion fuzes for bursting
                    shells on impact; it is sometimes mixed with sulphur, as a combustible, and
                    sometimes with black sulphide of antimony, which gives a longer flame.</p>
                <p>In an explosive “compound,” the elements are all in chemical combination,
                    presenting a definite explosive “molecule,” which contains, so to speak, both
                    the combustible<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n843/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0843-0808"/> and the supporter of combustion, in the closest
                    possible union; we can therefore understand its action being much more sudden
                    and violent than that of the most intimate mechanical mixture.</p>
                <p>The chief explosive compounds are formed from some organic substance containing
                    carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, by introducing into it, through the action of
                    concentrated nitric acid, a certain portion of nitric peroxide (NO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), in substitution for an equivalent amount of hydrogen.
                    A new compound, differing outwardly very little, if at all, from the original
                    substance, is thus formed, but in a very unstable state of chemical equilibrium,
                    because of the feeble union of the nitrogen and oxygen in the NO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> molecule. A slight disturbing cause brings into play
                    the stronger affinity of the carbon and hydrogen for the large store of oxygen
                    contained in the new compound. Gun-cotton and nitro-glycerin are the leading
                    members of this group, being produced in a precisely similar manner, by the
                    substitution of three molecules of NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> for three
                    atoms of hydrogen (H). As those explosives will be elsewhere described in
                    detail, we give the formation, as a representative member of the group, of
                    nitro-phenol, or picric acid, by treating phenol, or carbolic acid, with a
                    mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, the latter being required to absorb the
                    water, and preserve the full strength of the nitric acid :—</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">tri-nitro</hi> substitution product. Only the picrates, or
                    salts of picric acid formed with potassium or ammonium, are used in practice, as
                    possessing more force than the uncombined acid. From starch can be obtained, in
                    a strictly analogous manner, an explosive called <hi rend="italic"
                    >xyloidine,</hi> which is a <hi rend="italic">bi-nitro</hi> product, two
                    molecules of nitric peroxide being substituted for two atoms of hydrogen. In the
                    case of <hi rend="italic">nitro-mannite,</hi> an explosive made from mannite,
                    one of the sugars, as many as six molecules of the NO <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> are inserted. The number of nitro-substitution products is very great,
                    many of them being more or less violently explosive.</p>
                <p>The fulminates are among the most violent of all explosive compounds, their
                    chemical stability being very small. Sudden in action, their effect is great
                    locally; thus they are well adapted to the purpose, for which alone they are
                    practically used, of igniting, or upsetting the equilibrium of, other
                    explosives.</p>
                <p>Fulminate of mercury is produced by adding alcohol (C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O), under careful precautions, to a
                    solution of mercury in nitric acid; a grey crystalline precipitate is obtained,
                    very heavy (sp. gr. 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4), and so sensitive to
                    friction or percussion that it is kept in the wet state. The results of analysis
                    show one atom of mercury, and two each of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, so that
                    the formula may be empirically written HgC <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, or perhaps more
                    correctly HgO.C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O;
                    the chemical factor C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> N <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O is called <hi rend="italic">fulminic acid,</hi> but has never been
                    produced separately. Opinions differ as to the precise “rational” formulae of
                    the fulminates, some chemists considering their process of formation to be
                    similar to that of the nitro-substitution products. It will be observed that two
                    atoms of nitrogen take the place of hydrogen, being the ratio of combining
                    proportions of those elements. The products of combustion are carbonic oxide,
                    nitrogen, and metallic mercury, and the violence of action is due to the sudden
                    evolution of a volume of ga3 and vapour very large in comparison with that of
                    the substance, its density being so great. This fulminate enters into the
                    composition used for percussion caps and electric fuzes; its practical value has
                    of late years been immensely increased by the discovery of its power, even in
                    very small quantities, to proαuce the almost instantaneous decomposition of
                    several explosive substances.</p>
                <p>Fulminate of silver is prepared in a similar manner, but, being far more
                    sensitive, is of little practical value; it is employed, in very minute
                    quantities, in making such toys as detonating crackers.</p>
                <p>The difficulties in the way of estimating, with any accuracy, the <hi
                    rend="italic">force</hi> of explosive substances are very great, especially as
                    no definite standard of comparison can be laid down. However, by means of
                    theoretical considerations, combined with the results of actual experiment, a
                    tolerably fair approximation may be arrived at.</p>
                <p>When an explosive substance is exploded in a closed vessel sufficiently strong to
                    resist rupture, the tension attains its maximum value in an extremely short
                    space of time and gradually decreases from the heat being conducted away by the
                    metal envelope, and dispersed by radiation. It has, however, been demonstrated
                    that, at the moment of maximum tension, the loss of pressure due to the
                    communication of heat to the vessel, if the latter be filled with the explosive,
                    is less than one per cent. The products of combustion, after cooling down, can
                    easily be determined by analysis, and are then either (a) wholly gaseous, as for
                    chloride or iodide of nitrogen; (δ) gaseous and liquid, in the case of
                    gun-cotton and nitro-glycerin; or (c) gaseous and solid, as with gunpowder. It
                    is certain that, at the moment of explosion, the products of the more violent
                    explosive compounds are wholly in a state of gas or vapour, but we should arrive
                    at incorrect results by making the same assumption in the case of a mechanical
                    mixture like gunpowder. The experiments of Noble and Abel on “Fired Gunpowder”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans. Poy. Soc.,</hi> 1874), which are the most
                    complete ever undertaken, show that the ultimately solid residue is, at the
                    moment of explosion, in a liquid state, and most probably in a very finely
                    divided condition; moreover, that, at that instant, it occupies a space the

                <p>We have no certain means of directly estimating the temperature of explosion, but
                    if it be assumed, as is usually done, to be the temperature the total products
                    of combustion would attain to if the whole amount of heat generated by the
                    explosion were applied to raise them, under constant volume, from absolute zero,
                    we have the relation</p>
                <p>H-Tc,, in which H represents the number of units of heat generated, and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> the specific heat under constant volume of the united
                    products, gaseous or otherwise. The quantity of heat can be obtained by
                    experiment, and this livided by the specific heat, will give the temperature.
                    The chief sources of error lie in the assumption that the specific heat remains
                    constant throughout the great range of temperature in question, and in the
                    additional quantities of heat disengaged by secondary reactions. The value of T
                    thus found probably will therefore be higher than the real temperature.</p>
                <p>Having regard to the above reasoning, it may be <hi rend="italic">generally</hi>
                    concluded that the amount of force exerted by an explosive substance depends
                    upon—(1) the <hi rend="italic">volume of gas or vapour</hi> produced by the
                    transformation, compared with that of the original substance; and (2) the <hi
                    rend="italic">temperature of explosion,</hi> which determines the extent to
                    which the gases are expanded, or their tension increased; or, in other words,
                    the explosive force is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> proportional to the heat
                    of combustion, and the volume of gas and vapour calculated at 0° C. and 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 60 mm. pressure, and <hi rend="italic">inversely</hi>
                    proportional to the specific heat of the mixed products.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed by Berthelot and others that the volume of gas produced may
                    possibly be still further increased by the partial or total “dissociation” of
                    the compound gases, at the high temperatures concerned; for example, that the
                    carbonic acid (CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) may be decomposed into carbonic
                    oxide (CO) and oxygen, or the aqueous vapour into oxygen and hydrogen. However,
                    Noble and Abel demonstrate that, in the former instance, the loss of
                    temperature, consequent upon the absorption of heat by the decomposition, would
                    more than compensate for the increase of volume by dissociation. It must also be
                    remembered that, if the temperature be extremely high, so also is the pressure
                    under which dissociation must take place. We may therefore consider that it has
                    no sensible influence upon the explosive force.</p>
                <p>It is most important to distinguish between explosive force and explosive effect,
                    the latter in great measure depending upon the rapidity with which the
                    metamorphosis takes place, while the same amount of force may be exerted
                    suddenly or gradually. We may, therefore, consider that the explosive effect
                    varies <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> as the volume of gas produced and the
                    temperature of explosion, and <hi rend="italic">inversely</hi> as the time
                    required for the transformation. But the time, and, to a certain extent, the
                    products and temperature, will vary with—(a.) the physical state of the
                    explosive substance; (δ.) the external conditions under which it is fired; (c.)
                    the mode of firing or exploding.</p>
                <p>I The physical or mechanical state of the explosive substance has a most
                    important bearing upon the effect obtained from it. To prove this, it is only
                    necessary to point to the very different results given by gunpowders made with
                    the same proportions of the three ingredients, but varying in density, and in
                    shape and size of grains or pieces. Gun-cotton is even more affected by
                    variations in mechanical condition. In the form of loose wool, it burns so
                    rapidly that gunpowder in contact with it is not inflamed; plaited or twisted
                    tightly, its rate of combustion in air is greatly modified. This is due to the
                    fact that the inflammable carbonic oxide, which is evolved by the decomposition
                    from the want of sufficient stored-up oxygen to oxidize completely all the
                    carbon of the gun-cotton, cannot penetrate between the fibres and accelerate the
                    combustion, but burns with a bright flame away from the surface of the twisted
                    cotton; when the yarn is yet more compressed by any means, the temperature is
                    not kept up to the height necessary for the combustion of the carbonic oxide, so
                    that it escapes unconsumed, abstracting heat, and yet more retarding the rate of
                    burning. For the same reason, pulped and compressed gun-cotton burns
                    comparatively slowly in air, even when dry; in the wet state, it merely
                    smoulders away, as the portions in contact with the fire successively become
                    dried. Yet this same wet compressed gun-cotton can be so used as to constitute
                    one of the most powerful explosives known.</p>
                <p>It is well known that gunpowder behaves differently when fired in the open air
                    and under strong confinement; not only the rate of burning, but even, to a
                    certain extent, the products of combustion are altered. We have discussed the
                    effect of tightly plaiting or compressing guncotton; but, when confined in a
                    strong envelope, the whole of the inflamed gas, being unable to escape outwards,
                    is forced into the interstices under immense pressure, and the decomposition
                    greatly accelerated. The amount of confinement or restraint needed by any
                    explosive depends, however, upon the nature of the substance and the mode of
                    exploding it, becoming very much less as the transformation is more rapid, until
                    it may be said to reach the vanishing point. For example, the very violent
                    explosive chloride of nitrogen is usually surrounded, when exploded, with a thin
                    film of water; Abel states that if this film, not exceeding ∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> n</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> inch in thickness, be
                    removed, the explosive effect is much lessened. Nitroglycerin, again, when
                    detonated by a fulminate, is sufficiently confined by the surrounding
                    atmosphere. By the same means, gun-cotton may be exploded unconfined, if
                    compressed, the mechanical coh esion affording sufficient restraint. In the case
                    of wet compressed gun-cotton, which can be detonated with evcn fuller effect
                    than dry, the mechanical resistance is greater, the air-spaces being filled with
                    incompressible fluid.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the explosion is brought about has a most important bearing
                    upon the effect produced. This may be done by the direct application of an
                    ignited or heated body, by the use of an electric current to heat a fine
                    platinum wire, or by means of percussion, concussion, or friction, converting
                    mechanical energy into heat. A small quantity of a subsidiary explosive, such as
                    a composition sensitive to friction or percussion, is often employed, for the
                    sake of convenience, to ignite the main charge, the combustion spreading through
                    the mass with more or less rapidity, according to the nature of the
                    substance.</p>
                <p>Although subsidiary or initiatory explosives were at first used merely to
                    generate sufficient heat to ignite the charge, and are often still so employed,
                    they have of late years received an application of far wider importance. Mr
                    Alfred Nobel, a Swedish engineer, while endeavouring to employ nitro-glycerin
                    for practical purposes, found considerable difficulty in exploding it with
                    certainty; he at length, in 18G4, by using a large percussion cap, charged with
                    fulminate of mercury, obtained an explosion of great violence. This result led
                    to the discovery that many explosive substances, when exploded by means of a
                    small quantity of a suitable initiatory explosive, produce an effect far
                    exceeding anything that can be attributed to the ordinary combustion, however
                    rapid, of the body in question; in fact, the whole mass of the explosive is
                    converted into gas with such suddenness that it may, practically, be considered
                    instantaneous; this sudden transformation is termed “detonation.” Of the
                    substances <pb break="no"

                    mercury is the most important.</p>
                <p>Some explosives appear always to detonate, in whatever manner they may be
                    exploded, such as chloride and iodide of nitrogen; the explosive effect is
                    therefore much greater than that of a slower explosive substance, although their
                    explosive force may be less. Again, other substances, such as gun-cotton and
                    nitro-glycerin, are detonated or not according to the mode of explosion. Indeed,
                    Abel has proved that most explosives, including gunpowder, can be detonated,
                    provided the proper initiatory charge be employed. Roux and Sarrau <hi
                    rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1874) have divided explosions into two
                    classes or orders,—“detonations” or explosions of the first order, and “simple
                    explosions” of the second order. They made a series of experiments with the
                    object of determining the comparative values of various explosive substances,
                    detonated, and exploded in the ordinary manner; the method employed was to
                    ascertain the quantity of each just sufficient to produce rupture in small
                    spherical shells of equal strength. The following table gives the comparative
                    results for the three most important explosive substances :—</p>

                <p>These experiments, although valuable, cannot be considered as affording a precise
                    method of comparison; the results would be affected, <hi rend="italic">inter
                    alia,</hi> by the impossibility of ensuring that the shells were all of the same
                    strength, a point of great importance, considering the very small weights of
                    each explosive used; also the rate of combustion, and therefore the explosive
                    effect, of gunpowder is materially affected by its mechanical condition, so that
                    different powders would give a varying standard of comparison. However, they
                    afford fair evidence that, when detonated, gun-cotton has about six times, and
                    pure nitro-glycerin about ten times the local explosive effect of gunpowder
                    simply ignited in the ordinary manner; nitro-glycerin is usually employed in the
                    form of “dynamite,” mixed with some inert absorbent substance, so that its power
                    is proportionately reduced.</p>
                <p>The rationale of detonation is not yet understood. If the transformation were due
                    merely to the mechanical energy of the particles of gas, liberated from the
                    initiatory charge at a tremendous velocity, being converted into heat by impact
                    against the mass of the explosive substance, then it would follow that the most
                    powerful explosive would be the best detonating agent; this is, however, by no
                    means the case, for a few grains of fulminate of mercury in a metal tube will
                    detonate gun-cotton, whereas nitro-glycerin, although possessed of more
                    explosive force, will not do so unless used in large quantities. The fact of its
                    being possible to detonate wet gun-cotton is also a proof that the action cannot
                    be due to heat alone. It would rather seem to be what Professor Bloxam terms
                    “sympathetic” explosion; the experiments of Abel, as well as those of Champion
                    and Pellet in France, appear to indicate a vibratory action of the detonating
                    agent upon the ultimate particles of the substance to be exploded. An explosive
                    molecule is most unstable, certain very delicately balanced forces preserving
                    the chemical and physical equilibrium of the compound. If these forces be
                    rapidly overthrown in succession, we have explosion; but when, by a blow of a
                    certain kind, they are instantaneously destroyed, the result is detonation. J
                    ust as a glass globe may withstand a strong blow, but be shattered by the
                    vibration of a particular note, so it is considered by some authorities that, in
                    the instance cited, the fulminate of mercury communicates a vibration to which
                    the gun-cotton molecule is sensitive, and which overthrows its equilibrium; it
                    is not sensitive to the vibrations caused by the nitro-glycerin, which only
                    tears and scatters it mechanically. Although the action of detonation has been
                    spoken of as instantaneous, and may practically be so considered, yet a certain
                    infinitesimal duration of time is required for the metamorphosis; different
                    substances possess, doubtless, different rates of detonation, for we can
                    scarcely conceive of a mechanical mixture, such as gunpowder, being so sensitive
                    to the action of the detonating impulse as a definite chemical compound, and the
                    rate even varies slightly, for the same explosive, with its physical state. It
                    has been shown, by means of Captain A. Noble’s chronoscope, that compressed
                    gun-cotton, when dry, is detonated at a velocity of from 17,000 to 18,000 feet a
                    second, or about 200 miles a minute; by using a small primer of dry gun-cotton,
                    the same substance in the wet state may be detonated at the increased rate of
                    from 18,000 to 21,000 feet a second, or about 240 miles a minute.</p>
                <p>The following results are taken from experiments on detonation and its
                    applications, carried out by F. A. Abel, C.B., F.R.S.</p>

                    detonation of an explosive substance—(a) Quality of the initial detonation; (b)
                    Resistance to mechanical dispersion offered by the mass of the substance to be
                    detonated.</hi></p>
                <p>1. A fuze containing rather more than 1 oz. gunpowder, strongly confined,
                    exploded in contact with a mass of compressed gun-cotton, only inflames it,
                    although the explosion of the fuze is apparently a sharp one.</p>
                <p>2. Forty-five grains of fulminate of mercury, exploded unconfined on the surface
                    of a piece of compressed gun-cotton, only inflames or disperses it.</p>
                <p>3. A fuze containing 9 grains fulminate of mercury, strongly confined, exploded
                    in contact with compressed gun-cotton, or dynamite, detonates it with
                    certainty.</p>
                <p>4. An equal quantity of fulminate, similarly confined, does not detonate
                    uncompressed gun-cotton in which it is imbedded, but merely disperses and
                    inflames it.</p>
                <p>5. 150 grains compressed gun-cotton, detonated in proximity to dynamite,
                    detonates the latter.</p>
                <p>6. 3 oz. of dynamite, and very much larger quantities, detonated in contact with
                    compressed gun-cotlon only disperses it</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Transmission of Detonation.</hi></p>
                <p>7. Detonation being established at one extremity of a continuous row of distinct
                    masses of compressed gun-cotton, or dynamite, travels the whole length thereof.
                    Stretching insulating wires across the row of discs, at intervals of six feet,
                    their rapture by the detonation gives spark-records on the cylinder of Noble’s
                    chronoscope, by means of which the rate of transmission can be calculated.</p>
                <p>8. A row of gun-cotton discs, of any length, placed 0 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 5 inch apart, can all be detonated from one end.</p>
                <p>9. Discs of compressed gun-cotton, weighing about 8 oz. each, being placed 6
                    inches apart, the detonation of the central dis only blows away or breaks up the
                    neighbouring masses.</p>
                <p>10. About 2 oz. compressed gun-cotton being inserted into one extremity of a
                    wrought-iron tube 5 feet long, its detonation is transmitted to a disc of
                    compressed gun-cotton inserted into the other extremity of the tube.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Applications of Detonation.</hi></p>
                <p>11. A wrought iron rail can be destroyed by detonating 8 oz. of compressed
                    gun-cotton placed unconfined upon the rail.</p>
                <p>12. A piece of wet gun-cotton, quite uninflammable, removed from a fire and
                    detonated upon a block of granite, using, a small primer of dry gun-cotton,
                    shatters the block.</p>
                <p>13. A stockade can be destroyed by means of a flat th arge built up of wet
                    gun-cotton slabs,—detonation being established by means of a small portion of
                    the charge in a dry state.</p>
                <p>14. A submerged charge of wet gun-cotton, open on all sides to the water, and
                    merely confined around the dry initiative charge, or primer, by means of a net,
                    can be detonated.</p>
                <p>Many attempts have been made, especially by foreign chemists and physicists, to
                    arrive at an exact determination of the comparative force of explosive
                    substances. The <pb break="no"

                    headings of (1) experiment alone, and (2) calculation and experiment combined.
                    In the first category may be placed the experiments of Roux and Sarrau, already
                    noticed. By the second method, Berthelot <hi rend="italic">{Force</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Poudre et Matières</hi><hi rend="italic">Explosives,</hi>
                    1872) calculates the volume of gases which would be produced, and having
                    ascertained the quantity of heat generated by the explosion, considers that
                    their product affords a term of comparison according fairly well with the
                    results of experiment. Sarrau <hi rend="italic">{Effets de la poudre et des
                    substances explosives)</hi> 1874), from a train of reasoning somewhat similar to
                    that here followed, arrives at the conclusion that the explosive force is nearly
                    proportional to the product of the heat of combustion by the weight of permanent
                    gases produced; he obtains both these data by experiments carried out at the
                    Dépôt central des Manufactures de l’Etat. The following table shows the results
                    of the two methods:—</p>

                <p>The plan pursued by Sarrau appears the more reliable of the two, in that he
                    obtains by experiment the quantity of permanent gases evolved; the relative
                    proportions he gives agree fairly well with those experimentally determined by
                    him, in conjunction with Roux, for simple explosion. With reference to
                    Berthelot’s figures, it is a well known fact that nitro-glycerin, when not
                    detonated, is very uncertain in its action, so that in all probability it would
                    never give its full theoretic force; Sarrau seems nearer its correct value. On
                    the other hand, chlorine gas, liberated by the explosion of chlorate of potash
                    and chloride of nitrogen, is very heavy, so that considerable variation may
                    arise from estimating it by weight instead of volume. The mean of the results
                    given by five descriptions of gunpowder was adopted by Sarrau as his standard,
                    and he estimates the pressure at about 5290 atmospheres. Noble and Abel have
                    proved these figures to be considerably too low; and we shall, in all
                    probability, be not far wrong if we multiply each of the ratios given in
                    Sarrau’s table by G000, in order roughly to show the pressure, in atmospheres,
                    of equal weights of each of the substances in question exploded in about its own
                    volume, but not detonated.</p>
                <p>We have considered the tension developed in a close vessel of constant volume.
                    Let us now investigate the case of the products of combustion being allowed to
                    expand in a vessel impervious to heat, it having been conclusively proved that
                    with large charges the loss of heat by communication to the metal of a gun is
                    relatively very small, and may practically be neglected. If V, P, and T be
                    respectively the initial volume occupied by the substance, the maximum pressure,
                    and the temperature of explosion, we shall deduce expressions for the pressure
                    and temperature corresponding to any volume <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and the
                    work done by the expansion of the permanent gases in the space <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi>- V. It will simplify the calculation if we suppose that the gravimetric
                    density of the substance is unity, that it fills the volume in which it is
                    exploded, and that the charge is burnt before it commences to do work, either
                    upon a projectile or otherwise; even with gunpowder the correction due to this
                    last assumption is not great, and the action of the more violent explosives may
                    practically be considered instantaneous, especially when detonated. It has
                    already been stated that, with most explosives, there is an ultimately solid or
                    liquid residue, the products not being wholly gaseous; with gunpowder this
                    residue is very considerable.</p>
                <p>As before, let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the ratio of the volume of the
                    non-gaseous products at the instant of explosion; then the original volume of
                    gas and vapour will be V(l -p), and the expanded volume <hi rend="italic"
                    >ν-pV;</hi> lor the sake of brevity these corrections will be made at the end of
                    the calculations. As already stated, for gunpowder the value of p is about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6; it is relatively inconsiderable for the more
                    violent explosive compounds.</p>

                    >pv=Rt. . '.</hi> (1), if we suppose the pressure to remain constant while the

                <p>This expression for the work done is of considerable practical value in the case
                    of gunpowder, or any explosive which can be used as a propelling agent with
                    heavy guns. Knowing the length and diameter of the bore, we can calculate the
                    total maximum work due to a given weight of charge in expanding to that volume.
                    This maximum is of course not attained in practice, and it is therefore
                    necessary to multiply it by a ratio, or factor, dependent on the nature of the
                    gun and projectile, the powder used, mode of ignition, &lt;fcc. However, by
                    making use of the results of actual experiment, this “factor of effect,” or
                    percentage of work realized, can be determined with much accuracy. Its value is
                    greatest for very large guns, being 93 per cent, for the 38-ton gun, and
                    becoming as low as about <hi rend="italic">50</hi> per cent, in the case of the
                    little 7-pr. mountain gun of 150 lb. weight; the difference is chiefly due to
                    the loss of heat by communication to the metal of the gun. (See Noble and Abel
                    on “Fired Gunpowder.”)</p>
                <p>We can approximate to the “muzzle velocity,” or the velocity atwhich the
                    projectile leaves the bore, by substituting the value of W, found for the
                    particular gun, in the ordinary equation of work, W = , where V is the velocity,
                    and <hi rend="italic">w</hi> the weight of the projectile; we thence obtain <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi>-√ιV7.- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>If W, the maximum work due to the expansion of the gaseous products in the volume
                    of the bore, be multiplied by the factor of effect ∕, for the nature of gun and
                    powder used, the result will be very nearly the mean observed velocity.</p>
                <p>The mathematical expression for the work done by an explosive substance in
                    expanding from V to <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pdv,</hi>
                    evidently denotes the area of a plane curve; the work may therefore be
                    graphically represented by the area enclosed by a curve, having for its
                    ordinates the pressures in foot-tons, or atmospheres, and for abscissae the
                    corresponding volumes or spaces occupied by the gases.</p>
                <p>If, in equation (14), we take the limits between V and infinity, we arrive at a
                    very simple expression for the total theoretic work due to the indefinite
                    expansion of a given weight of any explosive substance, <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    becoming indefinitely great compared to the original volume V, and we have</p>
                <p>W = JH, (15), which may be called the “potential energy” of the explosive, being
                    the product of the total quantity of heat generated by the explosion and the
                    mechanical equivalent of heat. This .conclusion, within the assumptions made, is
                    in strict accordance with the principle of the mutual convertibility of energy
                    and heat.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the potential energy, in foot-tons, calculated from the
                    heat of combustion for each explosive, determined by Roux and Sarrau, in the
                    experiments already referred to; that for gunpowder is the mean given by five
                    kinds.</p>

                <p>The above figures naturally direct our attention to the small amount of work
                    stored up in even the most violent explosive substance, compared with the
                    potential energy of 1 lb. of coal, which is about 4980 foot-tons. Noble and Abel
                    point out that this great difference is not alone due to the fact that the coal
                    draws its oxygen from the air, but also because the explosive has to expend a
                    considerable amount of work in converting its condensed magazine of oxygen into
                    gas, before it can combine with the carbon; further, with reference to the
                    economic value of the work done, that the oxygen used by the coal costs nothing,
                    whereas much expense is incurred in condensing the oxygen into the explosive
                    substance.</p>
                <p>The practical value of any explosive must depend greatly upon the object to be
                    attained. It is essential to distinguish between explosive force and effect; the
                    more sudden the action the more local will be the effect produced, and hence the
                    very violent explosive substances are useless as propelling agents for heavy
                    guns or small arms, since they would destroy the weapon before overcoming the
                    inertia of the projectile. It is true that gun-cotton, prepared in various
                    forms, and mixed with other substances to moderate its action, as well as a
                    similar compound made from saw-dust, an inferior form of cellulose, are
                    sometimes used with small arms; but, in addition to a want of uniformity in
                    action, the strain caused by such substances would be far too great in the large
                    charges needed for heavy guns. Again, there are cases, even in mining or
                    blasting operations, for instance, when it is desired to displace large masses
                    of earth or soft rock, in which a comparatively slow explosive, such as
                    gunpowder, would give better results than gun-cotton or dynamite. However,
                    speaking generally, gunpowder in some one of its forms is far the most valuable
                    as a propelling agent, while, for destructive purposes, the last-named
                    substances are much more effective, especially when detonated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Baιv.—</hi> In 1860 an Act was passed “to amend the law
                    concerning the making, keeping, and carriage of gunpowder and compositions of an
                    explosive nature, and concerning the manufacture and use of fireworks” (23 and
                    24 Vict. c. 139), whereby previous Acts on the same subject were repealed, and
                    minute and stringent regulations introduced. Gunpowder may only be manufactured
                    in mills, lawfully used at the commencement of the Act, or duly licensed as in
                    this Act provided; other explosive compositions require a licence, and the
                    precautionary rules as to quantity, distance from dwelling houses, &amp;c., are
                    set forth in minute detail. No person may sell fireworks without a licence, or
                    to persons apparently under 16 years of age; and throwing fireworks on the
                    streets was made punishable by a penalty not exceeding £5. Other regulations
                    deal with carriage by land and sea, search-warrants, inspections of mills,
                    &amp;c. Amending Acts were passed in 1861 and 1862.</p>
                <p>In 1875 was passed the “Explosives Act” (38 Vict. c. 17), which repeals the
                    former Acts, and deals with the whole subject in a more comprehensive manner.
                    “Explosives’’are thus defined:—(1) Gunpowder, nitro-glycerin, dynamite,
                    gun-cotton, blasting powders, fulminate of mercury or of other metals, coloured
                    fires, and every other substance, whether similar to those above mentioned or
                    not, used or manufactured with a view to produce a practical effect by explosion
                    or a pyrotechnic effect, and including (2) fog-signals, fireworks, fuzes,
                    rockets, percussion caps, detonators, cartridges, ammunition of all
                    descriptions, and every adaptation or preparation of an explosive as above
                    defined. Part i. deals with gunpowder; part ii. with nitro-glycerin and other
                    explosives; part iii. with inspection, accidents, search, &amp;c.; part iv. with
                    various supplementary provisions. In addition to the licence required for
                    manufacturing gunpowder, it is provided that gunpowder shall not be kept in any
                    place except (1) a licensed factory, (2) a licensed magazine or store, or (3)
                    premises registered for keeping gunpowder. Private persons may keep gunpowder
                    for their own use to the amount of thirty pounds. Pules for the proper keeping
                    of gunpowder on such registered premises are prescribed. The Act contains 122
                    sections, and applies to Scotland and Ireland as well as England. It was based
                    on the report of a Committee of the House of Commons. Public opinion had been
                    greatly excited on the subject by the terrible explosion on the Kegent’s Canal
                    in 1874.</p>
                <p>Petroleum is governed by the Petroleum Act 1871—an annual Act, which has been
                    included every year in the Expiring Acts Continuance Bill.</p>
                <p>In 1877 the “Fisheries (Dynamite) Act” was passed, whereby any person who uses
                    dynamite or other explosive substance to catch or destroy fish in a public
                    fishery, shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £20, or
                    imprisonment for a term cf not more than two months.</p>
