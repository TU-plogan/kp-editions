                    really means a limited succession—one cut out by the will of the maker of the
                    entail from the ordinary legal course .of succession. The derivation of the word
                    from <hi rend="italic">talis</hi> (tales haeredes qui in tenore investiturae
                    contineantur) is now abandoned. But, as an existing social institution, entail
                    has also generally involved more or less restriction on the proprietary powers
                    of the heirs succeeding to the subject of entail. The policy of entails has
                    therefore been keenly discussed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the matter on legal principles entirely failed. On the one hand, in the language

                        >arbiter.</hi> This was said to imply an unlimited right to dictate the
                    conditions on which an estate was to be enjoyed after the death of its owner. On
                    the other hand, it was argued that on death the ownership must change, and that
                    the restrictions imposed on heirs of entail wereinconsiβtent with the nature of
                    property. These legal conceptions are themselves merely the products of
                    different states of society. A powerful and learned writer<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. de Laveleye, in his <hi rend="italic"
                                >De la Propriété et de ses formes primitives,</hi> Paris,
                        1874.</p></note> has recently shown that the notion of absolute and
                    exclusive private property is of quite modern date; and it may be added that the
                    power of testamentary disposition was unknown in primitive times, and has only
                    been very gradually admitted. In most civilized countries, so far as concerns
                    the creation of perpetuities, it is now being curtailed in obedience to those
                    considerations of social expediency which alone can decide the question of
                    entails. Conservative philosophers have maintained that the hope of founding a
                    family and an estate which will together be immortal is so great an incentive to
                    the higher forms of industry that the state cannot afford to do without it. But
                    the irresistible answer is that if you give this powerful motive to the founder
                    of a perpetuity, you take it away from every succeeding generation of his
                    descendants.. They are born to wealth which their idleness will not dissipate,
                    and possibly to social distinction which has not been earned by their exertions.
                    Besides, it is not disputed that perpetuities are opposed to the interest of the
                    state in the annual produce of the soil, which they place <hi rend="italic"

                    not be set aside; farmers were ousted of their leases made by tenants in tail;
                    for, if such leases had been valid, then under colour of long leases the issue
                    might have been virtually disinherited; creditors were defrauded of their debts;
                    for if tenant in tail could have charged his estate with their payment, he might
                    have also defeated his issue by mortgaging it for as much as it was worth;
                    innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the land they
                    had fairly bought—of suits in consequence of which our ancient books are full;
                    and treasons were encouraged—as estates-tail were not liable to forfeiture
                    longer than for the tenant’s life.” It is, indeed, obvious that, even if we
                    assume heirs of entail as a class to have been keenly alive to the duties or the
                    true interests of ownership, they had no power to improve their estates or to
                    assist their tenants in doing so. But even if entailed estates were managed so
                    as to yield the greatest possible amount of produce, it would still be a
                    misfortune, and a complete answer to the argument we have been considering, that
                    the land, so far as entailed, would be beyond the most ambitious hopes of the
                    mercantile and manufacturing community. Perpetuities have, however, been
                    defended on the perfectly distinct principle, not economical (in the narrower
                    sense), but broadly political, that they are essential to the permanent
                    well-being of an aristocracy. It is impossible here to discuss the advantages
                    resulting from the existence of an aristocratic caste, whether invested with the
                    hereditary privilege of legislation or regarded merely as contributing to
                    political life an element of safety and independence and culture and historical
                    continuity. These advantages, if they be facts, do not seem to be necessarily
                    connected with any particular system of land-laws, and in certain circumstances
                    a system of perpetuities might possibly impoverish and degrade a real
                    aristocracy. But it is certainly true that in the past the two institutions are
                    found in very close connection. Perhaps, in this view, the earliest type of an
                    entail occurs when, out of the common property of a tribe or other primitive
                    organization, some lands are given to a family who hold a public office or
                    exercise definite hereditary functions. In later times the connection is
                    sufficiently illustrated by the Carlovingian institution of τnq∕orα&lt;MS, which
                    spread through France and Italy and Spain, and which, like so many other
                    Carlovingian ideas, was reproduced by Napoleon in the tawdry magnificence of the
                    imperial decrees of 1808.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Hence, also, the various suggestions which have been made of a downward and an
                    upward limit to the property which should be required for a lawful entail of
                    certain dignities. In his essay on <hi rend="italic">Popular Discontents</hi>
                    Sir William Temple proposed, and Dr Johnson applauded the proposal, that every
                    baron should have at least £4000, every earl £6000, and every duke £8000 worth
                    of land. This idea has frequently been realized in practice. In Prussia an
                    entail was incompetent except of subjects above £400 in net annual value; in
                    Denmark the estate must be at least 200 fonder of hard corn, or 2000 acres in
                    extent; and under the Napoleonic system the <hi rend="italic">dotation</hi> of
                    the proposed entail, whether proceeding from the Government or from the
                    applicant himself, was always carefully fixed by the <hi rend="italic">Conseil

                    canon of construction laid down by the old Italian law, that a majoratus of such
                    subjects as palatium, turris, castrum, and even aedificium was easily
                        presumed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Joannie

                    kingdoms have been the subject of entail, and thus the law of entail has
                    supplied the key to more than one political situation. Such was the great
                    controversy “de vanitate haeredum regre-dientium,” whether according to the
                    doctrine of reversion or <hi rend="italic">regredient-erbeη,</hi> on the failure
                    of heirs male, and in the absence of any <hi rend="italic">pactum
                        confraternitatis</hi> taking the estate to another family, a fee-simple
                    estate remained in the last substitute, or whether the estate returned to the
                    heirs of the entail. This question arose in 1740 between Maria Theresa and the
                    elector of Bavaria; the former was victorious by force of arms against the
                    general opinion of lawyers. It was also discussed all over Europe in the
                    Hochsteden case. The crown of Spain was the type of the regular mayorazgo in
                    that country—the inalienable estates descending to the eldest and nearest heir
                    by blood (natu major), with right of representation and without preference of
                    males. Again, the relation between the crown and the entailed estates of
                    subjects has produced a number of elaborate rules with respect to the <hi
                        rend="italic">justoe causoe</hi> of interference by the state, and has thus
                    profoundly influenced the history of Europe. An Italian majoratus, for instance,
                    might include such subjects as ju3 honorificum, patronatus, commenda militaris,
                    feudum habens administrationem: from all these monks were by the common law
                    excluded; and all of them were forfeited to the fisc, either absolutely or for a
                    time, by the blasphemy, heresy, or treason of the heir in possession. The
                    entail, therefore, has always been much more than a family settlement or a
                    system of land tenure. In modern Europe there have not been many forms of
                    hereditary aristocracy without some form of entail. But it by no means follows
                    that the influence of perpetuities upon the aristocracy has been beneficial. The
                    introduction of <hi rend="italic">post obit</hi> bonds, and the law of England
                    relating to the protection of infants against unconscionable bargains, suggest
                    some reflections of a different kind. It will appear in this article that public
                    opinion has generally condemned entails, and that they are being rapidly
                    abolished throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>The speeches of Isaeus and Demosthenes show that in</p>
                <p>Greece many difficult questions had risen with regard to the power of a testator
                    to substitute one heir after another; but the earliest definite legal forms of
                    entail were those which appeared under the later Roman law relating to <hi
                        rend="italic">fidei commissa,</hi> or trusts. The fidei commissum was
                    originally a trust conveyance introduced for the purpose of evading such
                    disabilities as the lex Voconia imposed on women to take directly under a will.
                    The trustee, or <hi rend="italic">fiduciarius,</hi> was after the time of
                    Augustus liable in a personal action at the instance of the beneficiary, or <hi
                        rend="italic">hoeres</hi><hi rend="italic">fiduciamus.</hi> This form,
                    however, was soon converted into a long nomination or substitution of heirs, to
                    which clauses prohibiting alienation were added. The most common clauses were
                    such as “ne eum fundum vendatis,” “ne ex nomine familiae alienaretur.” One
                    well-known form also prohibited mortgages, and emphatically declared that the
                    settled estates should remain “firmas meis filiis et nepotibus <hi rend="italic"
                        >per</hi><hi rend="italic">universum</hi><hi rend="italic">ternpusf</hi> and
                    that all contrary deeds should be void and null. On this deed Scaevola expressed
                    the opinion that a security over the rents was not a contravention.<note

                    arose, not from his own act, but from the reserved estate of superiority and the
                    tenor of his charter in the lands. The feudal law also favoured male heirs, and
                    required that one heir only should succeed.</p>
                <p>It appears from the laws of Alfred (c. 37), that entails were known before the
                    Norman feudal law had been domesticated in England. “Si quis terram

                    prohibitum sit, qui eam ab initio acquisivit, ut ita facere nequeat.” These
                    grants which could not be alienated from the linea&lt;re of the first purchaser
                    were also known as <pb break="no"

                    because if the donee had no heirs of his body the estate reverted to the donor.
                    This right of reversion being constantly evaded by a sale and repurchase on the
                    birth of issue, the famous Statute of Westminster the Second, <hi rend="italic"

                    13 Edw. I. c. 1, was passed, which provided that the will of the donor should be
                    observed, and that no alienation by the donee should prevent the operation of
                    the condition. Thus was created the fee-tail, or <hi rend="italic">feudum
                        talliatum,</hi> of English law—a strict and practically perpetual entail.
                    The power of alienation was reintroduced by the judges in Taltarum’s case (Year
                    Book, 12 Edw. IV. 19) by means of a fictitious suit or recovery which had
                    originally been devised by the regular clergy for evading the statutes of
                    mortmain. A full account of the mysteries of praecipe and vouching, and of
                    another fictitious process of fine (finalis concordia) and proclamation, will be
                    found in Blackstone, ii. 7, and Mr Knowler’s argument in Taylor and Horde, 1
                    Burr. 60. These forms were abolished by an Act passed in 1833; and now every
                    tenant in tail, at least while there is a possibility of issue, may bar even his
                    issue by executing a deed and enrolling it in the Court of Chancery, but not by
                    will. This right is available to creditors. The erroneous notion of <hi
                        rend="italic">heir land,</hi> however,—of something which must perpetually
                    descend from father to son,—still lingers in some country districts of England.
                    By the common form of marriage settlement, the eldest son and the other sons of
                    the marriage are made tenants in tail. Where the parent or some other person
                    enjoys a life interest under the settlement, he is called the protector of the
                    settlement, and his consent is required to the barring of the entail by the
                    first tenant in tail. Thus, except in the case of estates tail granted by the
                    crown as a reward for public services (see 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 20), land in
                    England cannot now be tied up for a longer period than the livee of persons in
                    existence and twenty-one years thereafter. The rigid law of forfeiture which was
                    applied in the time of Henry VIII. to estates tail was repealed by the Act 33
                    and 34 Vict. c. 23, which provides that no conviction of treason or felony or
                    verdict of <hi rend="italic">felo de se</hi> shall cause any attainder or
                    corruption of blood or any forfeiture or escheat.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, where for several centuries feus remained inalienable beyond
                    one-half of their extent, where the feudal aristocracy often violently resisted
                    the approach of creditors or apprisers, and where the dawning of commerce wa3
                    very late, statutory authority was not given to entails until the year
                        1685.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>^^Dalrymple’s

                                Property,</hi></p></note> As Sir George Mackenzie said in one of his
                    pleadings, “the honour of the country standeth more by ancient families than by
                    merchants.” The word entail, indeed, is often used before the 15th century, but
                    generally in the sense of a simple destination alterable by every heir in
                    possession. Thus Sir James Balfour informs us that “infefment of tailzie” is
                    considered lawful and not prejudicial to the king’s soul and conscience, and
                    explains that the entail might at any time be broken by resignation in favour of
                    heirs whomsoever. The earliest prohibition <hi rend="italic">de non</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">alienando</hi> occurs in 1489. After this it was attempted to
                    protect the rights of substitute heirs by the diligences of inhibition and
                    interdiction; and at last, in the early part of the 17th century, Sir Thomas
                    Hope, who revised the Calderwood entail, introduced the well-known irritant and
                    resolutive clauses, declaring void deeds in contravention of the entail and the
                    right of the contravening heir. Cromwell, with his usual sagacity, appointed a
                    committee to consider the legal destruction of entails; but in the celebrated
                    Stormonth case in 1662, one of the clauses just mentioned was held to be valid
                    at com mon law against creditors, who, however, had got notice of it from the
                    title-deeds. Much doubt was felt about the soundness of this decision. The first
                    Roxburgh entail had been addressed to the sovereign, as if to invoke special
                    protection. The aristocracy were alarmed by the forfeitures for treason which
                    took place under Lauderdale’s administration; and accordingly the statute of
                    1685 was passed, which until · 1848 remained the <hi rend="italic"
                        >foundation</hi> of the Scotch law of entail. It adopts the style suggested
                    by Hope (a prohibition of sales, mortgages, and alterations of succession, with
                    irritant and resolutive clauses), and provides that if the deed of entail be
                    recorded in the register of tailzies, and if notice of the conditions be also
                    given in the titles of the estate, the entail is to have perpetual validity. The
                    heir in possession remained nominally proprietor, but his powers of management
                    were in reality not much more extensive than those of a liferenter. The statute
                    applied to almost everything in the nature of a heritable subject. Jedburgh
                    cross, for instance, was entailed; so was the office of heritable usher; even
                    the smallest properties <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> a lodging in Edinburgh,
                        <hi rend="italic">pars tenementi</hi> in Forfar, a single field in the
                    Haughs of Clyde) were sometimes tied up. But it did not apply to the entails of
                    money and household furniture, which had not been uncommon in earlier times. It
                    has been well described as a “padlock on the plough;” and the security from
                    forfeiture (except of the life-interest of the traitor) which the Scotch Estates
                    fancied they had secured by the Act 1690 c. 33 was taken away by the Act 1708,
                    c. 21, which attempted to assimilate the laws relating to treason in the two
                    countries. The feudal maxim “tantum facit quis delinquendo quantum alienando”
                    may have made rebellion more stubborn; but it is impossible not to agree with
                    the Scotch statute, that “it is just that every man suffer for his own fault,
                    and not the innocent with or for the guilty.” The English law of forfeiture, on
                    the other hand, proceeds on the Ciceronian principle “ut caritas liberorum
                    amiciores parentes reipublicae redderet” <hi rend="italic">(Ad</hi><hi

                    English entail were those of remainder-men; but as a Scotch entail has no
                    remainder-men, the forfeiture of Scotch estates was for a time complete. The
                    judges and the commissioners of forfeited estates took very different and very
                    warm views of the matter. After the first Jacobite rebellion, however, a
                    compromise was effected in the case of Gordon of Park, according to which only
                    the right of the traitor’s issue was taken away. Meanwhile the entail system was
                    found to weigh heavily on agriculture; the amount of litigation to assert or to
                    control the rights of the proprietors was excessive; the judges, chiefly members
                    of the aristocratic class, at first benignant towards perpetuities, had begun to
                    apply those strict tests of language an distinguished from intention which have
                    since furnished some of the most ludicrous and not the most creditable efforts
                    of judicial interpretation; and at last, through the efforts of the Faculty of
                    Advocates led by Mr Lockhart, the Montgomery Act (10 Geo. III. c. 51) was
                    passed, which gave some relief to heirs in possession in such matters as
                    building and improving leases, expenditure on permanent improvements, and
                    exchanges. It vjas followed after a long interval by the Aberdeen Act (5 Geo.
                    IV. c. 87), which conferred powers of charging provisions to a limited amount
                    for husbands, wives, and children; and after a select committee of the Commons
                    had reported on the subject of Scotch entail (Par. Pap. vii. 1828), by the
                    Rosebery Act (6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 42, amended by 1 and 2 Vict. c. 70, and 4 and
                    5 Vict. c. 24), which enlarged <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0472-0453"/> the powers of excambion, or exchange. The
                    suggestion made in 1827 to throw entailed estates into judicial management by an
                    action of cognition and sale was fortunately abandoned. In 1840 an Act (3 and 4
                    Vict. c. 48) permitted the granting of sites for churches, schools, manses, and
                    teachers’ houses. At last, an accomplished lawyer, Lord Rutherfurd, framed and
                    passed the comprehensive Act, 11 and 12 Vict. c. 36, which still bears his name,
                    and which has abolished perpetuities in Scotland and introduced a system of
                    greater freedom than that of strict settlement in England. This Act not only
                    increases the power of charging entailed estates with improvement debts and
                    provisions, of feuing, and of sale to pay off debt, but it introduces a right to
                    disentail to be exercised for some time after the passing of the Act with
                    certain consents, but which practically gives an estate in fee-simple to every
                    entailed proprietor born after 1848. This Act, which also applies for the first
                    time the principle of the Thellusson Act to land in Scotland, has been usefully
                    enlarged by the following Acts—16 and 17 Vict. c. 94, 31 and 32 Vict. c. 84, and
                    38 and 39 Vict. c. 61,—the last of which contains a liberal definition of
                    permanent improvements. In 1847 it was estimated that one-half of the land in
                    Scotland was under entail; in 1827 the proportion was stated at one-third, the
                    number of separate entails being about 1600. Since 1848, 616 deeds of entail,
                    including reentails, 435 instruments of disentail, and 105 deeds of excambion

                <p>From a very early time the Roman law of entail, or “substitution graduelle,” was
                    received in France. The very phrase of the digest, “ne de nomine exiret,” was in
                    common use. <hi rend="italic">Insinuation,</hi> or recording in the books of a

                    charge the estate with a provision for his wife. In 1747 the Chancellor
                    D’Aguesseau, after collecting the opinions of all the local parliaments on the
                    subject, passed the Ordonnances of Orléans and Moulin, which prohibited
                    perpetual substitutions, but permitted them for two degrees (see <hi

                    Merlin, xiii. 67). Substitutions of every kind were abolished by section 896 of
                    the Code Napoléon, but at the same time, as was explained above, the emperor
                    attempted to revive the system of majorats, or entails of subsidized dignities.
                    He says his object is “non seulement d’entourer notre trône de la splendeur qui
                    convient à sa dignité, mais encore, de nourrir au coeur de nos sujets une
                    louable émulation, en perpétuant d’illustres souvenirs, et en conservant aux
                    âges futurs l’image toujours présente des récompenses qui sous un gouvernement
                    juste suivent les grands services rendus à l’etat” (Imperial Decree of 1st March
                    1808). All the dukes, barons, counts, and chevaliers, and the others who
                    obtained majorats, had to make the following oath :—“Je jure d’être fidèle à
                    l’empereur et à sa dynastie, d’obéir aux constitutions, lois, et règlemens de
                    l’empire, de servir sa majesté en bon, loyal, et fidèle sujet, et d’élever mes
                    enfans dans les memes sentimens de fidélité et d’obéissance, et de marcher à la
                    défense de la patrie toutes les fois que le territoire sera menacé, ou que sa
                    majesté irait à l’armée.”</p>
                <p>The estates of these majorats were subject to inspection by <hi rend="italic"
                        >agents conservateurs.</hi> The mansion-house was to be at least 2 per cent,
                    of the value of the estate. The later French laws relating to substitutions are
                    those of 12th May 1835, prohibiting all future substitutions, and 7th May
                    1849.</p>
                <p>It has already been pointed out that the Spanish crown was a majorat, subject to
                    the quaint condition, <hi rend="italic">seyendo home para ello,</hi> that the
                    heir should be a fit and proper person. The inalienability of the domain of the
                    sovereign (except to provide an apanage for the younger members of the reigning
                    family) and of the greater peers was almost part of the common law of Europe
                    (Sande, <hi rend="italic">De proh. rer. alien.)</hi> But in Spain there was än
                    unusual complexity of entails,—regular and irregular, substantial and habitual,
                    &lt;tc., varying with the elements of linea, gradus, sexus, and aetas. The <hi

                    creation of a majorat. The principle of succession was that at every devolution
                    the nearest heir to the original testator should be selected (proximitas
                    gravantis non gravati).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>The French constitution of Bayonne (1808) abolished majorats
                            producing less than 5000 or more than 20,000 piastres.</p></note> In
                    Italy a very similar state of matters existed; the Roman phrase “quia volo ut
                    bona mea remaneant in familia mea” seem to have become words of style.</p>
                <p>In Portugal the <hi rend="italic">prasos de vita,</hi> or inalienable right of

                    1863.</p>
                <p>Denmark still retains much more perfect entails. There the <hi rend="italic"

                        gods,</hi> or portion occupied by small farmers, is frequently entailed
                    either as (1) the sàmAwsô, a perpetual entail of both heritable and movable
                    estate, which the crown sometimes graciously allows to be converted into money
                    trusts, or (2) the 32 baronial fiefs all created since the establishment of
                    absolute government in 1660, and which on failure of heirs revert to the
                        crown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is also
                            the <hi rend="italic">Arve</hi><hi rend="italic">foeste,</hi> or
                            entailed lease to the tenant and his heirs for ever, escheating to the
                            owner on failure of heirs, and without· powers of sale or
                        mortgage.</p></note> Ever since the teaching of the economist Pontoppidan,
                    followed up by the practical efforts of Bernstorff and Struensee, and in the
                    present century by the agitation of the <hi rend="italic">Bondevenner,</hi> or
                    Radical Left of the Rigsdag, there has been a tendency to bring land more
                    completely into commerce. The constitution of 1849, indeed, prohibits the
                    creation of new entails. By Bishop Mourad’s bill of 1861, drawn by the jurist
                    Larsen, the powers of selling the entailed bonder gaarde were extended much
                    beyond the principles of <hi rend="italic">foestetvang,</hi> or obligation to
                    lease for two lives. Count Frijs and the landowners’ party then began the
                    voluntary conversion of the tene-mented farms into freeholds; and in 1869 Hansen
                    carried his expropriation bill, which prohibits new estates for life, and
                    provides a machinery for compensation at the expiry of existing interests. In
                    Sweden, although primogeniture and eyen favour to male issue is unknown, there
                    are still entails, although no new ones can be created.</p>

                <p>The old hereditary male fiefs, sanjak or beglik, <hi rend="italic">ziainet</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">timars,</hi> originally granted by the Ottoman rulers,
                    have now entirely disappeared. These grants were indivisible and inviolable, and
                    formed a species of Government entail. The possessor of the beglik was in the
                    Turkish-speaking provinces called dere-beg, lord of the valley; in the Arab
                    districts <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Syria and Irak) he was called ameer, or
                    governor. The <hi rend="italic">eraziye mirige,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >imlak</hi> (crown) lands, held from the crown, still require public
                    authority for most acts of full ownership. (See the law of 7th Ramazan 1274, or
                    19th April 1857, which, slightly modified, forms at present the code of
                    land-title in Turkey in Europe.) It is a fundamental principle of Mahometan law
                    that all land belongs to the sultan as the gift of God, and is therefore to be
                    used justly.</p>
                <p>The land-legislation of Prussia during the present century is so often quoted
                    that this sketch would not be complete without some reference to its provisions
                    on the subject of entails. By the 5th clause of the edict of October 9, 1807,
                    the practice of settling estates by hereditary leases (afterwards abolished) was
                    continued · while the 9th clause provided that feudal entails and <hi
                        rend="italic">fidei commissa</hi> might be unsettled by family agreement.
                    The Prussian <hi rend="italic">fidei commissum</hi> may be constituted in every
                    object of property yielding annual returns without waste of substance; and so an
                    entail of certain movables is competent. The Prussian tenant for life can let on
                    lease, and charge the land with annuities for his daughters, and can
                    gratuitously dispose of his life-interest. The Hessian law compels him to charge
                    the fee with provisions to his younger sons. The sale of useless land has always
                    been permitted, but otherwise a public Act of expropriation must be got, or a
                    decision of the whole family council. Two next heirs in remainder may, however,
                    by their consent give effect to an exchange. The charges to which a <hi
                        rend="italic">fidei commissum</hi> is subject are the debts of the founder,
                    expenditure by the tenant for the abolition of real charges, for embankment
                    dues, flood-rates, rebuilding, and for bringing worn-out land again into
                    cultivation. The succession is usually limited to male persons; and monks and
                    dishonoured persons are specially excluded. In the Rhine Provinces and many
                    parts of North Germany, <hi rend="italic">fidei commissa</hi> were abolished on
                    the introduction of French law without compensation to the heirs in remainder.
                    They were subsequently re-established, but the 38th section of the Land Rights
                    of the German people (1848) provides— <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Fidei commissa</hi> are to be abolished. The form and conditions of such
                    abolition are to be determined by the legislation of each state.” Distinct from
                        <hi rend="italic">fidei commissa</hi> there are in Germany many ancient
                    customary entails, not usually restricted to male heirs, and terminable by
                    agreement of the occupant with the next heir. There was also power to sell in
                    circumstances of necessity subject to preemption by the next heir. Many of these
                    estates rest on family “bye-laws.”</p>
