                    Wellington, which he retained all through his Indian career, Lord Ellenborough
                    was appointed lord privy seal, and then president of the Board of Control, in
                    the year 1828. In 1834 and in 1841 for a few weeks he again held the latter
                    office, the duties of which at once made him familiar with the affairs of India,
                    and gave him control over the court of directors. Sir Robert Peel appointed him
                    governor-general with the Queen’s approval. He discharged the duties of the high
                    position from the 28th February 1842 to the 15th June 1844, when the directors
                    exercised their power of recalling him. He finally left Calcutta on the 1st
                    August 1844. His Indian administration of two and a half years, or half the
                    usual term of service, was from first to last a subject of hostile criticism.
                    His own letters sent monthly to the Queen, and his correspondence with the duke
                    of Wellington, published in 1874 after his death, enable us to form an
                    intelligent and impartial judgment of his meteorlike career. The events in
                    dispute are his policy towards Afghanistan and the army and captives there, his
                    conquest of Sind, and his campaign in Gwalior. He was fortunate in having as his
                    private secretary Captain (afterwards Sir Henry) Durand, the accomplished
                    engineer officer and statesman, who died in 1871 when lieutenant-governor of the
                    Punjab. Although he was absorbed in military and foreign politics, his
                    administration was fertile in peaceful reforms, due to his colleague, Mr
                    Wilberforce Bird, who purged the police, put down state lotteries, and
                    prohibited slavery, with Ellenborough’s hearty support.</p>
                <p>The impartial study of Lord Ellenborough’s correspond ence in the light of the
                    records and criticisms of the times must confirm the contemporary verdict
                    against him on the questions of Afghanistan and Sind, and may lead us to approve
                    of his action in Gwalior. All through his brief Indian career, moreover, his
                    severest critics must admire the splendour of his intellect (which put him in
                    the first rank of orators in the House of Lords down almost to the year of his
                    death), the purity of his public patronage, and the energy of his devotion to
                    the service of his country. The same judgment which marked his later criticism
                    of others was wanting when he held the almost irresponsible power of
                    governor-general, to make his rule as useful as it was remarkable. If men like
                    Durand and Wilberforce Bird helped him by the Dossession of the official and
                    ethical <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0156-0147"/> virtues which he lacked, we must not forget that
                    Sir Charles Napier led his Government and himself still farther to that extreme
                    of rashness and impulse which was his baue. And against his only too apparent
                    contempt or indifference for all things not military we must set the
                    statesmanlike views expressed to the Queen and the duke of Wellington on the
                    critical position of Great Britain in the East, and the necessity for
                    strengthening it by military reforms. He repeated what the greater
                    governor-general Wellesley had urged, but in vain, on the East India Gom-pany at
                    the beginning of the century, and Dalhousie again in 1854-56. The penalty came
                    in the mutiny campaigns of 1857, as it had been foreshadowed in the Cabul
                    disasters of 1838-42.</p>
                <p>It was to retrieve these disasters that Lord Ellenborough was sent out. If he had
                    a difficult task, he found the tide of fortune just on the turn. In his
                    proclamation of the 15th March 1842, as in his memorandum for the Queen dated
                    the 18th, he stated with characteristic clearness and eloquence the duty of
                    first inflicting some signal and decisive blow on the Afghans, and then leaving
                    them to govern themselves under the sovereign of their own choice. Unhappily,
                    when he left his council for Upper India, and learned the trifling failure of
                    General England, he instructed Pollock and Nott, who were advancing triumphantly
                    with their avenging columns to rescue the captives, to fall back. Not a word was
                    said of the nine ladies, twenty officers, and fourteen children who were being
                    pursued from prison to prison in the hills, in spite of the heroic efforts of
                    one of their number, MajorGeneral Colin Mackenzie, who still survives, to secure
                    their honourable release. Even such an object as “that of avenging our losses
                    and re-establishing our military character in all its original brilliancy” w as
                    declared not now to be justifiable. How this charge was received by the
                    “illustrious” troops of Jellalabad and the advancing conquerors of Ghuznee and
                    Akbar Khan, the Life of Pollock and the journals of the day testify. The shout
                    of indignation was too much even for Ellenborough, but he only added to it
                    derision when he shirked responsibility by directing Pollock and Nott to retire
                    by the roundabout way of Cabul if they could! The army proved true to the
                    governor-general’s earlier proclamation rather than to his later fears; the
                    hostages were rescued, the scene of Sir Alexander Burnes’s murder in the heart
                    of Cabul was burned down. Dost Mahomed was quietly dismissed from a prison in
                    Calcutta to the throne in the Bala Hissar, and Ellenborough presided over the
                    painting of the elephants for an unprecedented military spectacle at Ferozepore,
                    on the south bank of the Sutlej. But this was not the only piece of theatrical
                    display which capped with ridicule the horrors and the follies of these four
                    years in Afghanistan. When Sultan Mahmoud, in 1024, sacked the Hindu temple of
                    Somnauth on the north-west coast of India, he carried off, with the treasures,
                    the richly-studded sandal-wood gates of the fane, and set them up in his capital
                    of Ghuznee. The Mahometan puppet of the English, Shah Shooja, had been asked,
                    when ruler of Afghanistan, to restore them to India; and what he had failed to
                    do the Christian ruler of opposing Mahometans and Hindus resolved to effect in
                    the most solemn and public manner. In vain had Major (now Sir Henry) Rawlinson
                    proved that they were only reproductions of the original gates, to which the
                    Ghuznee Moulvies clung merely as a source of offerings from the faithful who
                    visited the old conqueror’s tomb. In vain did the Hindu sepoys show the most
                    chilling indifference to the belauded restoration. Ellenborough could not resist
                    the temptation to copy Napoleon’s magniloquent proclamation under the Pyramids.
                    The desecrated or fraudulent folding doors—more “glorious trophy of successful
                    warfare” than the heroic hostage3 whose names Lady Sale’s Journals, Mackenzie’s
                    martyrlike courage, and ∖ incent Eyre’s book have made imperishable—were
                    conveyed on a triumphal car to the fort of Agra, and there they lie among the
                    old muskets to this day. That Somnauth proclamation was the first step towards
                    its author’s recall, but it had the one good result of calling forth Lord
                    Macaulay’s most brilliant philippic in the House of Commons on the 9th March
                    1843.</p>
                <p>Hardly had Ellenborough issued his medal with tho legend « Pax Asiae Restituta”
                    when he was at war with the Ameers of Sind. The tributary Ameers had on the
                    whole been faithful, for Major (afterwards Sir James) Outram controlled them.
                    But he had reported the opposition of a few, and Ellenborough ordered an
                    inquiry. His instructions were admirable, in equity as well as energy, and if
                    Outram had been left to carry them out all would have been welL But the duty was
                    intrusted to Sir Charles Napier, with full political as well as military powers.
                    And to add to the evil, Meer Ali Morad intrigued with both sides so effectually
                    that he betrayed the Ameers on the one hand, while he deluded Sir Charles Napier
                    to their destruction on the other. Ellenborough was led on till events were
                    beyond his control, and his own just and merciful instructions were forgotten.
                    Sir Charles Napier made more than one confession like this: “We have no right to
                    seize Sind, yet we shall do so, and a very advantageous, useful, and humane
                    piece of rascality it will be.” The battles of Meanee and Dubba, or Hydrabad,
                    followed; and the Indus became a British river from Kurrachee to Mooltan, soon
                    to be “red” to its source in the glaciers that fringe Kashgaria. Yet, writing to
                    the Queen on the 27th June 1843, he formally pronounced his policy “at once just
                    and expedient,” after remarking that “it would not be ungrateful to him to be
                    relieved from a government which he has conduβted amidst uninterrupted
                    misrepresentations and calumny.”</p>
                <p>Sind had hardly been disposed of when troubles arose on both sides of the
                    governor-general, who was then at Agra. On the north the disordered kingdom of
                    the Sikhs was threatening the frontier. In Gwalior to the south, the feudatory
                    Mahratta state, there were a strong and large mutinous army, a Ranee only twelve
                    years of age, an adopted chief of eight, and factions in the council of
                    ministers. Instead of citing the authority of the forgotten treaty of
                    Burhanpore, the governor-general might have pled the public security—he did talk
                    of “humanity ”—aβ a reason for demanding that the state should be intrusted to
                    one regent. Our nominee proved incompetent, his rival showed himself a traitor;
                    Tara Ranee was herself little more than a child; and the Praetorians controlled
                    the whole. Ellenborough reviewed the danger in the unanswerable minute of 1st
                    November 1845, aud told Sir Hugh Gough to advance. Further treachery and
                    military licence rendered the battles of Maharaj pore and Punniar, fought on the
                    same day, inevitable though they were, a surprise to the combatants. The
                    governor-general, on his charger, exposed himself with characteristic rashness
                    in the thick of the fight, and when it was over he regaled the wounded with
                    oranges and gifts. The treaty that followed was as merciful as it was wise. The
                    pacification of Gwalior also had its effect beyond the Sutlej, where anarchy was
                    restrained for yet another year, and the work of civilization was left to
                    Ellenborough’s two successors. The idol of the army, he did not leave India
                    without a military banquet, which the duke of Wellington, in an official letter
                    to the earl of Ripon, full of curious reminiscences, refused to condemn. Sir
                    Robert Peel’s Government, which had sent him out, made him a viscount and earl,
                    and put him at the head of the Admiralty. When again in his old office, as
                    almost the last president of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0157-0148"/> Board of Control under Lord Derby, in 1858, he
                    fell into his old impetuosity, by censuring Canning for the confiscation of
                    Oudh, which would have been communistic if it had not proved nominal, and, so
                    far, justified by political reasons. To save the Cabinet he resigned. But for
                    this act of rashness, he might have enjoyed the task of carrying into effect the
                    home constitution for the Government of India which he sketched in his evidence
                    before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Indian Territories on the
                    8th June 1852. Paying off his old score against the East India Company, he then
                    advocated the abolition of the Court of Directors as a governing body, the
                    opening of the Civil Service to the army, the transference of the government to
                    the Crown, and the appointment of a council to advise the minister who should
                    take the place of the president of the Board of Control. These suggestions of
                    1852 were carried out by his successor Lord Staιdey, now earl of Derby, in 1858,
                    so closely even in details, that Lord Ellenborough must be pronounced the
                    author, for good or evil, of the present home constitution of the Government of
                    India. After his farewell to official life, the dash and the brilliancy of the
                    earl of Ellenborough found a legitimate expression in his vigilant criticisms of
                    Indian, and his broad and eloquent expositions of European, politics in the
                    House of Lords. To the nation he bequeathed, as his only defence, the
                    publication of his letters already referred to, “without introduction or
                    comment.” He died at his seat, Southam House, near Cheltenham, on the 22d
                    December 1871, at the age of eighty-one. The barony reverted to his nephew, the
                    earldom becoming extinct. One of the most able, and certainly the most erratic,
                    of all the governorsgeneral, he survived six of his successors. In many features
                    of his character he resembled his distinguished father.</p>
                <p>For the vexed facts of Ellenborough s career, and his always forcibly expressed
                    opinions, see History of the Indian Administration (Bentley, 1874), edited by

                    writings throw further light on the treatment of the captives. The numerous
                    books by and against Sir Charles Napier, on the conquest of Sind, should be
                    consulted. (G. SM.)</p>
