                <p><label type="entry">EMBEZZLEMENT</label>, in English law, is a peculiar form of
                    theft which is distinguished from the ordinary crime in two points :—(1) It is
                    committed by a person who is in the position of clerk or servant to the owner of
                    the property stolen; and (2) the property when stolen is in the possession of
                    such clerk or servant. The definition of embezzlement as a special form of theft
                    arose out of the difficulties caused by the legal doctrine that to constitute
                    larceny the property must be taken out of the possession of the owner. Servants
                    and others were thus able to steal with impunity goods intrusted to them by
                    their masters. The statute 21 Henry VIII. c. 7 was passed to meet this case; and
                    it enacted that it should be felony in servants to convert to their own use
                    caskets, jewels, money, goods, or chattels delivered to them by their masters.
                    “This Act,” says Sir J. F. Stephen (General View of the Criminal Law of
                    England), “assisted by certain subtleties according to which the possession of
                    the servant was taken under particular circumstances to be the possession of the
                    master, so that the servant by converting the goods to his own use took them out
                    of his own possession qua servant (which was his master’s possession) and put
                    them into his own possession qua thief (which was a felony), was considered
                    sufficient for practical purposes for more than 200 years.” In 1799, a clerk who
                    had converted to his own use a cheque paid across the counter to him by a
                    customer of his master was held to be not guilty of felony; and in the same year
                    the Act 39 Geo. III. c. 85 was passed, which, meeting the difficulty in such
                    cases, enacted that if any clerk or servant, or any person employed as clerk or
                    servant, should, by virtue of such employment, receive or take into his
                    possession any money, bonds, bills, &lt;kc., for or in the name or on account of
                    his employers, and should fraudulently embezzle the same, every such offender
                    should be deemed to have stolen the same. The same definition is substantially
                    repeated in a Consolidation Act passed in 1827 (7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 29).
                    Numberless difficulties of interpretation arose under these Acts, e.g., as to
                    the meaning of “clerk or servant,” as to the difference between theft and
                    embezzlement, &lt;fcc. The law now in force, or the Larceny Act, 24 and 25 Vict.
                    c. 96, defines the offence thus (section 68) :—“Whosoever, being a clerk or
                    servant, or being employed for the purpose or in the capacity of a clerk or
                    servant, shall fraudulently embezzle any chattel, money, or valuable security
                    which shall be delivered to or received or taken into possession by him for or
                    in the name or on the account of his master or employer, or any part thereof,
                    shall be deemed to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n169/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0169-0160"/> feloniously stolen the same from his master or
                    employer, although such chattel, money, or security was not received into the
                    possession of such master or employer otherwise than by the actual possession of
                    his clerk, servant, or other person so employed, and being convicted thereof
                    shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be kept in penal servitude
                    for any time not exceeding fourteen years, and not less than three (now five)
                    years.” To constitute the offence thus described three things must concur :—(1)
                    The offender must be a clerk or servant; (2) he must receive into his possession
                    some chattel on behalf of his master; and (3) he must fraudulently embezzle the
                    same. A clerk or servant has been defined to be a person bound either by an
                    express contract of service or by conduct implying such a contract to obey the
                    orders and submit to the control of his master in the transaction of the
                    business which it is his duty as such clerk or servant to transact. (Stephen’s
                    Digest of the Criminal Law, Art. 309.) The Larceny Act also describes similar
                    offences on the part of persons, not being clerks or servants, to which the name
                    embezzlement is not uncommonly applied, e.g., the fraudulent conversion by
                    bankers, merchants, brokers, attorneys, or other agents, of money or securities
                    or goods intrusted to them. This offence is a misdemeanour punishable by penal
                    servitude for any term not exceeding seven nor less than five years. So also
                    trustees fraudulently disposing of trust property, and directors of companies
                    fraudulently appropriating the company’s property or keeping fraudulent
                    accounts, or wilfully destroying books or publishing fraudulent statements, are
                    misdemeanants punishable in the same way.</p>
