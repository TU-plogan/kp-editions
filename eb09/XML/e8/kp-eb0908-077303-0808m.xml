                    university of his native town in 1820; and there, with Eichhorn as teacher, he
                    at once began to devote himself specially to the study of Hebrew and its
                    cognates. At the close of his academical career in 1823 he was appointed to a
                    mastership in the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0809-0774"/> gymnasium at Wolfenbüttel; but soon afterwards
                    (in the spring of 1824) he was, at the instance of Eichhorn, recalled to
                    Gottingen as repetent, or theological tutor, and in 1827 (the year of Eichhorn’s
                    death) he became professor <hi rend="italic">extraordinarius</hi> in philosophy,
                    and lecturer in Old Testament exegesis. In 1831 he was promoted to the position
                    of professor <hi rend="italic">ordinarius</hi> in philosophy; and in 1835 he
                    entered the faculty of theology, taking the chair of Oriental languages. Two
                    years later occurred the first important episode in his studious life, which
                    until then had been uninterrupted in its even tenor except by journeys in 1826,
                    1829, and 1836 to Berlin, Paris, and Italy, for the purpose of consulting rare
                    and important oriental manuscripts. In 1837, on the 18th November, along with
                    six of his colleagues (Dahlmann the historian, Weber the electrician, Gervinus
                    the critic, the brothers Grimm, and W. E. Albrecht) he signed a formal protest
                    against the arbitrary proceeding of King Ernst August (duke of Cumberland) in
                    abolishing the liberal constitution of 1833, which had been granted to the
                    Hanoverians by his predecessor William IV. This bold action of the seven
                    professors made them very popular and famous in the country; but it led to their
                    speedy expulsion from the university (14th December). Early in 1838 Ewald
                    received a call to Tübingen, and there for upwards of ten years he held a chair
                    as professor <hi rend="italic">ordinarius,</hi> first in philosophy and
                    afterwards, from 1841, in theology. To this period belong some of his most
                    important works, and also the commencement of his bitter feud with F. C. Baur
                    and the Tübingen critical school. In 1848, “the great shipwreck-year in
                    Germany,” as he has called it, he was invited back to Göttingen on honourable
                    terms,—the liberal constitution having been restored. He gladly accepted the
                    invitation, for though well treated in Würtemberg (he had been ennobled by the
                    king in 1841), he had never learned to regard his sojourn there as anything else
                    than a period of exile. In 1862-63 he took an active part in a movement for
                    reform within the Hanoverian church, and he was a member of the synod which
                    passed the new constitution. He had an important share also in the formation of
                    the Protestantenverein, or Protestant association, in September 1863. But the.
                    chief crisis in his life arose out of the great political events of 1866. His
                    loyalty to King George (son of Ernst August) would not permit him to take the
                    oath of allegiance to the victorious king of Prussia, and in consequence of his
                    refusal to da so he was ultimately placed on the retired list, though with the
                    full amount of his salary as pension. Perhaps even this degree of severity might
                    have been held by the Prussian authorities to be unnecessary, had Ewald been
                    less exasperating in his language. The violent tone of some of his printed
                    manifestoes about this time, especially of his <hi rend="italic">Lob des
                    Königs</hi><hi rend="italic">u.</hi><hi rend="italic">des Volkes,</hi> led to
                    his being deprived of the venia <hi rend="italic">legendi</hi> (1868), and also
                    to a criminal process, which, however, resulted in his acquittal (May 1869).
                    Then, and on two subsequent occasions, he was returned by the city of Hanover as
                    a member of the North German and German parliaments. In June 1874 he was found
                    guilty of a libel on Prince Bismarck, whom he had compared to Frederick II. and
                    Napoleon III. —to the former in “his unrighteous war with Austria and his
                    ruination of religion and morality,” to the latter in his way of “picking out
                    the best time possible for robbery and plunder.” For this offence he was
                    sentenced to undergo three weeks’ imprisonment. He died in his 72d year, of
                    heart-disease, May 4, 1875.</p>
                <p>From the above brief sketch it will be seen that, even apart from his
                    contributions to philological and biblical βcience, Ewald was no common man. In
                    the whole course of his public life he displayed in a very high degree many
                    noble characteristics,—perfect simolicity and sincerity, intensest moral
                    earnestness, sturdiest independence, absolute fearlessness. It would be
                    difficult to say whether the intellectual or the emotional side of his nature
                    was most highly developed. He loved with peculiar intensity, loved freedom and
                    truth in every domain, in politics as well as in science and in religion; and
                    just because he loved them with all his great might, he could not help hating
                    all that he believed to be opposed to them. It was impossible for him to be a
                    mere critic; no reader can understand Ewald’s position who allows himself to
                    forget that his whole being was possessed with a passionately devoted faith. It
                    was natural that such a man should be frequently engaged in controversy, and
                    equally natural that in these circumstances the “defects of his qualities”
                    should often become painfully apparent. It cannot be denied that in his manner
                    of speaking about his opponents he often overstepped the limits of charity and
                    even of justice. The peculiar character of his intellect, which was rather
                    intuitive than inductive, made him neither a very fair nor a very effective
                    controversialist. No one equalled him in the power of comprehending in a single
                    survey a vast circle of complicated facts, and almost instinctively divining
                    their scientific unity; but the results attained in this way presented
                    themselves to his mind with such intuitive conviction that he was impatient of
                    all objection, and little able to do justice to scholars of a different mental
                    habit. Yet in controversy he probably received injustice more often than he
                    inflicted it; even his extremest views have generally been found to contain much
                    that is true and valuable; and the great Arabist Fleischer is almost the only
                    scholar who gained a conspicuous victory over him on an unambiguous philological
                    issue. As a teacher he had a remarkable power of kindling enthusiasm; and he
                    sent out many distinguished pupils, among whom may be mentioned Hitzig Schrader,
                    Nöldeke, Diestel, and Dillmann. His disciples have not been all of one school,
                    any more than were those of Socrates; but many eminent moderns who are
                    apparently farthest removed from his influence are only developing some of the
                    fruitful ideas which in the exuberance of his wealth he was wont to fling out by
                    handfuls.</p>
                <p>Of no writings more truly than of his could it be said that they are the
                    reservoirs into which, without any waste, the entire energy of a life has been
                    stored. For more than half a century his pen was never idle; from 1823 onwards
                    hardly a year passed which was not marked by the appearance of some highly
                    important contribution to the sciences he loved. By the publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Hebrew Grammar</hi> he inaugurated a new era in biblical
                    philology. All subsequent works in that department have been avowedly based on
                    his. It has already been superseded in parts, especially in its accidence; but
                    the syntax still remains unexcelled for the sagacity with which dry rules are
                    made intelligible and interesting by continued reference to the fundamental laws
                    of language and thought. But even when his <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch</hi> shall
                    have become entirely antiquated, to him will always belong the honour of having
                    been, as Hitzig has called him, “the second founder of the science of Hebrew
                    language.” As an exegete and biblical critic no less than as a grammarian he has
                    left his abiding mark. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the publication
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Volkes</hi><hi rend="italic">Israel</hi>
                    was epoch-making in that branch of research, as much as was the work of Niebuhr
                    in relation to the history of Rome. In its final form, the result of thirty
                    years’ labour, it is a noble monument to the genius of its author. No one can
                    fail tobe struck with the profundity of insight and patience of research which
                    it displays. While in every line it bears the marks of Ewald’s intense
                    individuality, it is at the same time a highly characteristic product of the
                    age, and even decade, in which it first appeared. If it is obviously the outcome
                    of immense learning on the part of its author, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0810-0775"/> it is no less manifestly the result of the
                    speculations and researches of many laborious predecessors in all departments of
                    history, theology, and philosophy. Especially is it indebted to the so-called
                    “destructive” criticism. The Reformation had destroyed that mediaeval conception
                    of the Bible which took no account of literary history or doctrinal development
                    at all; and subsequent researches, especially since those of Astruc, had made it
                    abundantly clear that the conditions under which the Old Testament books had
                    come into being were much more complicated than had been at one time supposed.
                    Criticism, however, could not possibly rest satisfied with these purely negative
                    results. If for a time it seemed as if the sacred literature had been reduced to
                    a mere chaos of fragments, which men might well despair of ever being able to
                    reduce to harmony and order, the historical sense had been developing no less
                    remarkably than the spirit of criticism. Taught by some of the more modern
                    schools of philosophy, men had been learning to take larger, and therefore
                    juster, views of the principles that underlie all national histories and the
                    general history of the human race. It was impossible that such a phenomenon as
                    the Jewish people and their literature should be permanently set aside as wholly
                    incomprehensible. The world was only waiting for a bold and vigorous
                    constructive genius like that of Ewald to bring together the scattered
                    fragments, and construe them into an intelligible unity; to show, for example,
                    that, if the Psalter could no longer be regarded as the record of the spiritual
                    experience of the individual to whom it had been traditionally ascribed, it
                    became all the more precious when known to embody all the highest aspirations
                    and purest joys and noblest sorrows of many centuries of national life; and that
                    if the legislation of the Pentateuch was not indeed, as had once been supposed,
                    the work of a few quiet months, it gained in interest and instructiveness when
                    known to be the slow growth of many busy generations. Taking up the idea of a
                    divine education of the human race, which Lessing and Herder had made so
                    familiar to the modern mind, and firmly believing that to each of the leading
                    nations of antiquity a special task had been providentially assigned, Ewald felt
                    no difficulty about Israel’s place in universal history, or about the problem
                    which that primitive and highly endowed race had been called upon to solve. The
                    history of Israel, according to him, is simply the history of the manner in
                    which the one true religion really and truly came into the possession of
                    mankind. Other nations, indeed, had attempted the highest problems in religion;
                    but Israel alone had, in the providence of God, succeeded, for Israel alone had
                    been inspired. Such is the supreme meaning of that national history which began
                    with the exodus and culminated (at the same time virtually terminating) in the
                    appearing of Christ, the supremely perfect revelation or self-manifestation of
                    God. The historical interval that separated these two events is treated as
                    naturally dividing itself into three great periods, —those of Moses and the
                    theocracy, of David and the monarchy, of Ezra and the hagiocracy. The periods
                    are externally indicated by the successive names by which the chosen people were
                    called—Hebrews, Israelites, Jews. The events prior to the exodus are relegated
                    by Ewald to a preliminary chapter of primitive history; and the events of the
                    apostolic and post-apostolin age are treated as a kind of appendix. The entire
                    construction of the history is based, a3 has already been said, on a critical
                    examination and chronological arrangement of the available documents. So far as
                    the results of criticism are still uncertain with regard to the age and
                    authorship of any of these, Ewald’s conclusions must of course be regarded as
                    unsatisfactory; and it cannot be denied that later investigations have shown
                    that in many important points his firm faith that finality had been attained was
                    illusory. These admissions, however, hardly affect the permanent value of his
                    work. It will continue to be a storehouse of learning for all subsequent
                    investigators in the field of sacred history, and it will be increasingly
                    recognized as a work of rare genius. It would be impossible to praise too highly
                    the conscientiousness with which the minutest features of the history have been
                    carefully scanned; the marvellous power of combination which, at even the most
                    unlikely points, can draw the most graphic illustrations from contemporary
                    prophets and poets; the vividness with which, not only the politics, but also
                    the religion, the arts, the literature, the domestic life, of each sucesssive
                    period are depicted; the loving enthusiasm of the student who believes that
                    those only are the enemies of the Bible who fail to investigate it, or who fail
                    to investigate it thoroughly.</p>
                <p>In his work on biblical theology, he can hardly be said to have been so
                    successful as in some of his earlier efforts. Though a suggestive and therefore
                    a useful book, its conclusions are vitiated in many cases by a glaring departure
                    from the inductive method, the interpretations being often speculative rather
                    than biblical, and unduly dominated by a preconceived metaρhysico-religious
                    system of the universe.</p>
