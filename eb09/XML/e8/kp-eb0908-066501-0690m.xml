                    his father, he was sent to the university of Basel, where geometry soon became
                    his favourite study. His genius for analytical science gained for him a high
                    place in the esteem of John Bernoulli, who was at that time one of the first
                    mathematicians in Europe, as well as of his sons Daniel and Nicholas Bernoulli.
                    Having taken his degree as master of arts in 1723, Euler afterwards applied
                    himself, at his father’s desire, to the study of theology and the Oriental
                    languages with the view of entering the church, but, with his father’s consent,
                    he soon returned to geometry as his principal pursuit. At the same time, by the
                    advice of the younger Bernoullis, who had removed to St Petersburg in 1725, he
                    applied himself to the study of physiology, to which he made a happy application
                    of his mathematical knowledge; and he also attended the medical lectures of the
                    most eminent professors of Basel. While he was keenly engaged in physiological
                    researches, he composed a dissertation on the nature and propagation of sound,
                    and an answer to a prize-question concerning the masting of ships, to which the
                    French Academy of Sciences adjudged the second rank in the year 1727.</p>
                <p>In 1727, on the invitation of Catherine I., Euler took up his residence in St
                    Petersburg, and was made an associate of the Academy of Sciences. In 1730 he
                    became professor of physics, and in 1733 he succeeded his friend Daniel
                    Bernoulli in the chair of mathematics. At the commencement of his new career he
                    enriched the academical collec tion with many memoirs, which excited a noble
                    emulation between him and the Bernoullis, though this did not in any way affect
                    their friendship. It was at this time that he carried the integral calculus to a
                    higher degree of perfection, invented the calculation of sines, reduced
                    analytical operations to a greater simplicity, and threw new light on nearly all
                    parts of abstract or pure mathematics. In 1735 a problem proposed by the
                    academy, for the solution of which several eminent mathematicians had demanded
                    the space of some months, was solved by Euler in three days, but the effort
                    threw him into a fever which endangered his life and deprived him of the use of
                    his right eye. The Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1738 adjudged the prize to
                    his memoir on the nature and properties of fire, and in 1740 his treatise on the
                    tides shared the prize with those of Colin Maclaurin and Daniel Bernoulli,—a
                    higher honour than if he had carried it away from inferior rivals.</p>
                <p>In 1741 Euler accepted the invitation of Frederick the Great to Berlin, where he
                    was made a member of the Academy of Sciences and professor of mathematics. He
                    enriched the last volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mélanges</hi> or Miscellanies
                    of Berlin with five memoirs, and these were followed, with an astonishing
                    rapidity, by a great number of important researches, which are scattered
                    throughout the annual memoirs of the Prussian Academy. At the same time he
                    continued his philosophical contributions to the Academy of St Petersburg, which
                    granted him a pension in 1742. The respect in which he was held by the Russians
                    was strikingly shown in 1760, when a farm he occupied near Charlottenburg
                    happened to be pillaged by the invading Russian army On its being ascertained
                    that the farm belonged to Euler, the general immediately ordered compensation to
                    be paid, and the empress Elizabeth sent an additional sum of four thousand
                    crowns. In 1766 Euler with difficulty obtained permission from the king of
                    Prussia to return to Petersburg, to which he had been originally invited by
                    Catherine II. Soon after his return to St Petersburg a cataract formed in his
                    left eye, which ultimately deprived him almost entirely of sight. It was in
                    these circumstances that he dictated to his servant, a tailor’s apprentice, who
                    was absolutely devoid of mathematical knowledge, his <hi rend="italic">Elements
                    of Algebra,</hi> a work which, though purely elementary, displays the
                    mathematical genius of its author, and is still reckoned one of the best works
                    of its class. Another task to which he set himself immediately after his return
                    to St Petersburg was the preparation of his <hi rend="italic">Lettres à une
                    Princesse</hi><hi rend="italic">eΓ</hi><hi rend="italic">Allemagne sur quelques
                    sujets de Physique</hi> (3 vols., 1768-72). They were written at the request of
                    the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, and contain an admirably clear exposition of the
                    principal facts of mechanics, optics, acoustics, and physical astronomy. Theory,
                    however, is frequently unsoundly applied in it, and it is to be observed
                    generally that Euler’s strength lay rather in pure than in applied mathematics.
                    In 1755 Euler had been elected a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences at
                    Paris, and some time afterwards the academical prize was adjudged to three of
                    his memoirs <hi rend="italic">Concerning the Inequalities in the Motions of the
                    Planets.</hi> The two prize-questions proposed by the same academy for 1770 and
                    1772 were designed to obtain a more perfect theory of the moon’s motion. Euler,
                    assisted by his eldest son Johann Albert, was a competitor for these prizes, and
                    obtained both. In the second memoir he reserved for further consideration
                    several inequalities of the moon’s motion, which he could not determine in his
                    first theory on account of the complicated calculations in which the method he
                    then employed had engaged him. He afterwards reviewed his whole theory with the
                    assistance of his son and Krafft and Lexell, and pursued his researches until he
                    had constructed the new tables, which appeared, together with the great work, in
                    1772. Instead of confining himself, as before, to the fruitless integration of
                    three differential equations of the second degree, which are furnished by
                    mathematical principles, he reduced them to the three ordinates which determine
                    the place of the moon; and he divided into classes all the inequalities of that
                    planet, as far as they depend either on the elongation of the sun and moon, or
                    upon the eccentricity, or the parallax, or the inclination of the lunar orbit.
                    The inherent difficulties of this task were immensely enhanced by the fact that
                    Euler was virtually blind, and had to carry all the elaborate computations it
                    involved in his memory. A further difficulty arose from the burning of his house
                    and the destruction of the greater part of his property in 1771. His manuscripts
                    were fortunately preserved. His own life was only saved by the courage of a
                    native of Basel, Peter Grimmon, who* carried him out of the burning house.</p>
                <p>Some time after this the celebrated Wenzell, by couching the cataract, restored
                    Euler’s sight; but a too harsh use of the recovered faculty, along with some
                    carelessness on the part of the surgeons, brought about a relapse. With the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n691/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0691-0666"/> assistance of his sons, and of Krafft and Lexell,
                    however, he continued his labours, neither the loss of his sight nor the
                    infirmities of an advanced age being sufficient to check his activity. Having
                    engaged to furnish the Academy of St Petersburg with as many memoirs as would be
                    sufficient to complete its acts for twenty years after his death, he in seven
                    years transmitted to the academy above seventy memoirs, and left above two
                    hundred more, which were revised and completed by another hand.</p>
                <p>Euler’s knowledge was more general than might have been expected in one who had
                    pursued with such unremitting ardour mathematics and astronomy as his favourite
                    studies. He had made very considerable progress in medical, botanical, and
                    chemical science, and he was an excellent classical scholar, and extensively
                    read in general literature. He was much indebted to an uncommon memory, which
                    seemed to retain every idea that was conveyed to it, either from reading or
                    meditation. He could repeat the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> of Virgil from the
                    beginning to the end without hesitation, and indicate the first and last line of
                    every page of the edition which he used. Euler’s constitution was uncommonly
                    vigorous, and his general health was always good. He was enabled to continue his
                    labours to the very close of his life, so that it was said of him that he ceased
                    to calculate and to breathe at nearly the same moment. His last subject of
                    investigation was the motion of balloons, and the last subject on which he
                    conversed wife the neλvly discovered planet Herschel. On the 18th September
                    1783, whilst he was amusing himself at tea with one of his grandchildren, he was
                    struck with apoplexy, which terminated his illustrious career at the age of
                    seventy-six. Euler’s genius was great, and his industry still greater. His
                    works, if printed in their completeness, would occupy from 60 to 80 quarto
                    volumes. He was simple and upright in his character, and had a strong religious
                    faith. He was twice married, his second wife being a half-sister of his first,
                    and he had a numerous family, several of whom attained to distinction. His <hi
                    rend="italic">éloge</hi> was written for the French Academy by Condorcet, and an
                    account of his life, with a list of his works, was written by Von Fuss, the
                    secretary to the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg.</p>
