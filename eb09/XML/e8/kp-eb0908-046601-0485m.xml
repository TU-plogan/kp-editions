                    plain itself, at the distance of about a mile. The situation of the city was
                    such as at all times to command a great commerce. Of the three great river
                    basins of western Asia Minor, those of the Hermus, Caÿster, and Maeander, it
                    commanded the second, and had ready access by easy passes to the other two,
                    besides being the natural port and landing-place for Sardes, the capital of the
                    Lydian kings.</p>
                <p>The earliest inhabitants assigned to Ephesus are the mythical Amazons, who are
                    said to have founded the city, and to have been the first priestesses of the
                    Asiatic Artemis. With the Amazons we hear of Leleges and Pelasgi as in
                    possession. In the 11th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> according to
                    tradition, Audroclus, son of the Athenian king Codrus, landed on the spot with
                    his Ionians, and from this conquest dates the history of the Greek Ephesus. But
                    here the Ionians by no means succeeded in absorbing the races in possession or
                    superseding the established worship. Their city was firmly established on
                    Coressus and Prion, between which hills lies the city harbour; but the old
                    inhabitants still clustered in the plain around the sanctuary of Artemis. When,
                    however, we call the deity of Ephesus Artemis, we must guard against
                    misconception. Really she was a primitive Asiatic goddess of nature of the same
                    class as Mylitta and Cybele, the mother of vegetation and the nurse of wild
                    beasts, an embodiment of the fertility and productive power of the earth. She
                    was represented in art as a stiff erect mummy, her bosom covered with many
                    breasts, in which latter circumstance Guhl sees allusion to the abundance of
                    springs which arise in the Ephesian plain. The organization of her worship, too,
                    of which more below, was totally unlike anything Hellenic. It was only by reason
                    of their preconceived ideas that the Ionians found in this outlandish and
                    primitive being a form of Artemis their conductor. The entire history of Ephesus
                    consists of a long series of struggles between Greek and Asiatic manners and
                    religions, between the ideas of the agora and the harbour and those of the
                    precincts of the goddess. This struggle can be traced throughout in the devices
                    of the Ephesian coin, the type of the goddess which appears in it becoming at
                    times Asiatic, at times Hellenic, according to the predominant influence of the
                    period.</p>
                <p>For centuries after the foundation of Audroclus, the Asiatic influences waxed and
                    the Greek waned. Twice in the period 700-500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    city owed its preservation to the interference of the goddess,—once when the
                    swarms of the Cimmerians overran Asia Minor, and once when Crcesus besieged the
                    town, and only retired after it had solemnly dedicated itself to Artemis, the
                    sign of such dedication being the stretching of a rope from city to sanctuary.
                    Croesus wa3 eager in every way to propitiate the goddess, and as at this time
                    her first great temple was building on the plans of the architect Chersiphron,
                    he presented most of the columns required for the building as well as some cows
                    of gold. It is probable that policy mingled with his piety, his object being to
                    make Ephesus Asiatic in character, a harmonious part of the empire he was
                    forming in hither Asia, and then to use the city as a port and by such means
                    counterbalance the growing power of Miletus and other cities of the coast. The
                    mother-city of Ephesus, Athens, seems to have counterworked his projects by
                    despatching one of her noblest citizens, Aristarchus, to restore law on the
                    basis of the Solonian constitution. The labours of Aristarchus seem to have
                    borne fruit. It was an Ephesian follower of his, Hermodorus, who aided the
                    Decemviri at Rome in their compilation of a system of law. And in the same
                    generation Heraclitus, probably a descendant of Codrus, quitted his hereditary
                    magistracy in order to devote himself to philosophy, in which his name became
                    almost as great as that of any Greek. Poetry had long flourished at Ephesus.
                    From very early times the Homeric poems had found a home and many admirers
                    there; and to Ephesus belong the earliest elegiac poems of Greece, the war songs
                    of Callinus, who flourished in the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    and was the model of Tyrtaeus. And yet that on the whole Crcesus was successful
                    in-his schemes seems certain. When the Ionian revolt against Persia broke out in
                    the year 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> under the lead of Miletus, Ephesus
                    remained submissive to Persian rule; and when Xerxes returned from the march
                    against Greece, he honoured the temple of Artemis, and even left his children
                    behind at Ephesus for safety’s sake. After the great Persian defeat, Ephesus for
                    a time paid tribute to Athens, with the other cities of the coast, and Lysander
                    first and afterwards Agesilaus made it their headquarters.</p>
                <p>In the year 356 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> on the same night on which
                    Alexander the Great was born, an incendiary named Herostratus, wishing only to
                    make his name famous, if even by a monstrous crime, set fire to that temple of
                    Artemis which Chersiphron had planned, and which had been later enlarged or even
                    rebuilt by Paeonius in the 5th century. With the greatest eagerness the
                    Ephesians set about its reconstruction on a still more splendid scale. The
                    ladies of the city sold their jewellery, and neighbouring cities sent
                    contributions, many of the massive columns being the gift <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n486/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0486-0467"/> of kings. Though Alexander the Great, after his
                    victories, offered to pay the whole cost of reconstruction, on condition that he
                    might inscribe his name as dedicator on the pediment, his offer was refused. The
                    temple was rapidly completed, and was considered in after times the most perfect
                    model of Ionic architecture, and one of the seven wonders of the world. The
                    recent excavations of Mr Wood have enabled us to form a fairly exact notion of
                    its details, as will be seen below. The architect employed was Dinocrates, and
                    Scopas was one of the sculptors employed in the decoration.</p>
                <p>Alexander established a democratic government at Ephesus. Soon after his death
                    the city fell into the hands of Lysimachus, who determined to impress upon the
                    city a more Hellenic character, and to destroy the ancient barbarizing
                    influences. To this end he compelled, it is said by means of an artificial
                    inundation, the people who dwelt in the plain by the temple to migrate to the
                    Greek quarter ou the hill now identified as Coressus, which he surrounded by a
                    solid wall. He recruited the numbers of the inhabitants by transferring thither
                    the people of Lebedus and Colophon, and finally, in order to make the breach
                    with the past complete, renamed the city after his wife Arsinoë. But the former
                    influences soon reasserted themselves, and with the old name returned Asiatic
                    superstition and Asiatic luxury. The people were again notorious for wealth, for
                    their effeminate manner of life, and for their devotion to sorcery and
                    witchcraft. After the defeat of Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, by the
                    Romans, Ephesus was handed over by the conquerors to Eumenes, king of Pergamus,
                    whose successor, Attalus Philadelphus, worked the city irremediable harm.
                    Thinking that the shallowness of the harbour was due to the width of its mouth,
                    he built a mole part-way across the latter; the result, however, was contrary to
                    his wishes, the silting up of the harbour with saud proceeding now at a greater
                    pace than before. The third Attalus of Pergamus bequeathed Ephesus with the rest
                    of his possessions to the Roman people, when it became the capital of the
                    province of Asia, and the residence of the proconsul. Henceforth Ephesus
                    remained subject to the Romans until the barbarian invasions, save for a short
                    period, when, at the instigation of Mithradates, the cities of Asia Minor
                    revolted and massacred their Roman residents. The Ephesians even dragged out and
                    slew those Romans who had fled to the precincts of Artemis for protection,
                    notwithstanding which they soon returned from their new to their former masters,
                    and even had the effrontery to state, in an inscription preserved to this day,
                    that their defection to Mithradates was a mere yielding to superior force.
                    Sulla, after his victory over Mithradates, brushed away their pretexts, and
                    after inflicting on them a very heavy fine, told them that the punishment fell
                    far short of their deserts. In the civil wars of the 1st century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Ephesians were so unfortunate as twice to support
                    the unsuccessful party, giving shelter to, or being made use of by, first Brutus
                    and Cassius and afterwards Antony, for which partisanship or weakness they paid
                    very heavily in fines.</p>
                <p>All this time the city was gradually growing in wealth and in devotion to the
                    service of Artemis, a devotion which had become quite fanatical at the time of
                    St Paul’s visit. The story of his doings there need not be repeated; the
                    supplement of them is, however, very suggestive,—the burning, namely, of books
                    of sorcery to a great value. Addiction to the practise of occult arts was always
                    general in the city. The Christian church which St Paul planted was nurtured by
                    St John, and is great in Christian tradition as the nurse of saints and martyrs.
                    It v∖as, however, long before the spread of Christianity threatened the <hi
                    rend="italic">cultus</hi> of Artemis. The city was proud to be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">neocorus,</hi> or servant of the goddess. Roman emperors vied with
                    wealthy natives in lavish gifts to her, one Vibius Salutaris among <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0487-0468"/> the latter presenting a quantity of gold and
                    silver images to be carried annually in procession. Ephesus contested stoutly
                    with Smyrna and Pergamus the honour of being called the first city of Asia; each
                    city appealed to Rome, and we still possess rescripts in which the emperors
                    endeavour to mitigate the bitterness of the rivalry. The Goths destroyed both
                    city and temple in the year 262 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.;</hi> and although the
                    city revived, it never recovered its former splendour. A general council of the
                    church was held there in 341; but by the 15 th century it had sunk into a
                    wretched village, the name of which, Ayasaluk, is now known to be a corruption
                    of the title of St John, Hagios Theologos. The ruins of the temple, after
                    serving as a quarry to the beautifiers of Constantinople, the Turkish
                    conquerors, and the mediaeval Italians, were finally covered deep with mud by
                    the river Caÿster, and its true site was unsuspected until the laborious
                    excavations of Mr Wood were rewarded with success in the year 1869.</p>
                <p>The organization of the temple hierarchy, and its customs and privileges,
                    retained throughout an Oriental and somewhat ascetic tinge. The priestesses of
                    the goddess, termed Melissae or bees, were virgins, and her priests were
                    compelled to celibacy. The chief among the latter, who bore the Persian name of
                    Megabyzus and the Greek title Neocorus, was doubtless a power in the state as
                    well as a dignitary of religion. Besides these, there was a vast throng of
                    dependants who lived by the temple and its services,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >theologi,</hi> who may have expounded sacred legends, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hymnodi,</hi> who composed hymns in honour of the deity, and others, together
                    with a great crowd of <hi rend="italic">hieroduloe</hi> who performed more
                    menial offices. The making of shrines and images of the goddess occupied many
                    hands. To support this greedy mob offerings were flowing in in a constant stream
                    from votaries and from visitors, who contributed sometimes money and sometimes
                    statues and works of art. These latter so accumulated that the temple became a
                    rich museum, among the chief treasures of which were the figures of Amazons
                    sculptured in competition by Phidias, Polycletus, Cresilas, and Phradmon, and
                    the painting by Apelles of Alexander holding a thunderbolt. The temple was also
                    richly endowed in lands, and possessed the fishery of the Selinusian lakes, with
                    other large revenues. But perhaps the most important of all the privileges
                    possessed by the goddess and her priests was that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >asylum.</hi> Fugitives from justice or vengeance who reached her precincts were
                    perfectly safe from all pursuit and arrest. The boundaries of the space
                    possessing such virtue were from time to time enlarged. Mithradates extended
                    them to a bow-shot from the temple in all directions, and Mark Antony
                    imprudently allowed them to take in part of the city, which part thus became
                    free of all law, and a haunt of thieves and villains. Augustus, while leaving
                    the right of asylum untouched, diminished the space to which the privilege
                    belonged, and built round it a wall, which still surrounds the ruins of the
                    temple at the distance of about a quarter of a mile, bearing au inscription in
                    Greek and Latin, which states that it was erected in the proconsulship of
                    Asinius Gallus, out of the revenues of the temple. Besides being a place of
                    worship, a museum, and a sanctuary, the Ephesian temple was a great bank.
                    Nowhere in Asia could money be more safely bestowed than here; therefore both
                    kings and private persons placed their treasures under the guardianship of the
                    goddese.</p>
                <p>The government of the city is a matter of some obscurity. We know that for some
                    time after its foundation it was ruled by kings of the race of Codrus, and
                    afterwards by archons who belonged to the same stock. In the time of Lysander it
                    was under an oligarchy; Alexander re-established the democracy. We have the
                    titles of several magistrates in imperial times, but without exactly knowing
                    their functions. The tumult raised by Demetrius against Paul was quelled by the
                    town-clerk or recorder (γpαpμ,ατeυς). Inscriptions mention archons, strategi,
                    gymnasiarchs, paedonomi, and Asiarchs, besides the religious functionaries; but
                    no doubt the chief power rested with the senate and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >demos.</hi></p>
                <p>The topography of Ephesus was but very imperfectly known until the excavations
                    conducted by Mr J. T. Wood on behalf of the trustees of the British Museum
                    during the years 1863-74. He first explored the Odeum and the Great Theatre
                    situate in the city itself, and in the latter place had the good fortune to find
                    an inscription which indicated to him in what direction to search for the
                    temple, for it stated that processions came to the city from the temple by the
                    Magnesian gate, and returned by the Coressian. These two gates were next
                    identified, and following up that road which issued from the Magnesian gate, Mr
                    Wood lighted first on the tomb of Androclus, and afterwards on an angle of the
                    peribolus wall of the time of Augustus. He next found and excavated the site of
                    the temple of Artemis. He found remains of more than one temple; three separate
                    floors being clearly distinguishable one above the other. Of these the lowest
                    consisted of a layer of charcoal between two of putty. It is probable that this
                    was the floor of the temple of Croesus’s time, which Chersiphron was said to
                    have made with charcoal and fleeces. Above this lowest floor were two others of
                    marble, which would seem to have belonged, one to the temple burned by
                    Herostratus, the other to that erected on its ruins immediately afterwards. Of
                    this latter bqjlding the remains were sufficient to enable Mr Wood to restore it
                    with considerable accuracy. The dimensions of it, taken at the lowest step of
                    the flight which led up to the peristyle on all sides, were 418 feet 1 inch by
                    239 feet 4J inches. The number of the external columns was 100, their height
                    about 56 feet. It is observable that the dimensions given by Pliny seem to be in
                    every case incorrect. The most remarkable fact about the columns is that many of
                    them were sculptured with figures in high relief to a man’s height <pb

                    by the sculptor Scopas, and certainly the existing fragments of sculptured
                    columns now recovered and preserved in the British Museum are not the work of
                    common hands. The fragments of sculptured frieze found in the excavations would
                    seem to prove that the frieze was adorned with representations of Hercules,
                    Theseus, and the Amazons. The <hi rend="italic">&lt;∙&gt;∕matium</hi> was
                    decorated with the conventional honey-suckle ornament, intercepted by fine
                    lions’ heads. The roof was covered with flat marble tiles. The whole edifice was
                    octastyle, having eight columns at the ends, and dipteral, with two rows of
                    columns all round. Fragments were also found which appear to belong to the 6th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and as some of these are parts of
                    sculptured columns, it would seem that the temple of Chersiphron had set to the

                <p>The best works on Ephesus are those of Guhl, Falkener, Ernst Curtius, and J. T.
                    Wood. The first of these writers has collected most of the ancient authorities;
                    the last has been successful in topographical researches. The accompanying plans
                    are from his book, and are inserted by his kind permission, and that of Messrs
                    Longmans and Co., publishers. The first gives the general plan of the city, and
                    the road to the temple. The second gives the scheme of the temple, the fragments
                    of walls and columns found by Mr Wood in position being represented black. (P.
