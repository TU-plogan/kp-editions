                    future poet. At school Ebenezer was considered a dull pupil; and his childhood
                    was solitary. A touching autobiographic fragment, which appeared after his death
                    in the Athenaeum for 1850, and is republished in Watkins’s life of the poet,
                    gives a deeply interesting account of his early years. His imagination had an
                    unhealthy craving for the horrible, and gloated over the faces of those who had
                    died a violent death, till he was cured by the sight of a body floating in a
                    canal, in an advanced state of decomposition. A more pleasing part of the
                    autobiography tells of hi3 passion for making models of ships, kites, &amp;c. In
                    a very important sense the child was father of the man in Elliott’s case, for
                    “even in those days,” he says, “I was a free trader, though I knew it not.” His
                    father, exasperated at Ebenezer’s persistent indolence at school, put him into
                    the foundry with which he was himself connected, where the manufacturing
                    processes interested him. The sight of some fine botanical plates in Sowerby’s
                    English Botany led him to love flowers, and to gather them as copies for
                    drawing, although not to a taste for botany, “the classifications of which
                    seemed tobe like preparations for sending flowers to prison” (Autobiography). In
                    his Sunday rambles he encountered a snake, which fascinated him so much that he
                    visited it weekly, and called it “my first snake-love.” This is probably the new
                    form his love for what is generally considered loathsome assumed. These walks,
                    by bringing him in contact with the beauty and freshness of nature, proved the
                    foundation of his passion for poetry, which was first gratified by his brother
                    Giles reading Thomson’s Seasons aloud to him. Acting on his first impulse, he
                    rushed out into the garden to verify the description of the polyanthus and
                    auricula; and his earliest poetic effusion was an imitation of Thomson. He now
                    set about a systematic study of English grammar, but was greatly hindered by a
                    memory singularly defective for rules and classifications, although so strong in
                    other respects that he “almost knew the Bible by heart” when he was twelve years
                    old, and could repeat three books of the Paradise Lost when he was sixteen.
                    About the end of Ebenezer’s fourteenth year, a poor curate called Firth
                    bequeathed his library to Mr Elliott—a circumstance which had a great influence
                    on the development of the poet’s genius Barrow, λ oung, Shenstone, and Milton
                    were special favourites; and, after he had studied them thoroughly, Shakespeare,
                    Ossian, Junius, Schiller’s Bobbers, and Gibbon’s Decline and Fall were eagerly
                    read. Elliott’s first published poem, The Vernal Walk, was soon followed by
                    Night, or the Legend of Wharnclijfe, and the Tales of Night, embracing Bothwell
                    and the Exile, dedicated respectively to Southey and Bulwer. Another volume
                    contained Love, The Letter, They Met Again, and Withered Wild Flowers. Then came
                    the epic fragment entitled Spirits and Men. The fruits of his thoughts on
                    political subjects were seen in the lianter and the Corn-Law Rhymes, of which a
                    third edition appeared in 1831. His other important poems are The Village
                    Patriarch (1831), The Splendid Village, and the Corn Law Hymns. Many gems are to
                    be found among his Miscellaneous Poems; but the dramas entitled Kerhoηah and
                    Taurassdes are the least happy of his productions. After his death appeared More
                    Prose and Verse in two volumes. His chief works were published between 1830 and
                    1836. He carried on business as an iron-founder in Sheffield for 20 years
                    (1821-41), in which he was so successful that he retired to an estate at Great
                    Houghton, near Barnsley, in 1841, where he resided till his death, which took
                    place on the 1st of December 1849. A few weeks before he died, his daughter was
                    married to John Watkins, his future biographer. Elliott lives in history by his
                    determined opposition to the “bread-tax,” as he called the corn laws, the sad
                    results of which he expressed in such terribly vivid lines as the following
                    :—</p>
                <p>“I bought his coffin with my bed,</p>
                <p>My gown bought earth and prayer;</p>
                <p>I pawn’d my mother’s ring for bread,</p>
                <p>I pawn’d my father’s chair.”</p>
                <p>Even when he reached comparative affluence himself, he remained the sturdy
                    champion of the poor, whose representative in the Rhymes says :—</p>
                <p>“And workhouse bread ne’er crossed my teeth,—</p>
                <p>I trust it never will.”</p>
                <p>Elliott’s poetry is stamped throughout by the grandeur of his personal character.
                    Transparent sincerity and passionate earnestness meet us in every page. His
                    poems are beautifully described by Carlyle as “hues of joy and harmony, painted
                    out of troublous tears.” To be a reformer of the world was his ambition: and the
                    purely literary spirit, which looks at life mainly as affording materials for
                    artistic conceptions, was utterly foreign to his nature. Crabbe’s genius cast a
                    spell over Elliott; although it can scarcely be said that a man of such rugged
                    originality was a slavish imitator of any one. His works reflect the joy with
                    which a poet escapes from the smoke, glare, and noise of city life to drink in
                    the sweet air of country lanes and fields. Yorkshire scenery especially is
                    embalmed in his verse. Although Elliott had no great respect for theological
                    dogma, there is a genuine religious vein in his poetry. His works have engaged
                    the pens of men endowed with loftier literary genius than his own, including
                    Professor V ilson, Southey, Bui wer, and Carlyle.</p>
                <p>In addition to the life by Watkins, there is a biography by January Searle; and
                    an edition of his poems has been issued by his son, the Rev. E&lt;lwin Elliott
                    of St John s, Antigua.</p>
