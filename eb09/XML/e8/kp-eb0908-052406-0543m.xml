                    affluent of the Araxes, about 171 miles S.S.W. of Tiflis by road. The old
                    Persian portion of the town consists mainly of narrow crooked lanes inclosed by
                    mud walls, which effectually conceal the houses, and the modern Russian portion
                    is laid out in long ill-paved streets. On a steep rock, rising about 600 feet
                    above the κiver, stands the old Turkish fortress, surrounded by ditches and
                    earthen ramparts, and containing within its area part of the palace of the
                    ancient Persian governors, a handsome but greatly dilapidated mosque, a Greek
                    church of modern erection, a cannon foundry, and barracks. One chamber, called
                    the Hall of the Sardar, bears witness to the former splendour of the palace by
                    its pictorial decorations, which include legendary and historical scenes from
                    the lives of Zal and Rustam, of Abbas-Mirza and Nadir Shah. The finest building
                    in the city is undoubtedly the mosque of Hussein Ali Khan, familiarly known as
                    the Blue Mosque from the colour of the enamelled tiles with which it is richly
                    encased. At the mosque of Zal Khan a yearly passion play is performed
                    illustrative of the assassination of Hussein the son of Ali. Besides the
                    episcopal church of St Sergius <hi rend="italic">(Sourp Sarghis),</hi> the
                    Armenians possess five churches, a monastery, and a seminary. Several hundred
                    travellers can be accommodated in the new caravanserai; and there is a club
                    which in some degree makes up for the absence of hotels. The bazaar, though
                    extensive, is poorly supplied with goods; and the only manufactures of the town
                    are a little cotton cloth, leather, earthenware, and blacksmiths’ work. The
                    fruits of the district are exceedingly cheap, and noted for their
                    excellence—especially the grapes, apples, apricots, and melons. The surrounding
                    country is richly watered by a system of canals connected with the Gokcha or
                    Sevanga Lake and the river Zengui. Armenians, Persians, and Tatars are the main
                    elements in the population, to which is added a certain number of Russians and
                    Greeks—making a total in 1874 of 30,000.</p>
                <p>The origin of Erivan is altogether unknown. One pious Armenian tradition
                    recognizes in the name the joyful exclamation of Noah at the reappearance of the
                    dry ground— <hi rend="italic">Erevan,</hi> it has shown itself; another explains
                    it as equivalent to <hi rend="italic">Erovantavan,</hi> the place of defeat of
                    Erovant II. of Armenia; and a third identifies it with the name of Rewan Kul,
                    who built a castle about 1412 on the spot at the command of Shah Ismail. The
                    present fortress at any rate was erected by the Turks in the 16th century, and
                    since that time the place has been of considerable celebrity. It was taken by
                    the Persians under Shah Abbas in 1604, besieged by the Turks for four months in
                    1615, and reconquered by the Persians under Nadir Shah in the 18th centuιy. In
                    1780 it was successfully defended against Heraclius of Georgia; and in 1804 it
                    resisted the Russians under Prince TsitsianofF. At length in 1827 Paskievitch
                    took the fortress by storm, and in the following year the town and province were
                    ceded to Russia by the peace of Turkmanchai. The successful general was rewarded
                    by the title of Count of Erivan (Erivanski). A Tatar poem in celebration of the
                    event has been preserved by Bodenstedt in his “Thousand and One Days in the
                    East.”</p>
