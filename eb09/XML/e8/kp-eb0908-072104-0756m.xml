                    The date of his birth is, however, uncertain, and varies between 260 and 270. We
                    know little of his youth beyond the fact that he was a diligent student of
                    sacred literature, his biography by his episcopal successor Acacius having
                    perished. It was as a student, and probably as holding some inferior office in
                    the church at Caesarea, that he became connected with Pamphilus who was at the
                    head of a theological school there, and devoted himself to the collection of a
                    church library, especially to the care and defence of the writings of his great
                    master Origen. In the course of the Diocletian persecution, which broke out in
                    303, Pamphilus was imprisoned for two years, and finally suffered martyrdom.
                    During the time of his imprisonment (307-9) Eusebius distinguished himself by
                    assiduous devotion to his friend, spent days with him in affectionate
                    intercourse, and is supposed to have actively assisted him in the preparation of
                    an apology for Origen’s teaching, which survives in the Latin of Rufinus (Routh,
                    <hi rend="italic">IieUq.,</hi> iv. 339). After the death of Pamphilus Eusebius
                    withdrew to Tyre, where he was kindly received by the Bishop Paulinus, and
                    afterwards, while the Diocletian persecution still raged, went to Egypt, where
                    he was imprisoned, but soon released. His release at the time suggested an
                    accusation made against him more than twenty years afterwards by Potamon, the
                    fiery bishop of Heraclea, that he had apostatized. “Who art thou,
                    Eusebius,’’exclaimed Potamon at the famous council of Tyre, which condemned
                    Athanasius, “to judge the innocent Athanasius. Didst thou not sit with me in
                    prison in the time of the tyrants? They plucked out my eye for my confession of
                    the truth; thou camest forth unhurt. How didst thou escape ?” The coarseness of
                    the accusation, however, was only in the spirit of the times, and it rests on no
                    evidence whatever. The elevation of Eusebius to the see of Caesarea so soon
                    afterwards, in 315 at latest—probably 313—is of itself sufficent to dispose of
                    any such charge. Here Eusebius laboured and became a conspicuous figure in the
                    church till the year of his death, 340. The patriarchate of Antioch was put
                    within his offer in 331, but he preferred the less eminent sphere associated
                    with his early studies and friends, and as probably more congenial to his
                    literary tastes and pursuits.</p>
                <p>The character of Eusebius, both as a man and a theologian, is intimately bound up
                    with the part which he took at the council of Nicaea, and afterwards in the
                    great controversy connected with the work of that council. His conduct and his
                    views have been differently judged, according to the estimate which later
                    critics have formed of the merits of this controversy, and the dogmatic
                    prejudices which on one side or the other it is apt to engender. Dr Newman, for
                    example, in his history of the Arians in the 4th century, speaks of him as
                    “openly siding with the Arians, and sanctioning and sharing their deeds of
                    violence,” while most Anglican scholars, from Bull and Cave to Dr Samuel Lee of
                    Cambridge, who translated the <hi rend="italic">Theophania</hi> of Eusebius in
                    1843 from a recently recovered Syriac MS., have warmly defended his orthodoxy.
                    The same division of opinion regarding him has prevailed more or less in other
                    quarters, and even in the age succeeding his own. It is only in the scientific
                    theology of Germany, and especially in Dorner’s great work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Person of Christ,</hi> that his true theological position can be
                    said to have been made clear. He was certainly not Arian, however he may have
                    defended Arius personally, any more than he was Athanasian. He was really the
                    representative of the indeterminate theology of the church on the great point in
                    dispute, before the lines of controversy on the one side and the other had
                    hardened into the formulae which have become identified with the two positions
                    known as Arianism and Athanasianism. To judge and still more to condemn him from
                    one side or the other is to mistake the law of the historical development cf
                    dogma, and to apply to him conclusions which belong to a later type of thought
                    than that in which he had been trained. This will be best seen by a brief
                    explanation of his stand-point, both personal and theological, throughout the
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>When the Arian controversy broke forth, about 319, Arius, who possibly may have
                    known something of Eusebius during his stay in Egypt, besought his intervention
                    to pacify the misunderstanding between him and his bishop, Alexander. Eusebius
                    responded so far as to write two letters to Alexander explaining that Ariιιs was
                    misrepresented (Fragm. in Mansi, xiii. 316). This fact is of interest, as
                    showing his natural attitude in the controversy before the calling of the
                    council of Nicaea. At this council he attended as the special friend of
                    Constantine, whom he was appointed to receive with a panegyrical oration, and at
                    whose right hand he enjoyed the honour of sitting. Not only so, but he prepared
                    and submitted the first draft of the creed which was afterwards, with well-known
                    and significant additions, adopted by the council. The whole difference between
                    Eusebius and the Athanasians centred in these additions, and in fact in the
                    famous expression “Homoousion”—“of the same substance” which was judged
                    necessary by the council to express the true relation of the Father and the Son.
                    He resisted this expression to the last, and only at length accepted it and
                    subscribed the creed <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n757/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0757-0722"/> at the dictation of the emperor. After the
                    Council he continued to identify himself with the fortunes of the Arian rather
                    than of the Athanasian party, and his great favour at court and his influence
                    with the imperial authorities enabled him to protect the one party at the
                    expense of the other. It is this personal attitude which has mainly identified
                    him with Arianism. In so far as he was a partisan, and lent himself to the
                    persecution of the “orthodox” or Athanasians, the conduct of Eusebius is
                    deserving of the censure that has been bestowed upon it. But it is to be
                    remembered that from his own theological stand-point he was disposed to regard
                    the treatment of Arius by his opponents as indefensible, and to consider his
                    opinions as tenable within the church. In short the Athanasians were to him the
                    innovators in doctrine rather than Arius, who only maintained a stand-point that
                    many had held in the church before him, even if he restlessly drew unfounded
                    conclusions from it, whereas the Athanasian development evidently appeared to
                    Eusebius to go beyond the older and less determinate doctrine in which he had
                    been trained. The special defect of Eusebius seems to have been a lack of that
                    spiritual and speculative insight which sees the true drift of opinions, and
                    detects below the surface of language a true from a false line of development of
                    Christian thought. Às Domer says of the theological position at the time, it was
                    clear that the church had arrived at a point at which it could not stand still,
                    but must choose one or other of two courses,—either to take a step in advance
                    and define the indefinite, or to go backwards either into heathenism or into
                    Judaism.</p>
                <p>The opinions of Eusebius himself may be summarized as follows. God is with him
                    One, or the Monas, exalted in his supreme essence above all plurality. He is
                    Being absolutely, <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> *0μ, or the primal substance, ή
                    <hi rend="italic">πρώτη Ουσία.</hi> Thus essentially conceived, God is
                    infinitely above the world, His relation to which is in and through the Son,
                    “who is the image of the invisible, the first born of every creature” (Col. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">l</hi> 15). He would have substituted the Greek of the latter
                    expression, <hi rend="italic">πρωτότοκος πόσης κτίσεως,</hi> instead of the
                    formula fiually adopted in the Nicene creed, that the Son is <hi rend="italic"
                    >όμοοΰσιος</hi> τω <hi rend="italic">πaτpi,</hi> “of the same substance with the
                    Father.” But in no sense did he recognize the'Son as Himself a creature or as
                    sprung like other creatures, <hi rend="italic">εξ oυκ ovτωv.</hi> He was not
                    “the same as the Father, of equal power and glory,” because the idea of the
                    Divine is conceivably complete in God as One; but He was begotten of the Father
                    before all worlds or aeons. He was in a true sense <hi rend="italic"
                    >άναρχος,</hi> “without beginning in time.” Eusebius repudiated therefore the
                    Arian formula, “There was a time when the Son was not;” he could even say, “the
                    Son was always with the Father,” τω <hi rend="italic">πατρί</hi> ως <hi
                    rend="italic">υιόν</hi> διά <hi rend="italic">παντός συνάντα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Dein.</hi><hi rend="italic">Εν.,</hi> 4, 8), yet he shrunk from
                    calling the Son σ-υvαiδιos or “co-eternal” with the Father. While holding, in
                    short, in his own sense to the true divinity of the Son, he shrunk from
                    attempting to define either with the Arians or the Athanasians the relation
                    between the Father and the Son, as beyond human conception. The nearest image by
                    which the relation could be conceived was that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ευωόία</hi><hi rend="italic">(Dem. Ev.,</hi> 4, 3), or the relation between a
                    flower and its perfume. He seems to have preferred this to the image of light
                    and its brightness, or “light of light,”—although both this phrase and the
                    associated phrase “God of God” surviving in the Nicene creed were in the
                    original “profession of faith” which he submitted to the council. From this
                    brief statement it is evident that Eusebius was not himself doctrinally an
                    Arian, however he may have favoured the Arian party. He was separated from it on
                    the essential poiut, that the Son was in no sense a creature or made, <hi
                    rend="italic">⅛ oυκ 0vτωv.</hi> The name Exoucontian, by· which the Arians came
                    to be specifically known, could never have been applied to him. On the other
                    hand, he is separated from the Athanasians chiefly by the twofold conception of
                    Deity, now as the semi-Platonic Monas or ’Or, abiding in unapproachable
                    self-existence, and now as the Divine Father self-revealing Himself in the Son,
                    and in the world created by the Son. As his mind dwelt on the idea of Deity pure
                    and simple, or as absolute Being, he seems to have recoiled from the identity of
                    the Supreme God with the Logos; but as he dwelt on the idea of <hi rend="italic"
                    >the Divine in relation to the world,</hi> he saw in the Logos or Son the full
                    expression of the Divine—the organ or power through whom all created existence
                    is called into being. There is, in other words, with him a “sensus eminens” in
                    which God is One, alone in power and glory; but the Christian or revealed
                    conception of God is nevertheless acknowledged by him as Trinitarian. According
                    to Domer’s explanation of the Eusebian theology, “God’s being a Trinity depends
                    <hi rend="italic">on His will.</hi> At the same time this does not mean that God
                    might be other than Trinitarian, for it is impossible to God not to will the
                    perfect.”</p>
                <p>These views of Eusebius are chiefly contained in his well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demonstratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangelica,</hi> in the first book of his
                    lately discovered treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Theophania,</hi> and in his
                    treatise against Marcellus, who in extreme reaction from Arianism taught a
                    doctrine approaching Sabellianism.</p>
                <p>It only remains further to add that Eusebius is undoubtedly more of a writer and
                    critic than of a thinker. He is admitted to have excelled in mere erudition all
                    the church fathers, hardly excepting Origen and Jerome. But his writings are
                    arid and artificial in style, with an air of compilation rather than of original
                    power. His <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> is destitute of method
                    or graphic interest of any kind, but is a valuable repertory of the opinions of
                    the Christian writers of the 2d or 3d century, whose works have otherwise
                    perished. It has been charged with personality and inaccuracy by Gibbon, but
                    without adequate evidence. (See general estimate of Eusebius as an historian,
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Church History,</hi> vol. v., p. 764.) The personal
                    relations of Eusebius to Constantine have been, like other points of his life,
                    variously judged. He was undoubtedly more of a courtier than was becoming in a
                    Christian bishop, and in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Constantine</hi> has
                    written an extravagant panegyric rather than a biography of the emperor.
                    Altogetherjιe is a conspicuous and significant, rather than a great or noble
                    figure in the history of the church.</p>
                <p>Of Eusebius’s works the most important are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi> in ten books,—comprising
                    the history of the church from the ascension of Christ to the defeat and death
                    of Licinius, 324 A.n. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Chronicon,</hi> in two
                    books,—comprising an historical sketch, with chronological tables, of the most
                    important events in the history of the world from the days of Abraham till the
                    twentieth year of the reign of Constantine. This work, which is one of great
                    importance in the study of ancient history, was published in its complete form
                    for the first time at Milan in 1818. 3. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proeparatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangelica,</hi> in fifteen books,</p>
                <p>—a collection of facts and quotations from the work of nearly all the
                    philosophers of antiquity, intended to prepare the reader s mind for the
                    acceptance of the Christian evidences. 4. '1 lie <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demonstratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangelica,</hi> in twenty books, of which
                    ten are extant, —a learned and valuable treatise on the evidences themselves. It
                    is intended to complete the Christian argument for which the previous work was a
                    preparation. In addition there are various minor works of Eusebius, viz., the
                    <hi rend="italic">Theophania,</hi> in four bcpks, translated from a Syriac MS.,
                    discovered by Tattam in an Italian monastery in 1839; his treatises against
                    Marcellus in two books, and against Hierocles; his life of Constantine— <hi
