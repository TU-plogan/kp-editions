                    believe an old tradition, under Roeland Savery at Utrecht. He wandered in 1645
                    to Haarlem, where he studied under Peter de Molyn, and finally settled about
                    1657 at Amsterdam, where lie remained till his death, It would be difficult to
                    find a greater contrast than that which is presented by the works of Savery and
                    Everdingen. Savery inherited the gaudy style of the Breughels, which he carried
                    into the 17th century; whilst Everdingen realized the large and effective system
                    of coloured and powerfully shaded landscape which marks the precursors of
                    Rembrandt. It is not easy on this account to believe that Savery was
                    Everdingen’s master, while it is quite within the range of probability that he
                    acquired the elements of landscape painting from De Molyn. Pieter de Molyn, by
                    birth a Londoner, lived from 1624 till 1661 in Haarlem. He went periodically on
                    visits to Norway, and his works, though scarce, exhibit a broad and sweeping
                    mode of execution differing but slightly from that transferred at the opening of
                    the 17th century from Jan van Goyen to Solomon Ruysdael. His etchings have
                    nearly the breadth and effect of those of Everdingen. It is still an open
                    question when De Molyn wielded influence on his clever disciple. Alkmaar, a busy
                    trading place near the Texel, had little of the picturesque for an artist except
                    polders and downs or waves and sky. Accordingly we find Allart at first a
                    painter of coast scenery. But on one of his expeditions he is said to have been
                    cast ashore in Norway, and during the repairs of his ship he visited the inland
                    valleys, and thus gave a new course to his art. In early pieces he cleverly
                    represents the sea in motion under varied, but mostly clouded, aspects of sky.
                    Their general intonation is strong and brown, and effects are rendered in a
                    powerful key, but the execution is much more uniform than that of Jacob
                    Ruysdael. A dark scud lowering on a rolling sea near the walls of Flushing
                    characterizes Everdingen’s Mouth of the Schelde in the Hermitage at St
                    Petersburg. Storm is the marked feature of sea-pieces in the Staedel or Robartes
                    collections; and a strand with wreckers at the foot of a cliff in the Munich
                    Pinakothek may be a reminiscence of personal adventure in Norway. But the
                    Norwegian coast was studied in calms as well as in gales; and a fine canvas
                    belonging to Professor Piloty at Munich shows fishermen on a still and sunny day
                    taking herrings to a smoking hut at the foot of a Norwegian crag. The earliest
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n771/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0771-0736"/> Everdingen’s sea pieces belongs to Mr Von Friesen
                    at Dresden, and bears the date of 1640. After 1645 we meet with nothing but
                    representations of inland scenery, and particularly of Norwegian valleys,
                    remarkable alike for wildness and a decisive depth of tone. The master’s
                    favourite theme is a fall in a glen, with mournful fringes of pines interspersed
                    with birch, and log huts at the base of rocks and craggy slopes. The water
                    tumbles over the foreground, so as to entitle the painter to the name of
                    “inventor of cascades.” It gives Everdingen his character as a precursor of
                    Jacob Ruysdael in a certain form of landscape composition; but though very
                    skilful in arrangement, and clever in effects, Everdingen remains much more
                    simple in execution; he is much less subtle in feeling or varied in touch than
                    his great and incomparable countryman. Five of Everdingen’s cascades are in the
                    museum of Copenhagen alone: of these, one is dated 1647, another 1649. In the
                    Hermitage at Petersburg is a fine example of 1647; another in the Pinakothek at
                    Munich was finished in 1656. English public galleries ignore Everdingen; but one
                    of his best-known masterpieces is the Norwegian glen belonging to Lord Listowel.
                    Few Continental museums lack pictures by this master. Their value in the market
                    is about a third to a half of those of Ruysdael; but excepting the later and
                    more neglected pieces, they are all clever and generally attractive. At
                    Amsterdam, we may think, Everdingen chiefly produced etchings and drawings, of
                    which there are much larger and more numerous specimens in England than
                    elsewhere. Being a collector as well as an engraver and painter, he brought
                    together a large number of works of all kinds and masters; and the sale of these
                    by his heirs at Amsterdam on the 11th of March 1676 gives an approximate clue to
                    the date of the painter’s death.</p>
