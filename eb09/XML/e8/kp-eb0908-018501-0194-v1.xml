                    paintings executed with vehicles in which wax is the chief ingredient. The term
                    was appropriately applied to the ancient methods of painting in wax, because
                    these required heat to effect them. Max, however, may now be used as a vehicle
                    for painting without heat being reαuisite: nevertheless the ancient term
                    encaustic has <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0195-0186"/> been retained, and is indiscriminately
                    applied to all methods of painting in wax. The durability of wax, and its power
                    of resisting the effects of the atmosphere, were well known to the Greeks, who
                    used it for the protection of their sculptures. As a vehicle for painting it
                    •was commonly employed by them and by the Romans and Egyptians; but in recent
                    times it has met with only a limited application. Of modern encaustic paintings
                    those by Schnorr in the Residenz at Munich are the most important. At present
                    there is no general agreement as to which is the best method of using wax for
                    mural painting. Modern paintings in wax, in their chromatic range and in their
                    general effect, occupy a middle place between those executed in oil and in
                    fresco. Wax painting is not so easy as oil, but presents fewer technical
                    difficulties than fresco.</p>
                <p>Ancient authors often make mention of encaustic, which, if it had been described
                    by the word inurere, to burn in, one might have supposed to have been a species
                    of enamel painting, But the expressions “incausto pingere,” “pictura
                    encaustica,” “ceris pingere,” “pictura inurere,” used by Pliny and other ancient
                    writers, make it clear that some other species of painting is meant. Pliny
                    distinguishes three species of encaustic painting. In the first they used a
                    stylus, and painted either on ivory or on polished wood, previously saturated
                    with some certain colour; the point of the stylus or stigma served for this
                    operation·, and its broad or blade end cleared off the small filaments which
                    arose from the outlines made by the stylus in the wax preparation. In the second
                    method it appears that the wax colours, being prepared beforehand, and formed
                    into small cylinders for use, were smoothly spread by the spatula after the
                    outlines were determined, and thus the picture was proceeded with and finished.
                    By the side of the painter stood a brazier, which was used to heat the spatula
                    and probably the prepared colours. This is the method which was probably used by
                    the painters who decorated the houses of Herculaneum and of Pompeii, as artists
                    practising this method of painting are depicted in the decorations. This method
                    has recently been revived in Italy. The third method was by painting by a brush
                    dipped into wax liquefied by heat; the colours so applied attained considerable
                    hardness, aud could not be damaged either by the heat of the sun or by the
                    effects of sea-water. It was thus that ships were decorated; and this kind of
                    encaustic was therefore styled “ship painting.”</p>
                <p>About the year 1749 Count Cay lus, and M. Bachelier, a painter, made some
                    experiments in encaustic painting, and the count undertook to explain an obscure
                    passage in Pliny, supposed to be the following (xxxv. 39) :—“Ceris pingere ac
                    picturam inurere quis primus excogitaverit non constat. Quidam Aristidis
                    inventum putant, postea consummatum a Praxitele; sed aliquanto vetustiores
                    encausticae picturae extitere, ut Polygnoti et Nicanoris et Arcesilai Pariorum.
                    Lysippus quoque Aeginae pioturae suae inscripsit εWκαυσev, quod profecto non
                    fecisset nisi encaustica inventa.” There are other passages in Pliny bearing
                    upon this subject, in one of which (xxi. 49) he gives an account of the
                    preparation of “Punica cera.” The nature of this Punic wax, which was the
                    essential ingredient of the ancient painting in encaustic, has not been
                    definitely ascertained. The Chevalier Lorgna, who investigated the subject in a
                    small but valuable tract, asserts that the nitron which Pliny mentions is not
                    the nitre of the moderns, but the natron of the ancients, viz., the native salt
                    which is found crystallized in Egypt and other hot countries in sands
                    surrounding lakes of salt water. This substance the Carthaginians, according to
                    Pliny, used in preparing their wax, and hence the name Punic seems to be
                    derived. Lorgna made a number of experiments with this salt, using from three to
                    twenty parts of white melted wax with one of natron. He held the mixture in an
                    iron vessel over a slow fire, stirring it gently with a wooden spatula, till the
                    mass assumed the consistency of butter and the colour of milk. He then removed
                    it from the fire, and put it in the shade in the open air to harden. The wax
                    being cooled liquefied in water, and a milky emulsion resulted from it like that
                    which could be made with the best Venetian soap.</p>
                <p>Experiments, it is said, were made with this wax in painting in encaustic in the
                    apartments of the Count Giovanni Battista Gasola by the Italian painter Antonio
                    Paccheri, who dissolved the Punic wax when it was not so much hardened as to
                    require to be “igni resoluta,” as expressed by Pliny, with pure water slightly
                    infused with gum-arabic, instead of sarcocolla, mentioned by Pliny. He
                    afterwards mixed the colours with this wax so liquefied as he would have done
                    with oil, and proceeded to paint in the same manner; nor were the colours seen
                    to run or alter in the least; and the mixture was so flexible that the pencil
                    ran smoother than it would have done with oil. The painting being dry, he
                    treated it with caustic, and rubbed it with linen cloths, by which the colours
                    acquired peculiar vivacity and brightness.</p>
                <p>About the year 1755 further experiments were made by Count Caylus and several
                    French artists. One method was to melt wax with oil of turpentine as a vehicle
                    for the colours. It is well known that wax may be dissolved in spirit and used
                    as a medium, but it dries too quickly to allow of perfect blending, and would by
                    the evaporation of the spirit be prejudicial to the artist’s health. Another
                    method suggested about this time, and one which seems to tally very well with
                    Pliny’s description·, is the following. Melt the wax with strong solution of
                    salt of tartar, and let the colours be ground up in it. Place the picture when
                    finished before the fire till by degrees the wax melts, swells, and is bloated
                    up upon the picture; the picture is then gradually removed from the fire, and
                    the colours, without being injuriously affected by the, operation of the fire,
                    become unalterable, spirits of wine having been burnt upon them without doing
                    the least harm. Count Caylus’s method was different, and much simpler:—(1) the
                    cloth or wood designed for the picture is waxed over, by rubbing it simply with
                    a piece of beeswax; (2) the colours-are mixed up with pure water; but as these
                    colours will not adhere to the wax, the whole ground must be rubbed over with
                    chalk or whiting before the colour is applied; and (3) when the picture is dry
                    it is put near the fire, whereby the wax is melted and absorbs the colours. It
                    must be allowed that nothing could well be simpler than this process, and it was
                    thought that this kind of painting would be capable of withstanding the weather
                    and of lasting longer than oil painting. This kind of painting has not the gloss
                    of oil painting, so that the picture may be seen in any light, a quality of the
                    very first importance in all methods of mural painting. The colours too, when so
                    secured, are firm, and will bear washing, and have a property which is perhaps
                    more important still, viz., that exposure to smoke and foul vapours merely
                    leaves a deposit on the surface without injuring the work. The “encausto
                    pingendi” of the ancients could not have been enamelling, as the word “inurere,”
                    taken in its rigorous sense, might at first lead one to suppose, nor could it
                    have been painting produced in the same manner as encaustic tiles or encaustic
                    tesserae; but that it must have been something akin to the count’s process
                    wo∖ιld appear from the words of Pliny already quoted, “Ceris pingere ac picturam
                    inurere.”</p>
                <p>Werner of Neustadt found the following process very effectual in making wax
                    soluble in water. For each pound of white wax he took twenty-four ounces of
                    potash, which he dissolved in two pints of water, warming it gently. In this ley
                    he boiled the wax, cut into little bits, for half an <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0196-0187"/> hour, after which he removed it from the fire
                    and allowed it to cool. The was floated on the surface of the liquor in the form
                    of a white saponaceous matter; and th⅛ being triturated with water produced a
                    sort of emulsion, which he called wax milk, or encaustic wax. This preparation
                    may be mixed with all kiuds of colours, and consequently can be applied in a
                    single operation.</p>
                <p>Mrs Hooker of Rottingdeau made, at the end of the last century, many experiments
                    to establish amethod of painting in wax, and received a gold palette from the
                    Society of Arts for her investigations in this branch of art. Her account is
                    printed in the tenth volume of the Society’s Transactions (1792), under the name
                    of Miss Emma Jane Greenland. The following is an abstract of her processes
                    :—</p>
                <p>Put into a glazed earthen vessel four ounces and a half of gum arabic, and eight
                    ounces or half a pint wine measure of cold spring water; when the gum is
                    dissolved, stir in, over alow fire, seven ounces of gum mastic, continually
                    stirring and beating hard with a spoon, in order to dissolve the gum mastic.
                    When sufficiently boiled the mixture will no longer appear transparent, but will
                    become opaque and stiff like a paste. As soon as this is the case, and the gum
                    water and mastic are quite boiling, without taking them off the fire, add five
                    ounces of white wax, broken into small pieces; stir and beat till the wax is
                    perfectly melted and boils; then take the composition oil the fire, as boiling
                    it longer than necessary would harden the wax, and prevent it afterwards from
                    mixing well with water. When the composition is taken off the fire, it should be
                    beaten well whilst hot (but not boiling) in the glazed earthen vessel; mix with
                    it by degrees a pint or sixteen ounces more of cold spring water, then strain
                    the composition, and bottle it. The composition if properly made should be like
                    cream, and the colours when mixed with it as smooth as with oil. Mix with the
                    composition on a china palette any powder colours which may be required to the
                    consistency of oil colours; then paint with pure water. In painting with this
                    composition the colours blend without difficulty when wet, and even when dιy the
                    tints may be easily' united by means of a brash and a very small quantity of
                    water. The painting being finished, heat some white wax in a glazed earthen
                    vessel over a slow fire till melted, but not boiling; then with a hard brush
                    cover the painting with the wax; when cold take a moderately hot iron, such as
                    is used for ironing linen, and which will not “hiss” when put to the usual test,
                    and draw it lightly over the wax. The painting will appear as if under a cloud,
                    till the wax and the substance the picture is painted upon are perfectly cold;
                    but if then it should not appear sufficiently clear, the wax may be melted by
                    holding a hot iron at a proper distance from it, especially before such portions
                    of the picture as do not appear sufficiently transparent or brilliant; for the
                    oftener heat is applied to the picture the greater will be the transparency and
                    the brilliancy of the colouring; but the contrary effect would be the result
                    were the heat applied too suddenly, in too great a degree, or for too long a
                    time. When the picture is cold, rab it with a fine linen cloth. Γlaster surfaces
                    require no other preparation than a coating of the composition.</p>
                <p>It would be equally practicable to paint with wax alone, dissolved in gum water.
                    Take three quarters of a pint of cold spring water, and four ounces and a half
                    of gum arabic, put them into a glazed earthen vessel, and when the gum is
                    dissolved, add eight ounces of white wax. Put the earthen vessel, with the gum
                    water and wax, upon a slow fire, and stir them till the wax is dissolved, and
                    when the mixture has boiled a few minutes, take it off the fire, and throw it
                    into a basin, as by remaining in the hot earthen vessel the wax would become
                    rather hard; beat the gum water and wax till quite cold. It is necessary to use
                    some pure water in mixing this composition with the colours. If the ingredients
                    should separate when bottled, they have only to be well shaken together. This
                    composition may be kept for a long time, and be rendered fit for use by putting
                    a little cold water upon it for a short time.</p>
                <p>The following is a recent receipt. Place in a large pipkin, half full of hot
                    turpentine, as much gum dammar as will dissolve (⅜ lb gum makes about 1⅜ pints
                    varnish); melt from two to two and a half of the wax tablets sold by chemists in
                    a pint of this varnish; when cold the composition should just be consistent
                    enough to sfctnd up on the palette. If too thin, heat it again, and add wax; it
                    too thick add turpentine. This vehicle may be used with ordinary oil colours.
                    15efore commencing your work heat the wall, and rub in as much vehicle as it
                    will absorb; after the work is finished it should be re-heated, to secure its
                    adhesion to the wall.</p>
