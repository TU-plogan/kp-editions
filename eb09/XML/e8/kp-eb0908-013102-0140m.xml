                <p><label type="entry">ELGIN AND KINCARDINE, <hi rend="smallcaps">James Bruce, Earl
                    of</hi></label> (1811-1863), was the eighth earl of Elgin and twelfth earl of
                    Kincardine in the peerage of Scotland, and the first Baron Elgin in that of the
                    United Kingdom. The eldest son of Thomas, the seventh earl, by his second
                    marriage he was born in 1811, and succeeded to the peerage in 1841. He was
                    educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he had as companions and
                    rivals his younger predecessors in the office of governor-general of India,
                    Dalhousie and Canning. Mr Gladstone also waβ one of his juniors at both school
                    and college, and recalls the circumstance that it was from young Bruce he “first
                    learned that Milton had written any prose.” As a young man he came into contact
                    with Dr Chalmers, who induced him to speak in public on church extension, and it
                    was to Chalmers’s sermon on the “Expulsive Power of a New Affection” that he
                    turned on his deathbed, repeating many passages from it in the last hour. He sat
                    in the House of Commone for Southampton long enough to attach him to the
                    constitutional principles now described <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0141-0132"/> as Liberal-Conservative, though he never
                    identified himself with a party.</p>
                <p>Lord Elgin began his official career in 1842, at the age of thirty, as governor
                    of Jamaica. He succeeded the great Indian civilian, Lord Metcalfe, who had left
                    the colony in such a state of quietude and prosperity as w as possible soon
                    after emancipation. During an administration of four years he succeeded in
                    winning the respect of all classes. He improved the condition of the negroes and
                    conciliated the planters by working through them. In 1846 Lord Grey appointed
                    him governor-general of Canada. Son-in-law of the popular earl of Durham, he was
                    well received by the colonists, and he set himself deliberately to carry out the
                    policy which makes Lord Durham’s name remembered there with gratitude to this
                    day. Alike from his political experience in England and his life in Jamaica Lord
                    Elgin had learned that safety lay in actiug as the moderator of all parties,
                    while applying fearlessly the constitutional principles of the mother country to
                    each difficulty as it arose. In this his frank and genial manners also aided him
                    powerfully. His assent to the local measure for indemnifying those who had
                    suffered in the troubles of 1837 led the mob of Montreal to pelt his carriage
                    for the rewarding of rebels for rebellion, as Mr Gladstone described it. But
                    long before his eight years’ term of service expired he was the most popular man
                    in Canada. His relations with the United States, his hearty support of the
                    self-government and defence of the colony, and his settlement of the free-trade
                    and fishery questions, moreover, led to his being raised to the British
                    peerage.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return to England in 1854, Lord Palmer- ·ston offered him a seat
                    in the Cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, which he declined. But
                    when, in 1856 the seizure of the “Arrow” by Commissioner Yeh plunged England
                    into war with China, he at once accepted the appointment of special envoy with
                    the expedition. On reaching Point de Galle he was met by a force summoned from
                    Bombay to Calcutta by the news of the sepoy mutiny at Meerut on the 11th May.
                    His first idea, that the somewhat meagre intelligence would justify most
                    energetic action in China, was at once changed when urgent letters from Lord
                    Canning reached him at Singapore, the next port, on the 3d June. H.M.S.
                    “Shannon” was at once sent on to Calcutta with the troops destined for China,
                    and Lord Elgin himself followed it, when gloomier letters from India reached
                    him. The arrival of the “Shannon” gave new life to the handful of white men
                    fighting for civilization against fearful odds, and before the reinforcements
                    from England arrived the back of the mutiny had been broken. Nor was the
                    position in China seriously affected by the want of the troops. Lord Elgin sent
                    in his ultimatum to Commissioner Yeh at Canton on the same day, the 12th
                    December, that he learned the relief of Lucknow, and he soon after sent Yeh a
                    prisoner to Calcutta. By July 1858, after months of Chinese deception, he was
                    able to leave the Gulf of Pecheli with the emperor’s assent to the Treaty of
                    Tiensin, whereby concessions were made such as all civilized peoples grant to
                    each other, if only from self-interest. The treaty sanctions the residence of
                    foreign ambassadors in Peking—long secured by the Russians, guarantees
                    protection to Christians, opens the country to travellers with passports, and
                    the Yang-tzse and five additional ports to trade, under a revised tariff. The
                    sum of .£650,000 was exacted for losses at Canton, and an equal sum for the
                    expenses of the war. Following the Americans, the apparently successful
                    plenipotentiary visited Japan, and obtained less considerable concessions from
                    its Government in the Treaty of Yeddo. It is true that the negotiations were
                    confined to the really subordinate Tycoon or Shogoon, holding an office since
                    abolished, but that visit proved the beginning of British innuence in the most
                    progressive country of Asia. L <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> nfortunately, the
                    Chinese difficulty was not yet at an end. After tedious disputes with the
                    tariff’ commissioners as to the opium duty, and a visit to the upper waters of
                    the Yang-tzse, Lord Elgin had reached England in May 1859. But when his brother
                    and the allied forces attempted to proceed to Peking with the ratified treaty,
                    they were fired on from the Taku forts at the mouth of the Peiho. The Chinese
                    had resolved to try the fortune of war once more, and Lord Russell again sent
                    out Lord Elgin as ambassador extraordinary to demand an apology for the attack,
                    the execution of the treaty, and an indemnity for the military and naval
                    expenditure. Sir Robert Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala), and Sir Hope
                    Grant, with the French, so effectually routed the Tatar troops and sacked the
                    Summer Palace that by the 24th October 1860 a convention was concluded, which
                    was “entirely satisfactory to Her Majesty’s Government.” The treaty and
                    convention have regulated the relations of China with the West to the present
                    time (1878). In the interval between the two visits to China, Lord Elgin held
                    the office of postmaster-general in Lord Palmerston’s administration, and was
                    elected lord rector of the university of Glasgow. He had not been a month at
                    home after the second visit when the same premier selected him to be Her
                    Majesty’s viceroy and governor-general of India.</p>
                <p>Lord Elgin had now attained the object of his honourable ambition, after the
                    office had been filled in most critical times by his juniors and old college
                    companions, the marquis of Dalhousie and the Earl Canning. He succeeded a
                    statesman who had done much to reorganize the whole administration of India,
                    shattered as it had been by the mutiny. Long, too long in grappling with it, as
                    he himself afterwards confessed, Lord Canning had atoned for the sluggishness of
                    his early action by the vigour of his two last years of office, and established
                    his popularity on the firm basis of his land-tenure reforms and his foreign or
                    feudatory policy. Lord Elgin could only develop both, and he recognized this as
                    what he called his “humble task.” But, as the first viceroy directly appointed
                    by the Crown, and as subject to the secretary of state for India, Lord Elgin at
                    once gave up all Lord Canning had fought for, in the co-ordinate independence,
                    or rather the stimulating responsibility, of the governor-general, which had
                    prevailed from the days of Clive and Warren Hastings. From his time to the
                    present the old powers of the historic governorgeneral have been overshadowed by
                    the party influences of the Indian secretary. This subservience was seen in a
                    further blow at the legislature, by which a bill could be published without
                    leave from the Calcutta council, and in the reversal of Lord Canning’s measure
                    for the sale of a fee-simple tenure with all its political as well as economic
                    advantages. But, on the other hand, Lord Elgin loyally carried out the wise and
                    equitable policy of his predecessor towards our feudatories with a firmness and
                    a dignity that in the case of Holkar and Oudeypore had a good effect. He did his
                    best to check the aggression of the Dutch in Sumatra, λvhich was contrary to
                    treaty, and he supported Dost Mahomed in Cabul until that aged warrior entered
                    the then neutral and disputed territory of Herat. Determined to maintain
                    inviolate the integrity of our own north-west frontier, Lord Elgin assembled a
                    camp of exercise at Lahore, and marched a force to the Peshawur border to punish
                    those branches of the Yusufzai tribe who had violated the engagements of
                    1858.</p>
                <p>It was in the midst of this “little war” that he died. Soon after his arrival at
                    Calcutta, he had projected the usual tour to Simla, to be followed by an
                    inspection of the Punjab and its warlike ring-fence of Pathans. He even
                    contemplated the summoning of the central legislative <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n142/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0142-0133"/> council at Lahore. After passing the summer of
                    1863 in the cool retreat of Peterhoff, Lord Elgin began a march across the hills
                    from Simla to Sealkote by the upper valleys of the Beas, the Ravee, and the
                    Chenab, chiefly to decide the two allied questions of tea cultivation and trade
                    routes to Kashgaria and Tibet. The climbing up to the Rötung Pass (13,000 feet)
                    which separates the Beas valley from that of the Chenab, and the crossing of the
                    frail twig bridge across the Chundra torrent, prostrated him by the time he had
                    descended into the smiling English like Kangra valley. Thence he wrote his last
                    letter to Sir Charles Wood, still full of hope and not free from anxiety as to
                    the Sittana expedition. At the lovely hill station of Dhurmsala, “the place of
                    piety,” he lay on his deathbed, watching the glories of the Himalayan autumn,
                    and even directing Lady Elgin where to select his grave in the little cemetery
                    around the station church, which hangs high on the bluff above the house where
                    he breathed his last. After telegraphing his resignation to the Queen, he lay
                    for a fortuight amid sacred words and holy thoughts, tended by loving and
                    skilful hands, and suddenly gave up the fight with agony on the 20th November
                    1863. He died of fatty degeneration of the muscular fibre of the heart. He is
                    the second governor-general whose body has a resting-place in India, Lord
                    Cornwallis having found a grave at Ghazeepore, during his second administration.
                    It is vain to speculate what Lord Elgin might have been had he lived to apply
                    the experience gathered during his eventful apprenticeship to Indian
                    administration. Sir John (now Lord) Lawrence, the great Bengal civilian, took up
                    his task. Lord Elgin will be best remembered as the quietly successful
                    governor-general of Canada for eight years.</p>
