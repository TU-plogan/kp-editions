                    (1701-1782), an eminent but eccentric mathematician, was born May 14, 1701, at
                    Hurworth, near Darlington, where his father Dudley Emerson, also a mathematician
                    of high attainments, taught a school. From him young Emerson received a thorough
                    mathematical education, and the bequest of a good mathematical library. For his
                    classical training he was indebted to the curate of Hurworth, who lodged in his
                    father’s house. In the earlier part of his life he followed his father’s
                    profession, but with little success; and this, coupled with the fact of his
                    having received as an only child a moderate competence from his parents, led him
                    to devote himself entirely to studious retirement. Towards the close of 1781 he
                    relinquished his studies and disposed of his library. His death took place soon
                    after, May 20, 1782, at* his native village, in the eighty-first year of his
                    age. Emerson in dress, manners, and appearance was eccentric and indeed
                    clownish, but he possessed remarkable independence of character, and
                    intellectual energy of a very high order. The boldness with which he expressed
                    his opinions on religious subjects led to his being charged with scepticism, but
                    for this there was no foundation. He invariably shut <pb break="no"

                    his works, and carefully revised them sheet by sheet himself, so that they are
                    singularly free from errata. In mechanics, he never advanced a proposition which
                    he had not previously tested in practice, nor published an invention without
                    first proving its effects by a model. Emerson was married, but had no family.
                    His wife employed her leisure in spinning on a curious wheel, of which an
                    accurate drawing is given in his Mechanics. His own favourite recreation was
                    fishing. He was skilled in the science of music, the theory of sounds, and the
                    ancient and modern scales; but he never attained any excellence as a
                    performer.</p>
