                    was pastor, besides being superintendent of the electoral dioceses of Thuringia,
                    Saiz, and Sangerhausen. After having received his first instruction in classics
                    from his father, and in the gymnasium of his native town, lie was sent at the
                    age of sixteen to the celebrated Saxon cloister school of Pforta. At twenty he
                    entered the university of Wittenberg, and studied afterwards at the university
                    of Leipsic. In 1730 he was made master in the faculty of philosophy. In the
                    following year he accepted the office of conrector in the Thomas school of
                    Leipsic, of which J. M. Gesner was then rector; and on Gesner’s being called in
                    1734 as professor of rhetoric to Gottingen, he succeeded him as rector. He waβ,
                    in 1742, named extraordinary professor of ancient literature in the university
                    of Leipsic, and in 1756 promoted to the ordinary professorship of rhetoric. Here
                    his reputation as a scholar, and his rational treatment of biblical exegesis,
                    paved the way for his entrance into the theological faculty, in which he
                    received his doctor’s degree in 1758. Through the elegance of his learning, and
                    his manner of discussion, he co-operated with Baumgarten of Halle in disengaging
                    dogmatic theology from the scholastic and mystical excrescences with which it
                    wfts then deformed, and thus paved the way for a revolution in theology. He
                    died, after a short illness, in his seventy-sixth year, September 11, 1781.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps as much from the impulse which Ernesti gave to sacred and profane
                    criticism in Germany, as from the intrinsic excellence of his own works in
                    either department, that he must derive his reputation as a philologist or
                    theologian. In conjunction with Gesner, he instituted a new school in ancient
                    literature, while with Semler lie partially co-operated in the revolution of
                    Lutheran theology.</p>
                <p>From the Reformation down to the latter half of the 18th century, Germany was far
                    excelled by Holland in the number and excellence of her philologists; and it was
                    not until the appearance of Gesner and Ernesti, with their somewhat earlier
                    contemporaries, Cortius, Daniel Longolius, and Michael Heusinger, that she could
                    oppose above one <hi rend="smallcaps">oj</hi> two rivals to the great critics of
                    the Dutch schools. Gesner and Ernesti, however, through the influence of their
                    lectures at the greater universities of Göttingen and Leipsic, through the wider
                    extent of their labours in philology, and still.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0546-0527"/>
                <p>more through the greater excellence of their methods, are entitled to be held the
                    founders of the new German school of ancient literature. Both, but especially
                    Ernesti, detected grammatical niceties in the Latin tongue, in regard to the
                    consecution of tenses, for instance, which had escaped preceding critics. His
                    canons are, however, not without exceptions. As an editor of the Greek classics,
                    Ernesti deserves hardly to be named beside his Dutch contemporaries,
                    Hemsterhuis, Valckenaer, Ruhnken, or his colleague Reiske. The higher criticism
                    was not even attempted by Ernesti. But to him and to Gesner the praise is due of
                    having formed, partly by their discipline and partly by their example,
                    philologists greater than them selves, and of having kindled the national
                    enthusiasm for ancient learning.</p>
                <p>As a theologian, Ernesti is far less conspicuous than as a scholar, and his
                    influence is not so marked either on his contemporaries or on his successors. It
                    is, indeed, chiefly in hermeneutics that Ernesti has any claim to the character
                    of a great theologian. But here his merits are distinguished, and, at the period
                    when his <hi rend="italic">Institutio Interpretis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >N.</hi><hi rend="italic">T.</hi> was published, almost peculiar to himself. In
                    it we find the principles of a general interpretation, formed without the
                    assistance of any particular philosophy, but consisting of observations and
                    rules which, though already enunciated, and applied in the criticism of the
                    profane writers, had never rigorously been employed in biblical exegesis. He
                    admits in the sacred writings as in the classics only one acceptation, and that
                    the grammatical, convertible into and the same with the logical and historical.
                    He therefore justly censures the opinion of those who in the illustration of the
                    Scriptures refer everything to the illumination of the Holy Spirit, as well as
                    that of others who, disregarding all knowledge of the languages, would explain
                    words by things, and thus introduce into the holy writings their peculiar
                    glosses and opinions. The “analogy of faith,” as a rule of interpretation, he
                    greatly limits, and teaches that it can never alone afford the explanation of
                    words, but only determine the choice among their possible significations, and
                    must always stand in need of philology as an assistant. Every principle of his
                    interpretation, however, rests on · the assumption of the inspiration of the
                    Scriptures, and he seems unconscious of any inconsistency between that doctrine
                    as usually received and his principles of hermeneutics. It must be admitted that
                    those of his followers who have seen the inconsistency, and endeavoured by one
                    means or other to obviate it, have been more logical than their master. In the
                    higher criticism of the sacred books Ernesti did nothing. In dogmatic he always
                    expressed great contempt of strict systematic theology; and though he lectured
                    for many years on the <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms</hi> of Neumann, it was rather
                    in refutation than in support of his text-book.</p>
