                    dropped into the water by the female in large masses, resembling, in some
                    species, bunches of grapes in miniature Probably several months elapse before
                    the young larvae are excluded. The sub-aquatic condition lasts a considerable
                    time: in <hi rend="italic">Cloeon,</hi> a genus of small aud delicate species,
                    Lubbock proved it to extend over more than six months; but in larger and more
                    robust genera <hi rend="italic">(e.g.&gt; Palingenia</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">*</hi> there appears reason to believe
                    that the greater part o' three years is occupied in preparatory conditions. The
                    larva is elongate. The head is rather large, and is furnished at first with five
                    simple eyes of nearly equal size; but as it increases in size the homologues of
                    the facetted eyes of the imago become larger, whereas those equivalent to the
                    ocelli remain small. The antennae are long and thread-like, composed at first of
                    few joints, but the number of these latter apparently increase at each moult.
                    The mouth parts are well-developed, consisting of an upper lip, powerful
                    mandibles, ordinarily three-jointed maxillary palpi, a deeply quadrifid labium
                    or lower lip, and three-jointed labial palpi. There are three distinct and large
                    thoracic segments, whereof the prothorax is narrower than the others; the legs
                    are much shorter and stouter than in the winged insect, with monomerous tarsi
                    terminated by a single claw. The abdomen consists of ten segments, the tenth
                    furnished with long and slender multi-articulate tails, which appear to be only
                    two in number at first, but an intermediate one gradually develops itself
                    (though this latter is often lost in the winged insect). Respiration is effected
                    by means of external gills placed along both sides of the dorsum of the abdomen
                    and hinder segments of the thorax. These vary in form: in some specie3 they are
                    entire plates, in others they are cut up into numerous divisions, in all cases
                    traversed by numerous tracheal ramifications. According to the researches of
                    Lubbock aud of the Messrs Joly, the very young larvae have no breathing organs,
                    and respiration is effected through the skin. Lubbock traced at least twenty
                    moults in <hi rend="italic">Cloison;</hi> at about the tenth rudiments of the
                    wing-cases began to appear. These gradually become larger, and when so the
                    creature may be said to have entered its “nymph” stage; but there is no
                    condition analogous to the pupa-stage of insects with complete metamorphoses.
                    There may be said to be three or four different modes of life in these larvae;
                    some are fossorial, and form <pb break="no"

                    It will be observed that Tertullian does not accuse him of altering the text
                    Marcion therefore must have read without “at Ephesus,” and must have urged that
                    he was led to this conclusion by his diligent inquiries. It is difficult to see
                    why, in assigning such a reason for his view, he is not to be believed. He could
                    have no <hi rend="italic">dogmatic</hi> interest in adopting the one reading
                    rather than the other. The inferences are (1) that Marcion did not read “at
                    Ephesus;” (2) that even in his time the epistle was generally regarded as
                    addressed to the Ephesians; (3) that he, as the result of careful investigation,
                    believed it to have been addressed to the Laodiceans. · It is more difficult to
                    draw any conclusion from Tertullian’s words as to the reading adopted by
                    himself. There is no doubt force in the argument of Harless and others that,
                    when determining any disputed point with regard to the New Testament, his
                    principles led him to appeal to the authority of tradition and not to critical
                    considerations. But this was in cases where there was a doubt. Here, with “at
                    Ephesus” in the text, there could be none; and it is hardly possible to imagine
                    that, if he had these words before him, he should not, even while resting upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">verUas</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesiae</hi> as sufficient
                    for his purpose, have taken occasion from them to pour out upon the heretic all
                    the vials of his indignant scorn. Instead of that he only speaks, however
                    scornfully, of Marcion’s great diligence in inquiry, and refers to nothing but
                    the “title.” The inferences are (1) that in all probability Tertullian did not
                    read “at Ephesus,” and (2) that he knew of but one tradition in the church
                    reaching back to the earliest times, and unhesitatingly accepted by him, that
                    the epistle had been addressed to the Ephesians.</p>
                <p>The evidence of Origen is important. In a <hi rend="italic">catena</hi>
                    containing part of his lost commentary upon the epistle, that eminent father is
                    quoted as saying that “in the Ephesians alone” has he found the words “to the
                    saints that are;” as inquiring into the meaning of the strange expression; as
                    explaining it by the supposition that of those who are made partakers of the “I
                    am” it may fitly be said “They are;” and as confirming his interpretation by the
                    words of the same Paul, w ho speaks in a similar manner elsewhere, when he
                    writes that “God has chosen the things that are not to bring to nought the
                    things that are.” The inferences are (1) that Origen did not read “at Ephesus,”
                    or he would not have commented as he does, and (2) that he knew the epistle as
                    one to the Ephesians.</p>
                <p>Once more, Basil, about the end of the 4th century, reasons in an exactly similar
                    way, quoting without the expression in dispute, and adding that he had obtained
                    the reading “from those who had gone before him, and from his own study of
                    ancient MSS.” The inferences in his case are the same as in the case of the
                    others already mentioned, with this difference, that the reading “at Ephesus’’
                    was now generally accepted in the church.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to refer to Jerome, while the evidence of the Ignatian epistle,
                    if it may be relied on, simply shows that very early in the 2d century a whole
                    epistle, which can hardly be any other than our present one (the longer
                    recension leaves no doubt upou the point), was believed to have been written by
                    St Paul to the Ephesian church. Some slight force may be added to the testimony
                    of Marcion and Basil by the consideration that both belonged to Asia Minor, and
                    that their sphere of labour was contiguous to the district to one part or
                    another of which the epistle was sent by the apostle.</p>
                <p>In the light of these considerations, the MS. authority in favour of the omission
                    of “at Ephesus” assumes a very different importance from what it might otherwise
                    possess. It is clear that in the first half of the 2d century there were MSS. in
                    circulation which did not read the words; and that, during the 4th century, MSS.
                    then considered “ancient,” which also omitted them, were at least regarded as
                    highly authoritative by distinguished men.</p>
                <p>The internal evidence is even more decisive than the external. Without the words
                    the reading iu question is one of the most difficult of the New Testament. It is
                    almost impossible to give a satisfactory explanation of it. It is at variance
                    with the style of language always used by the apostle on similar occasions. It
                    cannot be explained by the supposition that the dogmatic rendering of which we
                    have spoken was first given to the “are,” and that then, for the sake of this,
                    “at Ephesus” was dropped. With “at Ephesus” in the text, such a dogmatic
                    rendering could hardly have suggested itself, and the name of a place was rather
                    inserted to get rid of it. Finally, except on the supposition that the epistle
                    was addressed directly to Ephesus, a supposition that few will accept, the
                    history of the insertion connects itself with that particular form of the
                    “circular letter” theory which is of all others the most improbable, and most
                    out of keeping with the character of the apostolic age. On the other hand, the
                    insertion of the words was extremely natural. They took the place of nothing
                    where something seemed obviously required. There was no other city whose name
                    would so readily suggest itself for insertion as that of Ephesus. It was the
                    metropolis of the province. St Paul had spent there a longer time than in any
                    other city visited by him on his missionary tours. It was to be expected that he
                    should write to it. The letter was no doubt read in Ephesus; and, leaving that
                    city without any designation of its readers, it would, as it spread thence to
                    all parts of the Christian world, be supposed to have been addressed to the
                    church which was the great centre of its circulation. These considerations, too,
                    would no doubt derive additional weight from the notice in 2 Tim. iv. 12,
                    “Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus,” compared with Eph. vi. 21. Everything, in
                    short, was in favour of the insertion,—everything against the omission.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is probable that the form
                    of the evidence now given is resisted mainly because of the impression that the
                    insertion of “at Ephesus ’ makes easy a reading otherwise almost inexplicable.
                    But this is not the fact. The rendering is as <hi rend="italic">difficult with
                    the words "at Ephesus in the text as without them.</hi> The combination of the
                    verb with the place named is then, indeed, easy enough, and it finds a parallel
                    in Rom. i. 7. But the difficulty lies elsewhere. It lies in the combination of
                    the simple <hi rend="italic">κal πισrοιs</hi> immediately following with this
                    participial clause; and that difficulty is in no degree touched by taking “at
                    Ephesus” into the text. In fact, the difficulty is thus rather increased, the
                    only translation that can then be given, “To the saints which are in Ephesus,
                    and the faithful in Christ Jesus, ’ being ap∙ ρarently inadmissible. Could one
                    only persuade himself to render <hi rend="italic">καί</hi> by “also ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> when “at Ephesus” is dropped, all would be simple,
                    “To the saints who are also faithful in Christ Jesus; ’ but surely St Paul could
                    not have spoken thus.</p></note> On all sides the strength of the argument is
                    irresistible; and we conclude that the words “at Ephesus” form no part of the
                    genuine text of our epistle.</p>
                <p>With the removal of the words “at Ephesus” from the opening of the epistle, the
                    way is cleared for the consideration of the question of its destination. Three
                    main theories require to be shortly noticed. (1.) The first is that the
                    recognized designation is correct. The absence of the words we have found it
                    necessary to eliminate does not of itself prove that the epistle was not sent to
                    Ephesus. It forms a presumption against such a supposition, for St Paul’s
                    practice is to name the churches to which he writes. But it does not do more. As
                    we have already seen, even those fathers who did not read “Ephesus” in i. 1
                    accepted the title “to the Ephesians.” Such had been the tradition of the
                    church, and Marcion alone had questioned its correctness. Great difficulties,
                    however, oppose the reception of this theory. Little stress can indeed be laid
                    o:i the want at the end of the epistle of the greetings so commonly sent <pb

                    others are found on or beneath stones; while others again swim and crawl freely
                    among water plants. It is probable that some are carnivorous, either attacking
                    other larvae or subsisting on more minute forms of animal life; but others
                    perhaps feed more exclusively on vegetable matters of a low type, such as
                    diatoms.</p>
                <p>When the aquatic insect has reached its full growth, it emerges from the water or
                    seeks its surface; the thorax splits down the back, and the winged form appears.
                    But this is not yet perfect, although it has all the form of a perfect insect
                    and is capable of flight; it is what is variously termed a “pseud-imago,”
                    “sub-imago,” or “pro-imago.” Contrary to the habits of all other insects, there
                    yet remains a pellicle that has to be shed, covering every part of the body.
                    This final moult is effected soon after the insect’s appearance in the winged
                    form; the creature seeks a temporary resting-place, the pellicle splits down the
                    back, and the now perfect insect comes forth, often differing very greatly in
                    colours and markings from the condition in which it was only a few moments
                    before. If the observer take up a suitable position near water, his coat is
                    often seen to be covered with the cast sub-imaginal skins of these insects,
                    which had chosen him as a convenient object upon which to undergo their final
                    change. In some few genera of very low type it appears probable that, at any
                    rate in the female, this final change is never effected, and that the creature
                    dies a sub imago.</p>
                <p>The winged insect differs considerably in form from its sub-aquatic condition.
                    The head is smaller, often occupied almost entirely above in the male by the
                    very large eyes, which in some specie3 are curiously double in that sex, one
                    portion being pillared, and forming what is termed a “turban the mouth parts are
                    aborted, for the creature is now incapable of taking nutriment either solid or
                    fluid; the antennae are mere short bristles, consisting of two rather large
                    basal joints and a multi-articulate thread. The prothorax is much narrowed,
                    whereas the other segments (especially the mesothorax) are greatly enlarged; the
                    legs long and slender, the anterior pair often very much longer in the male than
                    in the female; the tarsi four-or five-jointed; but in some genera <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Oligoneuria</hi> and allies) the legs are aborted, and the
                    creatures are driven helplessly about by the wind. The wings are carried erect:
                    the anterior pair large, with numerous longitudinal nervures, and usually
                    abundant transverse reticulation; the posterior pair very much smaller, often
                    lanceolate, and frequently wanting absolutely. The abdomen consists of ten
                    segments; at the end are either two or three long multi articulate tails; in the
                    male the ninth joint bears forcipated appendages; in the female the oviducts
                    terminate at the junction of the seventh and eighth ventral segments. The sexual
                    act takes place in the air, and is of very short duration, but is apparently
                    repeated several times, at any rate in some cases.</p>
                <p>Ephemeridae are found all over the world, even up to high northern latitudes.
                    Pictet, Eaton, and others have given us valuable works or monographs on the
                    family, but the subject still remains little understood, partly owing to the
                    great difficulty of preserving such delicate insects; and it appears probable
                    they can only be satisfactorily investigated as moist preparations. The number
                    of described species is less than 200, spread over many genera.</p>
                <p>From the earliest times attention has been drawn to the enormous abundance of
                    species of the family in certain localities. Scopoli, writing more than a
                    century ago, speaks of them as so abundant in one place in Carniola that in June
                    twenty cart-loads were carried away for manure! <hi rend="italic"

                    England, occurs in many parts of Europe (and is common at Paris), emerges from
                    the water soon after sunset, and continues for several hours in such myriads as
                    to resemble snow showers, putting out lights, and causing inconvenience to man,
                    and annoyance to horses by entering their nostrils. In other parts of the world
                    they have been recorded in multitudes that obscured passers-by on the other side
                    of the street. And similar records might be multiplied almost to any exent. In
                    Britain, although they are often very abundant, we have scarcely anything
                    analogous.</p>

                <p>A singular creature, with a carapace almost like that of a miniature tortoise,
                    originally described by Latreille as a doubtful genus of Branchiopod Crustacea
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Prosopistoma,</hi> of which two species are
                    known (one occurring in France, the other in Madagascar), is now almost proved
                    by Messrs E. &amp; N. Joly to be the aquatic condition of some insect of this
                    family</p>
                <p>Ephemeridae belong to a very ancient type of insects, and their fossil imprints
                    are common, occurring even in the Carboniferous formation. <hi rend="smallcaps"
