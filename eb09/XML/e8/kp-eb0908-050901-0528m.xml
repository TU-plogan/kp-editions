                    to have been of noble birth, the younger branches of patrician families. This we
                    may infer from the statement of Polybius (vi. 20), that the knights <hi
                    rend="italic">naw</hi> are chosen according to fortune,—evidently intimating
                    that their selection had previously depended on a different principle. Romulus
                    is said to have divided them into three centuries or “hundreds,” each century
                    being chosen from one of the three old Roman tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and
                    Luceres. Both Tullus Hostilius and Tarquinius added to their number; but,
                    according to I ivy, it was Servius Tullius (576 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    who first organized them into a distinct body, and compelled the state to
                    contribute annually to their maintenance. It is difficult to perceive in what
                    way we are to explain the statement of Livy (i. 43), that ten thousand pounds of
                    brass were given to each for the purchase of a horse,—an enormous sum when
                    compared with that at which oxen and sheep were rated in the table of penalties.
                    Every eques, of course, was bound to be provided with a good horse, and he may
                    have been obliged to replace it if lost through any casualty in war. Its
                    accoutrements, too, and a slave to take charge of it, were possibly all included
                    in the sum. But whether, when the censor ordered the knight to sell his horse,
                    it was the intention that the outfit money should be refunded to the state, we
                    have no means of determining. Livy tells us also that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vs</hi><hi rend="italic">hordearium</hi> or barley-money supplied to each
                    knight for the maintenance of his horse was obtained bv a tax on widows and
                    orphans. This certainly sounds strange, for it seems inconceivable that there
                    should have been such a large number of rich widows; and even though the word
                    <hi rend="italic">vidua</hi> is explained to mean every single woman, maiden as
                    well as widow, the difficulty still remains. Beyond the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hordearium</hi> the knights received no pay.</p>

                <p>In 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> during the siege of Veii, on account of
                    the want of sufficient cavalry, those who possessed the requisite fortune
                    offered to provide horses at their own expense. These new equites, distinguished
                    as <hi rend="italic">equites equo privato,</hi> in opposition to the <hi
                    rend="italic">equites equo</hi><hi rend="italic">publico,</hi> received regular
                    pay, but, as by the very circumstances of their origin they had neither
                    horse-money <hi rend="italic">(oes</hi><hi rend="italic">equestre)</hi> nor
                    barley-money <hi rend="italic">(aes</hi><hi rend="italic">hordearium),</hi> they
                    formed a distinct body from the old equites, and had no share in any of their
                    peculiar privileges. In 303 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the censors Q. Fabius
                    andP. Decius established a law by which it was ordained that every fifth year a
                    procession of the equites should take place, and that those who had misconducted
                    themselves should be degraded from their rank. The procession <hi rend="italic"
                    >{equiium</hi><hi rend="italic">transvectio)</hi> took place every year on the
                    15th of July <hi rend="italic">(idibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Quintilibus),</hi>
                    the anniversary of the battle of Lake Regillus. The knights in full equipment
                    rode from the Temple of Honour in the south of the city through the Porta Capena
                    and onwards past the temple of Castor and Pollux through the Forum to the
                    Capitol. Their ranks were purged by the censors, before whom they filed past on
                    foot. If the censor had no fault to find, he said to the eques, <hi
                    rend="italic">traduc equum,</hi> lead on your horse; but if he was dissatisfied
                    he said, <hi rend="italic">vende equum,</hi> sell your horse, and the eques
                    ceased to belong to the order. This review bore the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >equitum recognitio,</hi> or, as the Greek writers translate it, ίππεων <hi
                    rend="italic">eπiσκeψι&lt;i.</hi> The equites evidently soon became a very
                    powerful body in the state; yet in 186 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> we find it
                    allowed as a reward to P. Aebutius that the censor should not assign him a
                    public horse, and thereby compel him to serve as an eques against his will,
                    proving that the duties must have been burdensome and regarded by many with
                    distaste. In the later period of the republic the equites increased in power and
                    consequence, and at the same time gradually ceased altogether to be what their
                    name implied, the military service which they had formerly rendered being now
                    obtained from allies and auxiliaries. To be an eques came to mean simply that a
                    man was possessed of a certain amount of wealth without belonging to the
                    senatorial order. The judicial functions were transferred from the senate to the
                    body of equites by the Sempronian law, passed by C. Gracchus about 123 B.c.; and
                    a short time afterwards they became the farmers of the public revenues, by which
                    they were enabled to amass immense riches. They were deprived of their judicial
                    powers by Sulla; but they now possessed too much influence in the state to be
                    excluded from the higher and more dignified offices. After his death they were
                    admitted to their former power, which, however, they shared with the senate.
                    Towards the end of the republic, and under the emperors, the fortune requisite
                    for an eques seems to have been four hundred sestertia, equal to about £3230 of
                    our money; and even at this time knights’horses were furnished by the state, as
                    we find by ancient inscriptions of that period.</p>
                <p>The equites, who still in the reign of Augustus adhered for the most part to the
                    use of the simple iron ring, had before the time of Pliny obtained the right of
                    wearing the golden ring formerly distinctive of the senatorial order. Their
                    dress was a tunic with a narrow purple stripe <hi rend="italic">(tunica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">angusticlavia),</hi> in contrast to the senatorial tunic with a
                    broad stripe <hi rend="italic">(tunica</hi><hi rend="italic">laticlavia).</hi>
                    In 67 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a peculiar privilege was granted them by
                    the Roscian law <hi rend="italic">(lex</hi><hi rend="italic">Roscia
                    theatralis),</hi> which reserved fourteen rows in the theatre behind the
                    senatorial benches for their exclusive use.</p>
                <p>Under the empire appears a class of equites distinguished as <hi rend="italic"
                    >singulares Augusti imperatoris,</hi> which has been the subject of much debate.
                    The epithet <hi rend="italic">singularis</hi> is by some supposed to refer to
                    their possession of a single horse, and by others it is regarded as indicative
                    of their singular rank; but Henzen explains it as equivalent to <hi
                    rend="italic">particularis,</hi> because they were attached to the service of an
                    individual. They formed a sort of body-guard to the emperor, were stationed <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> in Rome, and only under peculiar circumstances were
                    called to serve outside of the city. They appear to have consisted largely of
                    foreigners, more especially from the north of Europe: the names of Germans,
                    Batavians, F risians, F risaevonians, Britons, Helvetians, Dalmatians, Bessians,
                    Thracians, Rhaetians, Pannonians, frequently occur. A considerable number are
                    evidently freedmen who have adopted the name of the reigning emperor on their
                    entrance into his service; but the advantages of the position also attracted not
                    a few of the Roman citizens. At what time the corps was established is unknown:
                    Henzen thinks it was by one of the Flavian emperors, as there is no mention of
                    them under the Julian and Claudian families, but they were certainly in
                    existence under Trajan. They disappear in the reign of Constantine. Their
                    relation to the auxiliaries was similar to that of the praetorians to the Roman
                    army proper. They were under the command of the prefects of the praetorium, and
                    occupied two camps in the city,—one of which was at Torre Pignattara, where
                    their monuments are frequently found.</p>
