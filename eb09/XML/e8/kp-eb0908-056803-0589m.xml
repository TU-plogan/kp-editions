                <p>The hypothesis of an aether has been maintained by different speculators for very
                    different reasons. To those who maintained the existence of a plenum as a
                    philosophical principle, nature’s abhorrence of a vacuum was a sufficient reason
                    for imagining an all-surrounding aether, even though every other argument should
                    be against it. To Descartes, who made extension the sole essential property of
                    matter, and matter a necessary condition of extension, the bare existence of
                    bodies apparently at a distance was a proof of the existence of a continuous
                    medium between them.</p>
                <p>But besides these high metaphysical necessities for a medium, there were more
                    mundane uses to be fulfilled by aethers. Aethers were invented for the planets
                    to swim in, to constitute electric atmospheres and magnetic eflluvia, to convey
                    sensations from one part of our bodies to another, and so on, till all space had
                    been filled three or four times over with aethers. It is only when we remember
                    the extensive and mischievous influence on science which hypotheses about
                    aethers used formerly to exercise, that we can appreciate the horror of aethers
                    which sober-minded men had during the 18th century, and which, probably as a
                    sort of hereditary prejudice, descended even to the late Mr John Stuart
                    Mill.</p>
                <p>The disciples of Newton maintained that in the fact of the mutual gravitation of
                    the heavenly bodies, according to Newton’s law, they had a complete quantitative
                    account of their motions; and they endeavoured to follow out the path which
                    Newton had opened up by investigating and measuring the attractions and
                    repulsions of electrified and magnetic bodies, and the cohesive forces in the
                    interior of bodies, without attempting to account for these forces.</p>
                <p>Newton himself, however, endeavoured to account for gravitation by differences of
                    pressure in an aether (see art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Attraction,</hi> vol. iii.
                    p. G4); but he did not publish his theory, “because he was not able from
                    experiment and observation to give a satisfactory account of this medium, and
                    the manner of its operation in producing the chief phenomena of nature.”</p>
                <p>On the other hand, those who imagined aethers in order to explain phenomena could
                    not specify the nature of the motion of these media, and could not prove that
                    the media, as imagined by them, would produce the effects they were meant to
                    explain. The only aether which has survived is that which was invented by
                    Huygens to explain the propagation of light. The evidence for the existence of
                    the luminiferous aether has accumulated as additional phenomena of light and
                    other radiations have been discovered; and the properties of this medium, as
                    deduced from the phenomena of light, have been found to be precisely those
                    required to explain electromagnetic phenomena.</p>

                    rend="italic">in the propagation of radiation.—</hi> The evidence for the
                    undulatory theory of light will be given in full, under the article on <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> but we may here give a brief summary of it so far
                    as it bears on the existence of the aether.</p>
                <p>That light is not itself a substance may be proved from the phenomenon of
                    interference. A beam of light from a single source is divided by certain optical
                    methods into two parts, and these, after travelling by different paths, are made
                    to reunite and fall upon a screen. If either half of the beam is stopped, the
                    other falls on the screen and illuminates it, but if both are allowed to pass,
                    the screen in certain places becomes dark, and thus shows that the two portions
                    of light have destroyed each other.</p>
                <p>Now, we cannot suppose that two bodies when put together can annihilate each
                    other; therefore light cannot be a substance. What we have proved is that one
                    portion of light can be the exact opposite of another portion, just as + <hi
                    rend="italic">α</hi> is the exact opposite of - <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    whatever <hi rend="italic">a</hi> may be. Among physical quantities we find some
                    which are capable of having their signs reversed, and others which are not. Thus
                    a displacement in one direction is the exact opposite of an equal displacement
                    in the opposite direction. Such quantities are the measures, not of substances,
                    but always of processes taking place in a substance. We therefore conclude that
                    light is not a substance but a process going on in a substance, the process
                    going on in the first portion of light being always the exact opposite of the
                    process going on in the other at the same instant, so that when the two portions
                    are combined no process g0e3 on at all. To determine the nature of the process
                    in which the radiation of light consists, we alter the length of the path of one
                    or both of the two portions of the beam, and we find that the light is
                    extinguished when the difference of the length of the paths is an odd multiple
                    of a certain small distance called a half wave-length. In all other cases there
                    is more or less light; and when the paths are equal, or when their difference is
                    a multiple of a whole wave-length, the screen appears four times as bright as
                    when one portion of the beam falls on it. In the ordinary form of the experiment
                    these different cases are exhibited simultaneously at different points of the
                    screen, so that we see on the screen a set of fringes consisting of dark lines
                    at equal intervals, with bright bands of graduated intensity between them.</p>
                <p>If we consider what is going on at different points in the axis of a beam of
                    light at the same instant, we shall find that if the distance between the points
                    is a multiple of a wave-length the same process is going on at the two points at
                    the same instant, but if the distance is an odd multiple of half a wave-length
                    the process going on at one point is the exact opposite of the process going on
                    at the other.</p>
                <p>Now, light is known to be propagated with a certain velocity (3O04×10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 10</hi> centimetres per second in vacuum, according to
                    Cornu). If, therefore, we suppose a movable point to travel along the ray with
                    this velocity, we shall find the same process going on at every point of the ray
                    as the moving point reaches it. If, lastly, we consider a fixed point in the
                    axis of the beam, we shall observe a rapid alternation of these opposite
                    processes, the interval of time between similar processes being the time light
                    takes to travel a wave-length.</p>
                <p>These phenomena may be summed up in the mathematical expression <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> = A cos <hi rend="italic">(nt - px</hi> + α)</p>
                <p>which gives <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> the phase of the process, at a point whose
                    distance measured from a fixed point in the beam is <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    and at a time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
                <p>We have determined nothing as to the nature of the process. It may be a
                    displacement, or a rotation, or an electrical disturbance, or indeed any
                    physical quantity which is capable of assuming negative as well as positive
                    values. Whatever be the nature of the process, if it is capable of being
                    expressed by an equation of this form, the process going on at a fixed point is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">vibration;</hi> the constant A is called the <hi

                <p>The configuration at a given instant is called a <hi rend="italic">leave,</hi>

                    η</hi>. When we contemplate the different parts of the medium as going through
                    the same process in succession, we use the word undulatory to denote this
                    character of the process without in any way restricting its physical nature.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n591/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0591-0570"/>
                <p>A further insight into the physical nature of the process is obtained from the
                    fact that if the two rays are polarized, and if the plane of polarization of one
                    of them be made to turn round the axis of the ray, then when the two planes of
                    polarization are parallel the phenomena of interference appear as above
                    described. As the plane turns round, the dark and light bands become less
                    distinct, and when the planes of polarization are at right angles, the
                    illumination of the screen becomes uniform, and no trace of interference can be
                    discovered.</p>
                <p>Hence the physical process involved in the propagation of light must not only be
                    a directed quantity or vector capable of having its direction reversed, but this
                    vector must be at right angles to the ray, and either in the plane of
                    polarization or perpendicular to it. Fresnel supposed it to be a displacement of
                    the medium perpendicular to the plane of polarization. Maccullagh and Neumann
                    supposed it to be a displacement in the plane of polarization. The comparison of
                    these two theories must be deferred till we come to the phenomena of dense
                    media.</p>
                <p>The process may, however, be an electromagnetic one, and as in this case the
                    electric displacement and the magnetic disturbance are perpendicular to each
                    other, either of these may be supposed to be in the plane of polarization.</p>
                <p>All that has been said with respect to the radiations which affect our eyes, and
                    which we call light, applies also to those radiations which do not produce a
                    luminous impression on our eyes, for the phenomena of interference have been
                    observed, and the wave-lengths measured, in the case of radiations which can be
                    detected only by their heating or by their chemical effects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elasticity, tenacity, and density of the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oether.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Having so far determined the geometrical
                    character of the process, we must now turn our attention to the medium in which
                    it takes place. We may use the term aether to denote this medium, whatever it
                    may be.</p>
                <p>In the first place, it is capable of transmitting energy. The radiations which it
                    transmits are able not only to act on our senses, which of itself is evidence of
                    work done, but to heat bodies which absorb them; and by measuring the heat
                    communicated to such bodies, the energy of the radiation may be calculated.</p>
                <p>In the next place this energy is not transmitted instantaneously from the
                    radiating body to the absorbing body, but exists for a certain time in the
                    medium.</p>
                <p>If we adopt either Fresnel’s or Maccullagh’s form of the undulatory theory, half
                    of this energy is in the form of potential energy, due to the distortion of
                    elementary portions of the medium, and half in the form of kinetic energy, due
                    to the motion of the medium. We must therefore regard the aether as possessing
                    elasticity similar to that of a solid body, and also as having a finite density.
                    If we take Pouillet*s estimate of 1 ∙7633 as the number of grammecentigrade
                    units of heat produced by direct sunlight falling on a square centimetre in a
                    minute, this is equivalent to 1 ∙234 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> ergs
                    per second. Dividing this by 3Ό04 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi>, the
                    velocity of light in centimetres per second, we get for the energy in a cubic
                    centimetre 41 × 10~ <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> ergs. Near the sun the energy
                    in a cubic centimetre would be about 46,000 times this, or 1 <hi

                    of interplanetary space, but the whole mass of aether within a sphere whose

                    When light travels through the atmosphere it is manifest that the medium through
                    which the light is propagated is not the air itself, for in the first place the
                    air cannot transmit transverse vibrations, and the normal vibrations which the
                    air does transmit travel about a million times slower than light. Solid
                    transparent bodies, such as glass and crystals, are no doubt capable of
                    transmitting transverse vibrations, but the velocity of transmission is still
                    hundreds of thousand times less than that with which light is transmitted
                    through these bodies. We are therefore obliged to suppose that the medium
                    through which light is propagated is something distinct from the transparent
                    medium known to us, though it interpenetrates all transparent bodies and
                    probably opaque bodies too.</p>
                <p>The velocity of light, however, is different in different transparent media, and
                    we must therefore suppose that these mediatakesomepart in the process, and that
                    their particles are vibrating as well as those of the aether, but the energy of
                    the vibrations of the gross par tides must be very much smaller than that of the
                    aether, for otherwise a much larger proportion of the incident light would be
                    reflected when a ray passes from vacuum to glass or from glass to vacuum than we
                    find to be the case.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relative motion of the (Ether.—</hi> We must therefore consider
                    the aether within dense bodies as somewhat loosely connected with the dense
                    bodies, and wo have next to inquire whether, when these dense bodies are in
                    motion through the great ocean of aether, they carry along with them the aether
                    they contain, or whether the aether passes through them as the water · of the
                    sea passes through the meshes of a net when it is towed along by a boat. If it
                    were possible to determine the velocity of light by observing the time it takes
                    to travel between one station and another on the earth’s surface, we might, by
                    comparing the observed velocities in opposite directions, determine the velocity
                    of the aether with respect to these terrestrial stations. All methods, however,
                    by which it is practicable to determine the velocity of light from terrestrial
                    experiments depend on the measurement of the time required for the double
                    journey from one station to the other and back again, and the increase of this
                    time on account of a relative velocity of the aether equal to that of the earth
                    in its orbit would be only about one hundred millionth part of the whole time of
                    transmission, and would therefore be quite insensible.</p>
                <p>The theory of the motion of the aether is hardly sufficiently developed to enable
                    us to form a strict mathematical theory of the aberration of light, taking into
                    account the motion of the aether. Professor Stokes, however, has shown that, on
                    a very probable hypothesis with respect to the motion of the aether, the amount

                <p>Arago proposed to compare the deviation produced in the light of a star after
                    passing through an achromatic prism when the direction of the ray within the
                    prism formed different angles with the direction of motion of the earth in its
                    orbit. If the aether were moving swiftly through the prism, the deviation might
                    be expected tobe different when the direction of the light was the same as that
                    of the aether, and when these directions were opposite.</p>

                    the experiment in a more practicable manner by using an ordinary spectroscope,
                    in which a plane mirror was substituted for the slit of the collimator. The
                    cross wires of the observing telescope were illuminated. The lightfrom any point
                    of the wire passed through the object-glass and then through the prisms as a
                    parallel pencil till it fell on the object-glass of the collimator, and came to
                    a focus at the mirror, where it was reflected, and after passing again through
                    the object-glass it formed a pencil passing through each of the prisms parallel
                    to its original direction, so that the object-glass of the observing telescope
                    brought it to a focus coinciding with the point of the cross wires from which it
                    originally proceeded. Since the image coincided with the object, it could not be
                    observed directly, but by diverting the pencil by partial reflection at a plane
                    surface of glass, it was found that the image of the finest spider line could be
                    distinctly seen, though the light which formed the image had passed twice
                    through three prisms of 60°. The apparatus was first turned so that the
                    direction of the light in first passing through the second prism was that of the
                    earth’s motion in its orbit. The apparatus was afterwards placed so that the
                    direction of the light was opposite to that of the earth’s motion. If the
                    deviation of the ray by the prisms was increased or diminished for this reason
                    in the first journey, it would be diminished or increased in the return journey,
                    and the image would appear on one side of the object. When the apparatus was
                    turned round it would appear on the other side. The experiment was tried at
                    difierent times of the year, but only negative results were obtained. We cannot,
                    however, conclude absolutely from this experiment that the aether near the
                    surface of the earth is carried along with the earth in its orbit, for it has
                    been shown by Professor Stokes<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that according to Fresnel’s hypothesis the relative velocity of the aether
                    within the prism would be to that of the aether outside inversely as the square
                    of the index of refraction, and that in this case the deviation would not be
                    sensibly altered on account of the motion of the prism through the aether.</p>

                <p>In another experiment of M. Fizeau, which seems entitled to greater confidence,
                    he has observed that the propagation of light in a stream of water takes place
                    with greater velocity in the direction in which the water moves than in the
                    opposite direction, but that the change of velocity is less than that which
                    would be due to the actual velocity of the water, and that the phenomenon does
                    not occur when air is substituted for water. This experiment seems rather to
                    verify Fresnel’s theory of the aether; but the whole question of the state of
                    the luminiferous medium near the earth, and of its connexion with grose matter,
                    is very far as yet from being settled by experiment.</p>

                    that in the transmission of the force there is such an action, external to the
                    magnet, than that the effects are merely attraction and repulsion at a distance.
                    Such an action may be a function of the aether; for it is not unlikely that, if
                    there be an aether, it should have other uses than simply the conveyance of

                    reason to believe that the former depends on a property of the medium in virtue
                    of which an electric displacement elicits an electromotive force in the opposite
                    direction, the electromotive force for unit displacement being inversely as the

                <p>The electrokinetic energy, on the other hand, is simply the energy of the motion
                    set up in the medium by electric currents and magnets, this motion not being
                    confined to the wires which carry the currents, or to the magnet, but existing

                    the luminiferous medium, but the best way to compare them is to determine the
                    velocity with which an electromagnetic disturbance would be propagated through
                    the medium. If this should be equal to the velocity of light, we would have
                    strong reason to believe that the two media, occupying as they do the same
                    space, are really identical. The data for making the calculation are furnished
                    by the experiments made in order to compare the electromagnetic with the
                    electrostatic system of units. The velocity of propagation of an electromagnetic
                    disturbance in air, as calculated from different sets of data, does not differ
                    more from the velocity of light in air, as determined by difierent observers,
                    than the several calculated values of these quantities differ among each
                    other.</p>
                <p>If the velocity of propagation of an electromagnetic disturbance is equal to that
                    of light in other transparent media, then in non-magnetic media the specific

                <p>The undulatory theory, in the form which treats the phenomena of light as the

                    aether? is it molecular or continuous?</p>
                <p>We know that the aether transmits transverse vibrations to very great distances
                    without sensible loss of energy by dissipation. A molecular medium, moving under
                    such conditions that a group of molecules once near together remain near each
                    other during the whole motion, may be capable of transmitting vibrations without
                    much dissipation of energy, but if the motion is such that the groups of
                    molecules are not merely slightly altered in configuration but entirely broken
                    up, so that their component molecules pass into new types of grouping, then in
                    the passage from one type of grouping to another the energy of regular
                    vibrations will be frittered away into that of the irregular agitation which we
                    call heat.</p>
                <p>We cannot therefore suppose the constitution of the aether to be like that of a
                    gas, in which the molecules are always in a state of irregular agitation, for in
                    such a medium a transverse undulation is reduced to less than one five-hundredth
                    of its amplitude in a single wave-length. If the aether is molecular, the
                    grouping of the molecules must remain of the same type, the configuration of the
                    groups being only slightly altered during the motion.</p>
                <p>Mr S. Tolver Preston<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> Sept, and Nov. 1877</p></note> has supposed that
                    the aether is like a gas whose molecules very rarely interfere with each other,
                    so that their mean path is far greater than any planetary distances. He has not
                    investigated the properties of such a medium with any degree of completeness,
                    but it is easy to see that we might form a theory in which the molecules <hi
                    rend="italic">never</hi> interfere with each other’s motion of translation, but
                    travel in all directions with the velocity of light; and if we further suppose
                    that vibrating bodies have the power of impressing on these molecules some
                    vector property (such as rotation about an axis) which does not interfere with
                    their motion of translation, and which is then carried along by the molecules,
                    and if the alternation of the average value of this vector for all the molecules
                    within an element of volume be the process which we call light, then the
                    equations which express this average will be of the same form as that which
                    expresses the displacement in the ordinary theory.</p>
                <p>It is often asserted that the mere fact that a medium is elastic or compressible
                    is a proof that the medium is not continuous, but is composed of separate parts
                    having void spaces between them. But there is nothing inconsistent with
                    experience in supposing elasticity or compressibility to be properties of every
                    portion, however small, into which the medium can be conceived to be divided, in
                    which case the medium would be strictly continuous. A medium, however, though
                    homogeneous and continuous as regards its density, may be rendered heterogeneous
                    by its motion, as in Sir W. Thomson’s hypothesis of vortex-molecules in a
                    perfect liquid (see art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom).</hi></p>
                <p>The aether, if it is the medium of electromagnetic phenomena, is probably
                    molecular, at least in this sense.</p>
                <p>Sir W. Thomson<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society,</hi> June 1856.</p></note> has
                    shown that the magnetic influence on light discovered by Faraday depends on the
                    direction of motion of moving particles, and that it indicates a rotational
                    motion in the medium when magnetized. See also <hi rend="italic">Maxwell's
                    Electricity and Magnetism,</hi> art. 806, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Now, it is manifest that this rotation cannot be that of the medium as a whole
                    about an axis, for the magnetic field may be of any breadth, and there is no
                    evidence of any motion the velocity of which increases with the distance from a
                    single fixed line in the field. If there is any motion of rotation, it must be a
                    rotation of very small portions of the medium each about its own axis, so that
                    the medium must be broken up into a number of molecular vortices.</p>
                <p>We have as yet no data from which to determine the size or the number of these
                    molecular vortices. We know, however, that the magnetic force in the region in
                    the neighbourhood of a magnet is maintained as long as the steel retains its
                    magnetization, and as we have no reason to believe that a steel magnet would
                    lose all its magnetization by the mere lapse of time, we conclude that the
                    molecular vortices do not require a continual expenditure of work in order to
                    maintain their motion, and that therefore this motion does not necessarily
                    involve dissipation of energy.</p>
                <p>No theory of the constitution of the aether has yet been invented which will
                    account for such a system of molecular vortices being maintained for an
                    indefinite time without their energy being gradually dissipated into that
                    irregular agitation of the medium which, in ordinary media, is called heat.</p>
                <p>Whatever difficulties we may have in forming a consistent idea of the
                    constitution of the aether, there can be no doubt that the interplanetary and
                    interstellar spaces are not empty, but are occupied by a material substance or

                <p>Whether this vast homogeneous expanse of isotropic matter is fitted not only to
                    be a medium of physical interaction between distant bodies, and to fulfil other
                    physical functions of which, perhaps, we have as yet no conception, but also, as
                    the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Unseen Universe</hi> seem to suggest, to
                    constitute the material organism of beings exercising functions of life and mind
                    as high or higher than ours are at present, is a question far transcending the
                    limits of physical speculation. (J. c. Μ.)</p>
