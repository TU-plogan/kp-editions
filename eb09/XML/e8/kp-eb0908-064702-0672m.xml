                    narrow, is about 90 miles; its breadth varies considerably,—at the broadest part
                    it measures about 30 miles, at the narrowest not more than four. Its general
                    direction is from N.W. to S.E., and it is traversed throughout its entire length
                    by a mountain range, which forms part of the chain that bounds Thessaly on the
                    E. under the names of Ossa and Pelion, and is further continued beyond the
                    extremity of Euboea in the lofty islands of Andros, Tenos, and Myconos. The
                    principal peaks of this range, some of which attain a great elevation, group
                    themselves into three knots, in the north, the centre, and the south of the
                    island, which they thus divide with some completeness into three portions.
                    Towards the north, opposite the Locrian territory, the highest peaks are Mounts
                    Macistus (Kandili) and Telethrius, the former 3967, and the latter 3186 feet
                    above the sea. Mount Telethrius was famed in ancient times for its medicinal
                    plants, and at its foot are the celebrated hot springs, near the town of
                    Aedepsus, called the Baths of Hercules, which were used, we are told, by the
                    dictator Sulla, and have now been converted into an extensive bathing
                    establishment, though the arrangements are of a rude description. These sources,
                    which are strongly sulphurous, rise a short distance inland at several points,
                    and at last pour themselves steaming over the rocks, which they have yellowed
                    with their deposit, into the Euboic Sea. Opposite the entrance of the Maliac
                    Gulf is the promontory of Cenaeum, the highest point behind which, rising to an
                    elevation of 2221 feet, is now called Lithada, the name being a corruption of
                    Lichades, as the islands were called that lie off the extremity of the headland.
                    Here again we meet with the legends of Hercules, for this cape, together with
                    the neighbouring coast of Trachis, was the scene of the events connected with
                    the death of that hero, as described by Sophocles in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trachinioe.</hi> Near the N.E. extremity of the island, and almost facing the
                    entrance of the Gulf of Pagasae, is the promontory of Artemisium, celebrated for
                    the great naval victory gained by the Greeks over the Persians, 480 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Towards the centre, to the N.E. of Chalcis, rises the

                    May, while its sides are clothed with pines and firs, and lower down with
                    chestnuts and planes. It is one of the most conspicuous summits of eastern
                    Greece and <pb break="no"

                    projects into the Aegean. At the southern extremity the highest mountain is
                    Oche, now called St Elias, rising to the height of 4G06 feet. The south western
                    promontory was named Geraestus, the south-eastern Caphareus; the latter of these
                    was ill-famed on account of its dangers to uavigatιon, for, being an exposed
                    point, it attracts the storms, which rush between it and the neighbouring cliffs
                    of Andros as through a funnel. The whole of the eastern coast was rocky and
                    destitute of harbours, especially the part called Coela, or “the Hollows,” where
                    part of the Persian fleet was wrecked, which probably lay between the headlands
                    of Chersonesus and Caphareus. So greatly was this dreaded by sailors, that the
                    principal line of traffic from the north of the Aegean to Athens used to pass by
                    Chalcis and the Euboic Sea.</p>
                <p>Eubcea was believed to have originally formed part of the mainland, and to have
                    been separated from it by an earthquake. This is the less improbable because it
                    lies in the neighbourhood of a line of earthquake movement, and both from
                    Thucydides and Strabo we hear of the northern part of the island being shaken at
                    different periods, and the latter writer speaks of a fountain at. Chalcis being
                    dried up by a similar cause, and a mud volcano formed in the neighbouring plain.
                    Evidences of volcanic action are also trace able in the legends connected with
                    Hercules at Aedepsus and Cenaeum, which here, as at Lemnos and elsewhere in
                    Greece, have that origin. Its northern extremity is separated from the
                    Thessalian coast by a strait, which at one point is not more than a mile and a
                    half in width. From the promontory of Cenaeum southwards for about fifteen miles
                    the depth of the channel is so great that half a mile from the shore no bottom
                    has been found with 220 fathoms of line; the water, however, gradually shoals
                    from this point to Chalcis. In the neighbourhood of that town, both to the north
                    and south, the bays are so confined as readily to explain the story of
                    Agamemnon’s fleet having been detained there by contrary winds. At Chalcis
                    itself the strait, assuming the name of Euripus, contracts to a breadth of not
                    more than 120 feet, and is divided in the middle by a rock, on which now stands
                    a castle. The channel towards Boeotia is spanned by a stone bridge, that towards
                    Chalcis by one of wood; the latter is by far the deeper channel. The
                    extraordinary changes of tide which take place in this passage have been a
                    subject of wonder from classical times to the present day, and are not yet
                    explained. As you stand on the bridge you will see the current running like a
                    river in one direction, and shortly afterwards it will be running with equal
                    velocity in the other. Strabo speaks of them as varying seven times in the day,
                    but it is more accurate to say, with Livy, that they are irregular. They are
                    referred to in several passages of the Attic tragedians. A bridge was first
                    constructed here in the twenty-first year of the Peloponnesian war, when Euboea
                    revolted from Athens; and thus the Bceotians, whose work it was, contrived to
                    make that country “an island to every one but themselves.” Hence Ephorus
                    remarked that nature might almost be said to have made that island part of
                    Boeotia, lhe Bceotians by this means secured a powerful weapon of offence
                    against Athens, being able to impede their supplies of gold and corn from
                    Thrace, of timber from Macedonia, and of horses from Thessaly, for, as has been
                    already said, their traffic from the north used to pass by this way. The name
                    Euripus was corrupted during the Middle Ages into Evripo and Egripo, and in this
                    latter form transferred to the whole island, whence the Venetians, when they
                    occupied the district, altered it to Negroponte^ with reference to the bridge
                    which connected it with the mainland.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Eubcea are few in number and scanty in volume, as is natural in a
                    rocky island, where they have so short a distance to run. In the north-eastern
                    portion the Budorus flows into the Aegean, being formed by two streams which
                    unite their waters in a small plain, and were perhaps the Cereus and Neleus
                    concerning which the story was told that sheep drinking the water of the one
                    became white, of the other black. On the north coast, near Histiaea, is the
                    Callas; and on the western side the Lelantus, near Chalcis, flowing through the
                    plain of the same name. This plain, which intervenes between Chalcis and
                    Eretria, and was a fruitful source of contention to those cities, is the most
                    considerable of the few and small spaces of level ground in the island, and was
                    fertile in corn. Aristotle, when speaking of the aristocratic character of the
                    horse, as requiring fertile soil for its support, and consequently being
                    associated with wealth, instances its use among the Chalcidιans and Eretrians,
                    and in the former of those two states we find a class of nobles called
                    Hippobotae. This rich district was afterwards occupied by Athenian cleruchs. The
                    next largest plain was that of Histiaea, and at the present day this and the
                    neighbourhood of the Budorus (Achmet-Aga) are the two best cultivated parts of
                    Euboea, owing to the exertions of foreign colonists The mountains afford
                    excellent pasturage for sheep and cattle, which were reared in great quantities
                    in ancient times, and seem to have given the island its name; these pastures
                    belonged to the state. The forests are extensive and fine, and are now
                    superintended by Government officials, called <hi rend="italic">δασοφύλακα,</hi>
                    in spite or with the connivance of whom the timber is being rapidly
                    destroyed—partly from the merciless way in which it is cut by the proprietors,
                    partly from its being burnt by the shepherds, for the sake of the beautiful
                    grass that springs up after such conflagrations, and partly owing to the goats,
                    whose bite kills all the young growths. In the mountains were several valuable
                    mines of iron and copper; and from Carystus, at the south of the island, came
                    the green and white marble, the modern Cipollmo, which was in great request
                    among the Romans of the imperial period for architectural purposes, and the
                    quaιries of which belonged to the emperor. The scenery of Eubcea is perhaps the
                    most beautiful in Greece, owing to the varied combinations of rock, wood, and
                    water; for from the uplands the sea is almost always in view, either the wide
                    island-studded expanse of the Aegean, or the succession of lakes formed by the
                    Euboic Sea, together with mountains of exquisite outline, while the valleys and
                    maritime plains are clothed either with fruit trees or with plane trees of
                    magnificent growth. On the other hand, no part of Greece is so destitute of
                    interesting remains of antiquity.</p>
                <p>Like most of the Greek islands, Eubcea was originally known under other names,
                    such as Macris and Doliche from its shape, and Ellopia and Abantis from the
                    tribes inhabiting it. The races by which it was occupied at an early period were
                    different in the three districts, into which, as we have seen, it was naturally
                    divided. In the northern portion we find the Histiaei and Ellopes, Thessalian
                    races, which probably had passed over from the Pagasaean Gulf. In central Euboea
                    were the Curetes and Abantes, who seem to have come from the neighbouring
                    continent by way of the Euripus; of these the Abantes, after being reinforced by
                    Ionians from Attica, rose to great power, and exercised a sort of supremacy over
                    the whole island, so that in Homer the inhabitants generally are called by that
                    name. The southern part was occupied by the Dryopes, part of which tribe, after
                    having been expelled from their original seats in the south of Thessaly by the
                    Dorians, migrated to this, island, and established themselves in the three
                    cities of Carystus, Dystus, and Styra. The name of the last-men·</p>

                <p>tioned place, however, gives evidence of a previous Phoenician settlement, for it
                    is a corruption of Astarte, which is found in the form Astyra at several p laces
                    on the coasts of the Aegean. The Phoenicians were attracted hither, as they were
                    to other points on the shores of Greece, by the purplemussel, which was obtained
                    in the Euboic Sea. The population at the present day is made up of elements not
                    less various, for many of the Greek inhabitants seem from their costumes to have
                    immigrated, partly from the mainland, and partly from other islands; and besides
                    these, the southern portion is occupied by Albanians, who probably have come
                    from Andro3j in the mountain districts nomad Wallach shepherds are found; and at
                    Chalcis there are a certain number of Turkish and Jewish families, who live
                    quietly with the other inhabitants, and are not molested.</p>
                <p>The history of the island is for the most part that of its two principal cities,
                    Chalcis and Eretria, the latter of which was situated about 15 miles S.E. of the
                    former, and was also on the shore of the Euboic Sea. The neighbourhood of the
                    fertile Lelantian plain, and their proximity to the place of passage to the
                    mainland, were evidently the causes of the choice of site, as well as of their
                    prosperity. Both cities were Ionian settlements from Attica, and their
                    importance in early times is shown by their numerous colonies in Magna Graecia
                    and Sicily, and such as Cumae, Rhegium, and Naxos, and on the coast of
                    Macedonia, the projecting portion of which, with its three peninsulas, hence
                    obtained the name of Chalcidice. In this way they opened new trade routes to the
                    Greeks, and extended the field of civilization. How great their commerce was is
                    shown by the fact that the Euboic scale of weights and measures was in use at
                    Athens and among the Ionic cities generally. They were rival cities, and at
                    first appear to have been e ∣ually powerful; one of the earliest of the
                    sea-fights mentioned in Greek history took place between them, and in this we
                    are told that many of the other Greek states took part. It was in consequence of
                    the aid which the people of Miletus lent to the Eretrians on this occasion that
                    Eretria sent five ships to aid the Iomans in their revolt against the Persians;
                    and owing to this, that city was the first place in Greece Proper to be attacked
                    by Datis and Artaphernes in 490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It was utterly
                    ruined on that occasion, and its inhabitants were transported to Persia. Though
                    it was restored after the battle of Marathon, on a site at a little distance
                    from its original position, it never regaiued its former eminence, but it was
                    still the second city in the island. From this time its neighbour Chalcis,
                    which, though it suffered from a lack of good water, was, as Strabo says, the
                    natural capital from its commanding the Euripus, held an undisputed supremacy.
                    Already, however, this city had suffered from the growing power of Athens. In
                    the year 506, when the Chalcidians joined with the Boeotians and the Spartan
                    king Cleomenes in a league against that state, they were totally defeated by the
                    Athenians, who established 4000 Attic colonists on their lands, and seem to have
                    reduced the whole island to a condition of dependence. Again, in 446, when
                    Euboea endeavoured to throw off the yoke, it was once more reduced by Pericles,
                    and a new body of settlers was planted at Histi&lt;ea in the north of the
                    island, after the inhabitants of that toλvn had been expelled. This event is
                    referred to by Aristophanes in the <hi rend="italic">Clouds</hi> (212), where
                    the old farmer, on being shown Euboea on the map “lying outstretched in all its
                    length,” remarks,—“I know; we laid it prostrate under Pericles.” The Athenians
                    fully recognized its importance to them, both as supplying them with corn and
                    cattle, as securing their commerce, and as guaranteeing them against piracy, for
                    its proximity to the coast of Attica rendeκed it extremely dangerous to them
                    when in other hands, so that Demosthenes, in the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Corona,</hi> speaks of a time when the pirates that made it their headquarters
                    so infested the neighbouring sea as to prevent all navigation. But in the 21st
                    year of the Peloponnesian war the island succeeded in regaining its
                    independence. After this, we find it taking sides with one or other of the
                    leading states, until, after the battle of Chaeronea, it passed into the hands
                    of Philip, and finally into those of the Romans. By the great Demetrius
                    Poliorcetes, Chalcis was called one of the three fetters of Greece, Demetrias on
                    the Gulf of Pagasa* and Corinth being the other two.</p>
                <p>In modern history Euboea or Negropont comes once more prominently into notice at
                    the time of the fourth crusade. In the partition of the Eastern empire by the
                    Latins which followed that event, the island was divided into three fiefs, the
                    occupants of which ere long found it expedient to place themselves under the
                    protection of the Venetian republic, which thenceforward became the sovereign
                    power in the country. For more than two centuries and a half during which they
                    remained in possession, it was one of the most valuable of their dependencies,
                    and the lion of St Mark may still be seen, both over the sea gate of Chalcis
                    (Negropont), and in other parts of the town. At length in 1470, after a valiant
                    defence, this well-fortified city wa·r wrested from them by Mohammed IL, and the
                    whole island fell into the hands of the Turks. One desperate attempt to regain
                    it was made by Morosini in 1688, when the city was besieged by land and sea for
                    three months; but owing to the strength of the place, and the disease which
                    thinned their ranks, the assailants were forced to withdraw. At the conclusion
                    of the Greek War of Independence, in 1830, the island was delivered from the
                    Turkish sway, and constituted a part of the newly established Greek state. The
                    present population of Chalcis is about 5000 souls. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h. f.
