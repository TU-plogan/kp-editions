                <p><label type="entry">EUCLID</label>, of Megara, a Greek philosopher, the founder
                    of the Megarian school, was born in the latter half of the 5th century B.c.,
                    probably at Megara, though Gela in Sicily has also been named as his
                    birth-place. He was one of the most devoted of the disciples of Socrates. If we
                    may believe Aulus Gellius, such was his enthusiasm that, when a decree was
                    passed forbidding the Megarians to enter Athens, he regularly visited his master
                    by night in the disguise of a woman; and he was one of the little band of
                    intimate friends who had the privilege of listening to the hero’s last
                    discourse. After his master’s death, he withdrew, with a number of his
                    fellow-disciples, to Megara; and it has been conjectured, though there is no
                    direct evidence, that this was the period of Plato’s residence in Megara, of
                    which indications appear in the <hi rend="italic">Thecetetus.</hi> The
                    fundamental principle of Euclid’s philosophy was a combination of the Eleatic
                    conception of Being—the One and All, and the Socratic conception of the Good.
                    Being is immaterial and unchangeable, and is identical with the Good, which is
                    the same as God, as Reason, and (following the Socratic doctrine) as Wisdom, and
                    which alone truly exists. . Thus the existence of evil was denied; and the main
                    object of the Megarian, as it was of the Eleatic dialectic, was to prove <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"

                    becoming, motion, and possibility to be self-contradictory and false. With
                    Plato, Euclid taught that sense has cognizance of the changeable and unreal
                    only, while thought penetrates to unchangeable Being, to the Good. The Megarian
                    school prided itself first of all upon its dialectic. Euclid’s dialectic
                    differed greatly from that of his master Socrates, in marked contrast to whom he
                    repudiated the principle of analogical reasoning as unsound. His favourite
                    method of attacking an opponent was by the <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdum,</hi> which was also a
                    favourite method with his followers, whose arguments degenerated into trivial
                    sophisms, which laid them frequently open to an attack with their own weapon,
                    and which earned for them the contemptuous name of the ’Εριστικοί or
                    “wranglers.” Of Euclid’s followers the chief were Eubulides, who taught
                    Demosthenes, wrote against Aristotle, and invented several trilling but
                    ingenious paradoxes, of which the most famous is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sorites;</hi> Diodorus Chronus, the author of certain arguments to prove
                    the impossibility of motion; Philo; and, most famous of all, Stilpo, who was
                    distinguished by the attractiveness of his lectures.</p>
                <p>Oιιr knowledge of Euclid’s philosophy is borrowed from scattered passages in
                    Plato, and from Diogenes Laertius. See Zeller, <hi rend="italic">Socrates and,
