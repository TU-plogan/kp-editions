                    really means a limited succession—one cut out by the will of the maker of the
                    entail from the ordinary legal course .of succession. The derivation of the word
                    from <hi rend="italic">talis</hi> (tales haeredes qui in tenore investiturae
                    contineantur) is now abandoned. But, as an existing social institution, entail
                    has also generally involved more or less restriction on the proprietary powers
                    of the heirs succeeding to the subject of entail. The policy of entails has
                    therefore been keenly discussed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    London, 1848.</p></note> The attempt to settle the matter on legal principles
                    entirely failed. On the one hand, in the language of the civil law, <hi

                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">arbiter.</hi> This was said to imply an
                    unlimited right to dictate the conditions on which an estate was to be enjoyed
                    after the death of its owner. On the other hand, it was argued that on death the
                    ownership must change, and that the restrictions imposed on heirs of entail
                    wereinconsiβtent with the nature of property. These legal conceptions are
                    themselves merely the products of different states of society. A powerful and
                    learned writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. de
                    Laveleye, in his <hi rend="italic">De la Propriété et de ses formes
                    primitives,</hi> Paris, 1874.</p></note> has recently shown that the notion of
                    absolute and exclusive private property is of quite modern date; and it may be
                    added that the power of testamentary disposition was unknown in primitive times,
                    and has only been very gradually admitted. In most civilized countries, so far
                    as concerns the creation of perpetuities, it is now being curtailed in obedience
                    to those considerations of social expediency which alone can decide the question
                    of entails. Conservative philosophers have maintained that the hope of founding
                    a family and an estate which will together be immortal is so great an incentive
                    to the higher forms of industry that the state cannot afford to do without it.
                    But the irresistible answer is that if you give this powerful motive to the
                    founder of a perpetuity, you take it away from every succeeding generation of
                    his descendants.. They are born to wealth which their idleness will not
                    dissipate, and possibly to social distinction which has not been earned by their
                    exertions. Besides, it is not disputed that perpetuities are opposed to the
                    interest of the state in the annual produce of the soil, which they place <hi

                    rend="italic">Works</hi> (Spedding’s ed.), vii. 490.</p></note> —“Children grew
                    disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside; farmers were ousted of
                    their leases made by tenants in tail; for, if such leases had been valid, then
                    under colour of long leases the issue might have been virtually disinherited;
                    creditors were defrauded of their debts; for if tenant in tail could have
                    charged his estate with their payment, he might have also defeated his issue by
                    mortgaging it for as much as it was worth; innumerable latent entails were
                    produced to deprive purchasers of the land they had fairly bought—of suits in
                    consequence of which our ancient books are full; and treasons were encouraged—as
                    estates-tail were not liable to forfeiture longer than for the tenant’s life.”
                    It is, indeed, obvious that, even if we assume heirs of entail as a class to
                    have been keenly alive to the duties or the true interests of ownership, they
                    had no power to improve their estates or to assist their tenants in doing so.
                    But even if entailed estates were managed so as to yield the greatest possible
                    amount of produce, it would still be a misfortune, and a complete answer to the
                    argument we have been considering, that the land, so far as entailed, would be
                    beyond the most ambitious hopes of the mercantile and manufacturing community.
                    Perpetuities have, however, been defended on the perfectly distinct principle,
                    not economical (in the narrower sense), but broadly political, that they are
                    essential to the permanent well-being of an aristocracy. It is impossible here
                    to discuss the advantages resulting from the existence of an aristocratic caste,
                    whether invested with the hereditary privilege of legislation or regarded merely
                    as contributing to political life an element of safety and independence and
                    culture and historical continuity. These advantages, if they be facts, do not
                    seem to be necessarily connected with any particular system of land-laws, and in
                    certain circumstances a system of perpetuities might possibly impoverish and
                    degrade a real aristocracy. But it is certainly true that in the past the two
                    institutions are found in very close connection. Perhaps, in this view, the
                    earliest type of an entail occurs when, out of the common property of a tribe or
                    other primitive organization, some lands are given to a family who hold a public
                    office or exercise definite hereditary functions. In later times the connection
                    is sufficiently illustrated by the Carlovingian institution of τnq∕orα&lt;MS,
                    which spread through France and Italy and Spain, and which, like so many other
                    Carlovingian ideas, was reproduced by Napoleon in the tawdry magnificence of the
                    imperial decrees of 1808.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Hence, also, the various suggestions which have been made of a downward and an
                    upward limit to the property which should be required for a lawful entail of
                    certain dignities. In his essay on <hi rend="italic">Popular Discontents</hi>
                    Sir William Temple proposed, and Dr Johnson applauded the proposal, that every
                    baron should have at least £4000, every earl £6000, and every duke £8000 worth
                    of land. This idea has frequently been realized in practice. In Prussia an
                    entail was incompetent except of subjects above £400 in net annual value; in
                    Denmark the estate must be at least 200 fonder of hard corn, or 2000 acres in
                    extent; and under the Napoleonic system the <hi rend="italic">dotation</hi> of
                    the proposed entail, whether proceeding from the Government or from the
                    applicant himself, was always carefully fixed by the <hi rend="italic">Conseil
                    du sceau</hi><hi rend="italic">des titres,</hi> with reference to the title or
                    dignity which it was intended to preserve. A prince of the imperial blood or a
                    grand dignitary was entitled to call his house a <hi rend="italic">palais,</hi>
                    princes of the empire and dukes had to content themselves with <hi rend="italic"
                    >hotel,</hi> and so on. The same principle appears in the canon of construction
                    laid down by the old Italian law, that a majoratus of such subjects as palatium,
                    turris, castrum, and even aedificium was easily presumed.<note anchored="true"

                    law of entail has supplied the key to more than one political situation. Such
                    was the great controversy “de vanitate haeredum regre-dientium,” whether
                    according to the doctrine of reversion or <hi rend="italic"
                    >regredient-erbeη,</hi> on the failure of heirs male, and in the absence of any
                    <hi rend="italic">pactum confraternitatis</hi> taking the estate to another
                    family, a fee-simple estate remained in the last substitute, or whether the
                    estate returned to the heirs of the entail. This question arose in 1740 between
                    Maria Theresa and the elector of Bavaria; the former was victorious by force of
                    arms against the general opinion of lawyers. It was also discussed all over
                    Europe in the Hochsteden case. The crown of Spain was the type of the regular
                    mayorazgo in that country—the inalienable estates descending to the eldest and
                    nearest heir by blood (natu major), with right of representation and without
                    preference of males. Again, the relation between the crown and the entailed
                    estates of subjects has produced a number of elaborate rules with respect to the
                    <hi rend="italic">justoe causoe</hi> of interference by the state, and has thus
                    profoundly influenced the history of Europe. An Italian majoratus, for instance,
                    might include such subjects as ju3 honorificum, patronatus, commenda militaris,
                    feudum habens administrationem: from all these monks were by the common law
                    excluded; and all of them were forfeited to the fisc, either absolutely or for a
                    time, by the blasphemy, heresy, or treason of the heir in possession. The
                    entail, therefore, has always been much more than a family settlement or a
                    system of land tenure. In modern Europe there have not been many forms of
                    hereditary aristocracy without some form of entail. But it by no means follows
                    that the influence of perpetuities upon the aristocracy has been beneficial. The
                    introduction of <hi rend="italic">post obit</hi> bonds, and the law of England
                    relating to the protection of infants against unconscionable bargains, suggest
                    some reflections of a different kind. It will appear in this article that public
                    opinion has generally condemned entails, and that they are being rapidly
                    abolished throughout Europe.</p>
                <p>The speeches of Isaeus and Demosthenes show that in</p>
                <p>Greece many difficult questions had risen with regard to the power of a testator
                    to substitute one heir after another; but the earliest definite legal forms of
                    entail were those which appeared under the later Roman law relating to <hi
                    rend="italic">fidei commissa,</hi> or trusts. The fidei commissum was originally
                    a trust conveyance introduced for the purpose of evading such disabilities as
                    the lex Voconia imposed on women to take directly under a will. The trustee, or
                    <hi rend="italic">fiduciarius,</hi> was after the time of Augustus liable in a
                    personal action at the instance of the beneficiary, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hoeres</hi><hi rend="italic">fiduciamus.</hi> This form, however, was soon
                    converted into a long nomination or substitution of heirs, to which clauses
                    prohibiting alienation were added. The most common clauses were such as “ne eum
                    fundum vendatis,” “ne ex nomine familiae alienaretur.” One well-known form also
                    prohibited mortgages, and emphatically declared that the settled estates should
                    remain “firmas meis filiis et nepotibus <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">universum</hi><hi rend="italic">ternpusf</hi> and that all
                    contrary deeds should be void and null. On this deed Scaevola expressed the
                    opinion that a security over the rents was not a contravention.<note

                    could not alienate without the superior’s consent, because on the failure of
                    these heirs the feu returned to the superior. Indeed, the vassal could not alter
                    the succession; and hence, as Sir Thomas Craig observes, “sine superioris
                    consensu vixtalliae locus esse potest.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of limitation is here of course entirely opposed to that of the Roman law, which
                    affirmed the right of a testator to name his heirs in perpetuity. It was a
                    feudal maxim, “Solus Deus potest facere haeredem;”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mr Charles Butler’s note 191a to <hi

                    vassal’s right arose, not from his own act, but from the reserved estate of
                    superiority and the tenor of his charter in the lands. The feudal law also
                    favoured male heirs, and required that one heir only should succeed.</p>
                <p>It appears from the laws of Alfred (c. 37), that entails were known before the
                    Norman feudal law had been domesticated in England. “Si quis terram
                    haereditariam habeat, eam von vendat a cognatis haeredibus suis, si illi viro
                    prohibitum sit, qui eam ab initio acquisivit, ut ita facere nequeat.” These
                    grants which could not be alienated from the linea&lt;re of the first purchaser
                    were also known as <pb break="no"

                    if the donee had no heirs of his body the estate reverted to the donor. This
                    right of reversion being constantly evaded by a sale and repurchase on the birth
                    of issue, the famous Statute of Westminster the Second, <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">donis</hi><hi rend="italic">conditionalibus,</hi> 13
                    Edw. I. c. 1, was passed, which provided that the will of the donor should be
                    observed, and that no alienation by the donee should prevent the operation of
                    the condition. Thus was created the fee-tail, or <hi rend="italic">feudum
                    talliatum,</hi> of English law—a strict and practically perpetual entail. The
                    power of alienation was reintroduced by the judges in Taltarum’s case (Year
                    Book, 12 Edw. IV. 19) by means of a fictitious suit or recovery which had
                    originally been devised by the regular clergy for evading the statutes of
                    mortmain. A full account of the mysteries of praecipe and vouching, and of
                    another fictitious process of fine (finalis concordia) and proclamation, will be
                    found in Blackstone, ii. 7, and Mr Knowler’s argument in Taylor and Horde, 1
                    Burr. 60. These forms were abolished by an Act passed in 1833; and now every
                    tenant in tail, at least while there is a possibility of issue, may bar even his
                    issue by executing a deed and enrolling it in the Court of Chancery, but not by
                    will. This right is available to creditors. The erroneous notion of <hi
                    rend="italic">heir land,</hi> however,—of something which must perpetually
                    descend from father to son,—still lingers in some country districts of England.
                    By the common form of marriage settlement, the eldest son and the other sons of
                    the marriage are made tenants in tail. Where the parent or some other person
                    enjoys a life interest under the settlement, he is called the protector of the
                    settlement, and his consent is required to the barring of the entail by the
                    first tenant in tail. Thus, except in the case of estates tail granted by the
                    crown as a reward for public services (see 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 20), land in
                    England cannot now be tied up for a longer period than the livee of persons in
                    existence and twenty-one years thereafter. The rigid law of forfeiture which was
                    applied in the time of Henry VIII. to estates tail was repealed by the Act 33
                    and 34 Vict. c. 23, which provides that no conviction of treason or felony or
                    verdict of <hi rend="italic">felo de se</hi> shall cause any attainder or
                    corruption of blood or any forfeiture or escheat.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, where for several centuries feus remained inalienable beyond

                    very late, statutory authority was not given to entails until the year
                    1685.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>^^Dalrymple’s <hi

                    “the honour of the country standeth more by ancient families than by merchants.”
                    The word entail, indeed, is often used before the 15th century, but generally in
                    the sense of a simple destination alterable by every heir in possession. Thus
                    Sir James Balfour informs us that “infefment of tailzie” is considered lawful
                    and not prejudicial to the king’s soul and conscience, and explains that the
                    entail might at any time be broken by resignation in favour of heirs whomsoever.
                    The earliest prohibition <hi rend="italic">de non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >alienando</hi> occurs in 1489. After this it was attempted to protect the
                    rights of substitute heirs by the diligences of inhibition and interdiction; and
                    at last, in the early part of the 17th century, Sir Thomas Hope, who revised the
                    Calderwood entail, introduced the well-known irritant and resolutive clauses,
                    declaring void deeds in contravention of the entail and the right of the
                    contravening heir. Cromwell, with his usual sagacity, appointed a committee to
                    consider the legal destruction of entails; but in the celebrated Stormonth case
                    in 1662, one of the clauses just mentioned was held to be valid at com mon law
                    against creditors, who, however, had got notice of it from the title-deeds. Much
                    doubt was felt about the soundness of this decision. The first Roxburgh entail
                    had been addressed to the sovereign, as if to invoke special protection. The
                    aristocracy were alarmed by the forfeitures for treason which took place under
                    Lauderdale’s administration; and accordingly the statute of 1685 was passed,
                    which until · 1848 remained the <hi rend="italic">foundation</hi> of the Scotch
                    law of entail. It adopts the style suggested by Hope (a prohibition of sales,
                    mortgages, and alterations of succession, with irritant and resolutive clauses),
                    and provides that if the deed of entail be recorded in the register of tailzies,
                    and if notice of the conditions be also given in the titles of the estate, the
                    entail is to have perpetual validity. The heir in possession remained nominally
                    proprietor, but his powers of management were in reality not much more extensive
                    than those of a liferenter. The statute applied to almost everything in the
                    nature of a heritable subject. Jedburgh cross, for instance, was entailed; so
                    was the office of heritable usher; even the smallest properties <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> a lodging in Edinburgh, <hi rend="italic">pars
                    tenementi</hi> in Forfar, a single field in the Haughs of Clyde) were sometimes
                    tied up. But it did not apply to the entails of money and household furniture,
                    which had not been uncommon in earlier times. It has been well described as a
                    “padlock on the plough;” and the security from forfeiture (except of the
                    life-interest of the traitor) which the Scotch Estates fancied they had secured
                    by the Act 1690 c. 33 was taken away by the Act 1708, c. 21, which attempted to
                    assimilate the laws relating to treason in the two countries. The feudal maxim
                    “tantum facit quis delinquendo quantum alienando” may have made rebellion more
                    stubborn; but it is impossible not to agree with the Scotch statute, that “it is
                    just that every man suffer for his own fault, and not the innocent with or for
                    the guilty.” The English law of forfeiture, on the other hand, proceeds on the
                    Ciceronian principle “ut caritas liberorum amiciores parentes reipublicae
                    redderet” <hi rend="italic">(Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Brutum,</hi> 12).<note

                    an English entail were those of remainder-men; but as a Scotch entail has no
                    remainder-men, the forfeiture of Scotch estates was for a time complete. The
                    judges and the commissioners of forfeited estates took very different and very
                    warm views of the matter. After the first Jacobite rebellion, however, a
                    compromise was effected in the case of Gordon of Park, according to which only
                    the right of the traitor’s issue was taken away. Meanwhile the entail system was
                    found to weigh heavily on agriculture; the amount of litigation to assert or to
                    control the rights of the proprietors was excessive; the judges, chiefly members
                    of the aristocratic class, at first benignant towards perpetuities, had begun to
                    apply those strict tests of language an distinguished from intention which have
                    since furnished some of the most ludicrous and not the most creditable efforts
                    of judicial interpretation; and at last, through the efforts of the Faculty of
                    Advocates led by Mr Lockhart, the Montgomery Act (10 Geo. III. c. 51) was
                    passed, which gave some relief to heirs in possession in such matters as
                    building and improving leases, expenditure on permanent improvements, and
                    exchanges. It vjas followed after a long interval by the Aberdeen Act (5 Geo.
                    IV. c. 87), which conferred powers of charging provisions to a limited amount
                    for husbands, wives, and children; and after a select committee of the Commons
                    had reported on the subject of Scotch entail (Par. Pap. vii. 1828), by the
                    Rosebery Act (6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 42, amended by 1 and 2 Vict. c. 70, and 4 and
                    5 Vict. c. 24), which enlarged <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0472-0453"/> the powers of excambion, or exchange. The
                    suggestion made in 1827 to throw entailed estates into judicial management by an
                    action of cognition and sale was fortunately abandoned. In 1840 an Act (3 and 4
                    Vict. c. 48) permitted the granting of sites for churches, schools, manses, and
                    teachers’ houses. At last, an accomplished lawyer, Lord Rutherfurd, framed and
                    passed the comprehensive Act, 11 and 12 Vict. c. 36, which still bears his name,
                    and which has abolished perpetuities in Scotland and introduced a system of
                    greater freedom than that of strict settlement in England. This Act not only
                    increases the power of charging entailed estates with improvement debts and
                    provisions, of feuing, and of sale to pay off debt, but it introduces a right to
                    disentail to be exercised for some time after the passing of the Act with
                    certain consents, but which practically gives an estate in fee-simple to every
                    entailed proprietor born after 1848. This Act, which also applies for the first
                    time the principle of the Thellusson Act to land in Scotland, has been usefully
                    enlarged by the following Acts—16 and 17 Vict. c. 94, 31 and 32 Vict. c. 84, and
                    38 and 39 Vict. c. 61,—the last of which contains a liberal definition of
                    permanent improvements. In 1847 it was estimated that one-half of the land in
                    Scotland was under entail; in 1827 the proportion was stated at one-third, the
                    number of separate entails being about 1600. Since 1848, 616 deeds of entail,
                    including reentails, 435 instruments of disentail, and 105 deeds of excambion

                <p>From a very early time the Roman law of entail, or “substitution graduelle,” was
                    received in France. The very phrase of the digest, “ne de nomine exiret,” was in
                    common use. <hi rend="italic">Insinuation,</hi> or recording in the books of a

                    his wife. In 1747 the Chancellor D’Aguesseau, after collecting the opinions of
                    all the local parliaments on the subject, passed the Ordonnances of Orléans and
                    Moulin, which prohibited perpetual substitutions, but permitted them for two
                    degrees (see <hi rend="italic">Questions</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Fidei-commissaire” in Merlin, xiii. 67). Substitutions of every kind were
                    abolished by section 896 of the Code Napoléon, but at the same time, as was
                    explained above, the emperor attempted to revive the system of majorats, or
                    entails of subsidized dignities. He says his object is “non seulement d’entourer
                    notre trône de la splendeur qui convient à sa dignité, mais encore, de nourrir
                    au coeur de nos sujets une louable émulation, en perpétuant d’illustres
                    souvenirs, et en conservant aux âges futurs l’image toujours présente des
                    récompenses qui sous un gouvernement juste suivent les grands services rendus à
                    l’etat” (Imperial Decree of 1st March 1808). All the dukes, barons, counts, and
                    chevaliers, and the others who obtained majorats, had to make the following oath
                    :—“Je jure d’être fidèle à l’empereur et à sa dynastie, d’obéir aux
                    constitutions, lois, et règlemens de l’empire, de servir sa majesté en bon,
                    loyal, et fidèle sujet, et d’élever mes enfans dans les memes sentimens de
                    fidélité et d’obéissance, et de marcher à la défense de la patrie toutes les
                    fois que le territoire sera menacé, ou que sa majesté irait à l’armée.”</p>
                <p>The estates of these majorats were subject to inspection by <hi rend="italic"
                    >agents conservateurs.</hi> The mansion-house was to be at least 2 per cent, of
                    the value of the estate. The later French laws relating to substitutions are
                    those of 12th May 1835, prohibiting all future substitutions, and 7th May
                    1849.</p>
                <p>It has already been pointed out that the Spanish crown was a majorat, subject to
                    the quaint condition, <hi rend="italic">seyendo home para ello,</hi> that the
                    heir should be a fit and proper person. The inalienability of the domain of the
                    sovereign (except to provide an apanage for the younger members of the reigning
                    family) and of the greater peers was almost part of the common law of Europe
                    (Sande, <hi rend="italic">De proh. rer. alien.)</hi> But in Spain there was än
                    unusual complexity of entails,—regular and irregular, substantial and habitual,
                    &lt;tc., varying with the elements of linea, gradus, sexus, and aetas. The <hi

                    Tais resembles the patron of an Italian majorat. Sir Geo. Mackenzie mentions

                    with lands, the consent of the crown was required to the creation of a majorat.
                    The principle of succession was that at every devolution the nearest heir to the
                    original testator should be selected (proximitas gravantis non gravati).<note

                    phrase “quia volo ut bona mea remaneant in familia mea” seem to have become
                    words of style.</p>
                <p>In Portugal the <hi rend="italic">prasos de vita,</hi> or inalienable right of
                    primogeniture for three generations, was abolished by the Act of 19th May
                    1863.</p>
                <p>Denmark still retains much more perfect entails. There the <hi rend="italic"
                    >soedegaard,</hi> or family seat, including the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hovedgaard,</hi> or manorial demesne, and the <hi rend="italic">bonder
                    gods,</hi> or portion occupied by small farmers, is frequently entailed either
                    as (1) the sàmAwsô, a perpetual entail of both heritable and movable estate,
                    which the crown sometimes graciously allows to be converted into money trusts,
                    or (2) the 32 baronial fiefs all created since the establishment of absolute
                    government in 1660, and which on failure of heirs revert to the crown.<note

                    without· powers of sale or mortgage.</p></note> Ever since the teaching of the
                    economist Pontoppidan, followed up by the practical efforts of Bernstorff and
                    Struensee, and in the present century by the agitation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bondevenner,</hi> or Radical Left of the Rigsdag, there has been a tendency to
                    bring land more completely into commerce. The constitution of 1849, indeed,
                    prohibits the creation of new entails. By Bishop Mourad’s bill of 1861, drawn by
                    the jurist Larsen, the powers of selling the entailed bonder gaarde were
                    extended much beyond the principles of <hi rend="italic">foestetvang,</hi> or
                    obligation to lease for two lives. Count Frijs and the landowners’ party then
                    began the voluntary conversion of the tene-mented farms into freeholds; and in
                    1869 Hansen carried his expropriation bill, which prohibits new estates for
                    life, and provides a machinery for compensation at the expiry of existing
                    interests. In Sweden, although primogeniture and eyen favour to male issue is
                    unknown, there are still entails, although no new ones can be created.</p>

                <p>The old hereditary male fiefs, sanjak or beglik, <hi rend="italic">ziainet</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">timars,</hi> originally granted by the Ottoman rulers,
                    have now entirely disappeared. These grants were indivisible and inviolable, and
                    formed a species of Government entail. The possessor of the beglik was in the
                    Turkish-speaking provinces called dere-beg, lord of the valley; in the Arab
                    districts <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Syria and Irak) he was called ameer, or
                    governor. The <hi rend="italic">eraziye mirige,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >imlak</hi> (crown) lands, held from the crown, still require public authority
                    for most acts of full ownership. (See the law of 7th Ramazan 1274, or 19th April
                    1857, which, slightly modified, forms at present the code of land-title in
                    Turkey in Europe.) It is a fundamental principle of Mahometan law that all land
                    belongs to the sultan as the gift of God, and is therefore to be used
                    justly.</p>
                <p>The land-legislation of Prussia during the present century is so often quoted
                    that this sketch would not be complete without some reference to its provisions
                    on the subject of entails. By the 5th clause of the edict of October 9, 1807,
                    the practice of settling estates by hereditary leases (afterwards abolished) was
                    continued · while the 9th clause provided that feudal entails and <hi
                    rend="italic">fidei commissa</hi> might be unsettled by family agreement. The
                    Prussian <hi rend="italic">fidei commissum</hi> may be constituted in every
                    object of property yielding annual returns without waste of substance; and so an
                    entail of certain movables is competent. The Prussian tenant for life can let on
                    lease, and charge the land with annuities for his daughters, and can
                    gratuitously dispose of his life-interest. The Hessian law compels him to charge
                    the fee with provisions to his younger sons. The sale of useless land has always
                    been permitted, but otherwise a public Act of expropriation must be got, or a
                    decision of the whole family council. Two next heirs in remainder may, however,
                    by their consent give effect to an exchange. The charges to which a <hi
                    rend="italic">fidei commissum</hi> is subject are the debts of the founder,
                    expenditure by the tenant for the abolition of real charges, for embankment
                    dues, flood-rates, rebuilding, and for bringing worn-out land again into
                    cultivation. The succession is usually limited to male persons; and monks and
                    dishonoured persons are specially excluded. In the Rhine Provinces and many
                    parts of North Germany, <hi rend="italic">fidei commissa</hi> were abolished on
                    the introduction of French law without compensation to the heirs in remainder.
                    They were subsequently re-established, but the 38th section of the Land Rights
                    of the German people (1848) provides— <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fidei commissa</hi> are to be abolished. The form and conditions of such
                    abolition are to be determined by the legislation of each state.” Distinct from
                    <hi rend="italic">fidei commissa</hi> there are in Germany many ancient
                    customary entails, not usually restricted to male heirs, and terminable by
                    agreement of the occupant with the next heir. There was also power to sell in
                    circumstances of necessity subject to preemption by the next heir. Many of these
                    estates rest on family “bye-laws.”</p>
