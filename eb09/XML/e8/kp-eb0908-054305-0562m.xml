                    rend="smallcaps">Esquimaux</hi></label>, the name applied by European
                    ethnologists to a large number of cognate but widely separated tribes, which are
                    scattered along the coasts of the arctic regions of America and Asia. The Danish
                    form of the word has recently supplanted the older French form. The name is a
                    corruption of the Abenaki Indian <hi rend="italic">Eskimat∙ sic</hi> or the
                    Ojiba <hi rend="italic">Askimeg,</hi> both terms meaning “those who eat raw
                    flesh.” The native name is 2nnwii—a word signifying, as names of savage tribes
                    frequently do, <hi rend="italic">“The</hi> people.” The Eskimo constitute a very
                    homogeneous race, and are the widest spread aboriginal people in the world. They
                    are entirely unknown in Europe, being confined to the arctic coast of America,
                    and a small portion of the Asiatic shore of Behring Strait. On the American
                    shores they are found, in broken tribes, from East Greenland to the western
                    shores of Alaska,—never far off' the coast, or south of the region where the
                    winter ice allows seals to congregate in large numbers. They thus stretch for
                    3200 miles from S. E. to S.W.; and though in all likelihood they have little
                    intercourse with each other, yet, judging from the traditions, the separate
                    tribes must have maintained their present characteristic language and mode of
                    life for at least 1000 years. Most probably, like the rest of the aborigines of
                    the New World, they came from Asia at some very <pb break="no"

                    whose modes of life are much the same as the Eskimo, bear a striking resemblance
                    to them in appearance. The Eskimo may thus have been fishing Indians, who
                    formerly lived on the banks of the great rivers which flow into the Polar Ocean,
                    and were gradually driven seaward by the more southern Indians, against whom
                    they to this day maintain a violent enmity. In the course of their migrations
                    they arrived in Grinuell Land, crossed Smith Sound, not further north than Cape
                    Union, according to Nares, then advanced gradually southward along the west
                    coast of Greenland, doubled Cape Farewell, and spread up the east coast as far
                    north as man has yet reached. They may have rounded, with the musk ox and the
                    lemming, the north end of Greenland, but the probabilities are in the direction
                    indicated. Even on hunting expeditions they rarely withdraw more than 20 miles
                    from the coast, and only in very exceptional cases 30 miles. Save a slight
                    admixture of European settlers, they are the only inhabitants of both sides of
                    Davis Strait and Baffin’s Bay. They extend as far south as about 50° N. lat. on
                    the eastern side of America and in the west to 60° on the eastern shore of
                    Behring Strait, while 55° to 60° are their southern limits on the shore of
                    Hudson’s Bay. Throughout all this range no other tribes intervene, except in two
                    small spots on the coast of Western America, where the Kennayan and Ugalenze
                    Indians come down to the shore for the purpose of fishing. The Aleutians are
                    closely allied to the Eskimo in habits and language, though their culture is
                    somewhat more highly developed. Rink divides them into the following groups, the
                    most eastern of which would have to travel nearly 5000 miles to reach the most
                    western. 1. The East Greenland Eskimo, few in number, every year advancing
                    further south, and having intercourse with the next section. 2. The West
                    Greenlanders, civilized, living under the Danish crown, and extending from Cape
                    Farewell to 74° N. lat. 3. The Northernmost Greenlanders —the Arctic Highlanders
                    of Ross—confined to Smith, Whale, Murchison, and Wolstenholme Sounds, north of
                    the Melville Bay glaciers, not extending to the western shores of the former
                    strait, nor within the memory of man having any intercourse with those south of
                    them. They are very isolated, have greatly decreased of late years, did not
                    until recently possess the kayak or skin-covered canoe, the umiak or open skin
                    boat, or the bow and arrow, are bold hunters, pagans, and are perhaps the most
                    typical of the Eskimo in Greenland; they have not of recent years greatly
                    decreased, though at present they do not number more than 200.<note

                <p>5. The Eskimo of the middle regions, occupying the coasts from Hudson’s Bay to
                    Barter Island, beyond Mackenzie River—perhaps comparativelya rather
                    heterogeneous group, inhabiting a stretch of country 2000 miles in length and
                    800 in breadth. 6. The Western Eskimo, from Barter Island to the western limits
                    in America. They differ somewhat from the other groups in various habits, such
                    as the use of the baidar or double-manned skin-covered canoe, in the clothing of
                    the men, in their labrets, and in the head-dress of the women. They are allied
                    to the Aleutians and the Indians of Alaska. 7. The Asiatic Eskimo or Tuski, who
                    are again nearly allied to the Namollo and Itelmes. None of the Arctic tribes of
                    Europe or Asia have the slightest connexion with them. Of all the Eskimo those
                    of Greenland and Labrador are the best known; the others are known but
                    partially.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Appearance and Dress.</hi> —The Eskimo are not so small as they
                    are usually represented, their height—5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 10 inches, and
                    in rare cases even 6 feet—being quite up to the average of the coast Indians.
                    Their dress, however, gives them a dwarfish appearance. Both men and women are
                    muscular and active, the former often inclining to <hi rend="italic"
                    >embonpoint</hi>, and both having a pleasing, good-humoured, and not
                    unfrequently, even handsome cast of countenance, apt to break into a “grin” on
                    very small provocation. The face is broadly oval, flat, with fat cheeks;
                    forehead not high, and rather retreating; teeth good, though, owing to the
                    character of the food, worn down to the gums in old age; nose very flat; eyes
                    rather obliquely set, small, black, and bright; head largish, and covered with
                    coarse black hair, which the women fasten up into a top knot ou their crown, and
                    the men clip in front and allow to hang loose and unkempt behind. Their skulls
                    are of the mesocephalic type, the height being greater than the breadth;
                    according to Davis, 75 is the index of the latter and 77 of the former. Some of
                    the tribes slightly compress the skulls of their new-born children laterally
                    (Hall), but this practice is a very local one. The men have usually a slight
                    moustache, but no whiskers, and rarely any beard. The skin has generally a
                    “bacony” feel, and when cleaned of the smoke, grease, and other dirt—the
                    accumulation of which varies according to the age of the individual—is only so
                    slightly brown that red shows in the cheeks of the children and young women. The
                    people soon age, however. Their hands and feet are small and well formed, and,
                    as a rule, they have a more pleasing appearance than all except the best-looking
                    Indian tribes. The women and children dress entirely in skins of the seal,
                    reindeer, bear, dog, or even fox, the first two being, however, the most common.
                    The men and women’s dress is much the same. The jacket of the men has a hood,
                    which in cold weather is used to cover the head, leaving only the face exposed;
                    it must be drawn over the head, as it has no opening in front or behind. The
                    women’s jacket has a fur-lined “amowt” or large hood for carrying a child, and
                    an absurd looking tail behind, which is, however, usually tucked up. The
                    trousers are either tight or loose, and are fastened into boots made of prepared
                    seal skin, very ingeniously and neatly made. The women’s trousers are usually
                    ornamented with eider duck necks, or embroidery of native dyed leather; their
                    boots, which are of white leather, or (in Greenland) dyed of various colours,
                    reach over the knees, and in some tribes are very wide at the top, thus giving
                    them an awkward appearance and a clumsy waddling walk. In winter there are two
                    suits of clothes of this description, one with the hair inside, the other with
                    it outside. They also sometimes wear shirts of bird-skins, and stockings of dog
                    or young reindeer skins. The boots require to be changed when wet, otherwise
                    they would freeze hard in cold weather. Their clothes are, like all the Eskimo
                    articles of dress or tools, very neatly made, fit beautifully, and are sewn with
                    “sinew-thread,” with a bone needle if a steel one cannot be had. In person the
                    Eskimo are usually filthy, water not often coming in contact with them unless
                    accidentally. The children when very young are, however, sometimes cleaned by
                    being licked with their mother’s tongue before being put into the bag of
                    leathers which serves as their bed, cradle, and blankets.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dwellings, Occupations, Characteristic Implements, and
                    Food.—</hi> In summer the Eskimo live in conical skin tents, and in winter
                    usually in half underground huts <hi rend="italic">(igloos)</hi> built of stone,
                    turf, earth, and bones, entered by a long tunnel-like passage, which can only be
                    traversed on all fours. Sometimes, if residing temporarily at a place, they will
                    erect neat round huts of blocks of snow with a sheet of ice for a window. These,
                    however, though comfortable <pb break="no"

                    spring, and are then deserted. In the roof are deposited their spare harpoons,
                    &amp;c.; and from it is suspended the steatite basin-like lamp, the flames of
                    which, the wick being of moss, serves as fire and light. On one side of the hut
                    is the bench which is used as sofa, seats, and common sleeping place. The floor
                    is usually very filthy, a pool of blood or a dead seal being often to be seen
                    there. Ventilation is almost non-existent; and after the lamp has blazed for
                    some time, the family having assembled, the heat is all but unbearable: the
                    upper garment must be taken off, aud the unaccustomed visitor gasps half
                    asphyxiated in the mephitic atmosphere. In the summer the wolfish-looking dogs
                    lie outside on the roof of the huts, in the winter in the tunnel-like passage
                    just outside the family apartment. The Western Eskimo build their houses chiefly
                    of planks, merely covered on the outside with green turf. The same Eskimo have,
                    in the more populous places, a public room for meetings. “Council chambers” are
                    also said to exist in Labrador, but are only known in Greenland by tradition.
                    Sometimes in South Greenland and in the λVestern Eskimo country the houses are
                    made to accommodate several families, but as a rule each family has a house to
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The Eskimo are solely hunters and fishers, and derive most of their subsistence
                    from the sea. Their country will allow of no cultivation worth attending to; and
                    beyond a few berries, roots, &lt;fcc., they use no vegetable food. They are
                    essentially sarcophagous. The seal, the reindeer when obtainable, and various
                    cetaceous animals supply the bulk of their food, as well as their clothing,
                    light, fuel, and frequently also, when driftwood is scarce or unavailable, the
                    material for various articles of domestic economy. The shuttle-shaped canoe or
                    <hi rend="italic">kayak,</hi> covered with hairless seal skin -stretched on a
                    wooden or whalebone frame, with only a hole in the centre for the paddler, is
                    one of the most characteristic Eskimo implements. The paddler propels it with a
                    bone-tipped double-bladed paddle, like that used in the “canoes” familiar as
                    aquatic playthings in England. He is covered with a waterproof skin or entrail
                    dress, tightly fastened round the mouth of the hole in which he sits, so that,
                    should the canoe overturn, not a drop of water may enter. A skilful kayaker can
                    turn a complete somersault, boat and all, through the water. The <hi
                    rend="italic">umiak</hi> or flat-bottomed skin luggage-boat, rowed by the women,
                    is another, though less interesting, Eskimo vessel. The sledge, made of two
                    runners of wood or bone,—even, in one case on record, of frozen salmon
                    (Maclure),—united by cross bars tied to the runners by hide thongs, and drawn by
                    from 4 to 8 dogs harnessed abreast, is another article of Eskimo domestic
                    economy which no European ingenuity has ever been able to improve. Some of their
                    weapons afford remarkable evidence of inventive skill,—in particular, the
                    harpoon, with the point detachable after it has struck the seal, narwhal, or
                    white whale; the line to which the harpoon is fastened, with the inflated
                    sealskin at the end, which tires out the prey, besides marking its course, and
                    buoys it up when dead; the bird-spears, with bladder attached, and the
                    adventitious side-points which strike the animal should the main one miss it;
                    the rib bow of the wild Eskimo, &lt;fcc. Although they have to maintain a severe
                    struggle for existence against the elements, the Eskimo have been able, in the
                    manufacture of their tools, to develop artistic and mechanical skill far
                    surpassing that of savages more favourably situated, but less endowed with brain
                    power. They sometimes cook their food by boiling, but, when it is frozen, never
                    hesitate to devour it raw. Blood, and the half-digested contents of the
                    reindeer’s paunch, are also eagerly consumed by them; but it is a mistake to
                    suppose that they habitually eat blubber. Fat they are no doubt fond of, but
                    blubber is too precious: it must be kept for winter fuel and light. They are
                    enormous eaters; two Eskimo will easily dispose of a seal at a sitting; and in
                    Greenland, for instance, each individual has for his daily consumption, on an
                    average, 2∣ lb of flesh with blubber, and 1 lb of fish, besides mussels,
                    berries, sea-weed, &amp;c., to which in the Danish settlements may be added 2
                    oz. of imported food. Ten pounds of flesh, in addition to other food, is not
                    uncommonly consumed in a day in time of plenty. A man will lie on his back and
                    allow his wife to feed him with tit-bits of blubber and flesh until he is unable
                    to move.</p>
                <p>The Eskimo cannot be strictly called a wandering race. They are nomadic only in
                    so far that they have to move about from place to place during the fishing and
                    shooting season, following the game in its migrations. They have, however, no
                    regular property. They possess only the most necessary utensils and furniture,
                    with a stock of provisions for less than one year; and these possessions never
                    exceed certain limits fixed upon by tradition or custom (Rink). Long habit and
                    the necessities of their life have also compelled those having food to share
                    with those having none,—a custom which, with others, has conduced to the
                    stagnant condition of Eskimo society and to their utter improvidence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Moral and Mental Character.—</hi> So far as a nation can be
                    characterized in a few words, it may be said that the Eskimo are, if not in the
                    first rank of barbarous races, not in the last, and that, though they want some
                    of the mental endowments of races like the Polynesians, they are equally free
                    from many of their vicious traits. Their intelligence is considerable, as their
                    implements and folk-tales abundantly prove. They display a taste for music,
                    chartography, and drawing, display no small amount of humour, are quick at
                    picking up peculiar traits in strangers, and are painfully acute in detecting
                    the weak points or ludicrous sides of their character. They are excellent
                    mimics, and easily learn the dances and songs of the Europeans, as well as their
                    games, such as chess and draughts. They gamble a little,—but in moderation, for
                    the Eskimo, though keen traders, have a deep-rooted antipathy to speculation.
                    When they offer anything for sale—say at a Danish settlement in Greenland—they
                    always leave it to the buyer to settle the price. They have also a dislike to
                    bind themselves by contract. Hence it was long before the Eskimo in Greenland
                    could be induced to enter into European service, though when they do so
                    now-a-days they pass to almost the opposite extreme—they have no will of their
                    own. It is affirmed by those who ought to know that any sort of licentiousness
                    or indecency which might give rise to public offence is rare among them. In
                    their private life their morality is. however, not high. The women are
                    especially erring; and in Greenland, at places where strangers visit, their
                    extreme laxity of morals, and their utter want of shame, are not more remarkable
                    than the entire absence of jealousy or self-respect on the part of their
                    countrymen and relatives. Theft in Greenland is almost unknown; but the wild
                    Eskimo make very free with strangers’ goods —though it must be allowed that the
                    value they attach to the articles stolen is some excuse for the thieves. Among
                    themselves, on the other hand, they are very honest,—a result of their being so
                    much under the control of public opinion. Lying is said to be as common a trait
                    of the Eskimo as of other savages in their dealings with Europeans. They have
                    naturally not made any figure in literature. Their folk-lore is, however,
                    extensive, and that collected by Dr Rink shows considerable imagination and no
                    mean talent on the part of the story-tellers. In Greenland and Labrador most of
                    the natives have been taught by the missionaries to read and write in their own
                    language. Altogether, the literature published in the Eskimo tongue is
                    considerable. Most of it has been printed in Denmark, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n565/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0565-0546"/> but some has been “set up” in a small printing
                    office in Greenland, from which about 280 sheets have issued, beside many
                    lithographic prints. A journal <hi rend="italic">(Atuagagl-dliutit nalinginarmik
                    tusaruminasassumik uηivkat, i.e.,</hi> “something for reading, accounts of all
                    entertaining subjects”) has been published since 1861. Up to 1874 it extended to
                    194 sheets in 4to, and about 200 leaves with illustrations. Two Eskimo have
                    appeared as authors on a small scale, the last being Hans Hendrik, who has
                    published an autobiography, narrating his life among the Smith Sound Eskimo, and
                    as the hunter of the expeditions of Kane, Hayes, Hall, and Nares. Some of them
                    pick up handicrafts very readily, and those who have wrought in the Copenhagen
                    workshops are said by their employers to learn various kinds of labour more
                    rapidly than average Danish youths of the same age.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion. —</hi> The Eskimo nearly everywhere hold the same
                    religious ideas, though in Greenland and Labrador they are, with few exceptions,
                    nominally at least, Christians. The whole world is, according to the pagan
                    Eskimo’s belief, governed by supernatural powers or “owners,” each of whom holds
                    his sway within natural limits. Any object or individual may have its, his, or
                    her <hi rend="italic">inua,</hi> though generally speaking the idea of an <hi
                    rend="italic">inua</hi> is limited to certain localities or passions—such as a
                    mountain or lake, or strength or eating. The soul, for instance, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">inua</hi> of the body. The earth and the sea rest on pillars, and
                    cover an under-world accessible by various mountain clefts, or by various
                    entrances 'from the sea. The sky is the floor of an upper-world to which some go
                    after death, while others—good or bad—have their future heme in the under-world.
                    Here are the dwellings of the <hi rend="italic">arsissut—</hi> the people who
                    live in abundance. The upper one, on the contrary, is cold and hungry; here live
                    the <hi rend="italic">arssartut</hi> or ball-players, so called from their
                    playing at ball with a walrus head, which gives rise to the aurora borealis. The
                    mediums between the <hi rend="italic">inua</hi> and mankind are the αn^α7roX∙s
                    (Esk. plur., <hi rend="italic">angαkιιt)</hi> or wizards, who possess the
                    peculiar gift of <hi rend="italic">angakoonek—</hi> or the state of “being
                    angakok”—which they have acquired by the aid of guardian spirits called tornαi
                    (plural of <hi rend="italic">tc&gt;rrιakf</hi> who again are ruled by <hi
                    rend="italic">tomarsuk,</hi> the supreme deity or devil of all. Such is their
                    religion in the barest possible outline. They also invoke a supernatural
                    influence which is called <hi rend="italic">kusiunek</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >iliseenek,</hi> which may be translated as witchcraft: this is believed to be
                    the mystic agency which causes sudden sickness or death. In the folk-lore of the
                    Greenlanders as of other nations, divine justice manifests itself chiefly in the
                    present life, though they have a faint belief in reward or punishment in the
                    future world, according as the individual has behaved in this.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language. —</hi> The idiom spoken from Greenland to
                    North-eastern Siberia is, with a few exceptions, the same; any difference is
                    only that of dialect. It differs from the whole group of European languages, not
                    merely in the sound of the words, but more especially, according to Rink, in the
                    construction. Its most remarkable feature is that a sentence of a European
                    language is expressed in Eskimo by a single word constructed out of certain
                    elements, each of which corresponds in some degree to one of our words. One
                    specimen commonly given to visitors to Greenland may suffice: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Savigiksiniariartokasuaromaryotittogog,</hi> which is equivalent to “He says
                    that you also will go away quickly in like manner and buy a pretty knife.” Here
                    is one word serving in the place of 17. It is made up as follows :— <hi
                    rend="italic">Savig</hi> a knife, <hi rend="italic">ik</hi> pretty, <hi
                    rend="italic">sini</hi> buy, <hi rend="italic">ariartok</hi> go away, <hi
                    rend="italic">asuar</hi> hasten, <hi rend="italic">omar</hi> wilt, <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> in like manner, <hi rend="italic">otit</hi> thou, <hi
                    rend="italic">tog</hi> also, <hi rend="italic">og</hi> he says.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Social Economy.—</hi> The Eskimo differ from most other tribes
                    of savages, and notably from those of the rest of America, by having no chiefs
                    or political and military rulers. Fabricius concisely described them in his day
                    :— “Sine Deo, domino, reguntur consuetudine.” The government is mainly a family
                    one, though if a man is distinguished for skill in the chase, strength,
                    shrewdness, or other qualities useful to a wild community, he will no doubt
                    obtain a corresponding influence in the village or settlement. There is also a
                    good deal of dependence of one upon another, as must happen in a people situated
                    as the Eskimo. The family, the inhabitants of a house, and the inhabitants of a
                    wintering place or hamlet are the three subdivisions recognized by the Eskimo;
                    but any connexion between the different wintering places is hardly known and is
                    not recognized. They never go to war with each other; and though revengeful, and
                    apt to injure an enemy secretly, they rarely come to blows, and are morbidly
                    anxious not to give offence. Indeed, in their intercourse with each other they
                    indulge in much hyperbolical compliment, and language courteous from the teeth
                    outwards. But they are not without courage. On the Coppermine and Mackenzie
                    Rivers, where they sometimes come into collision with the Indians, they fight
                    fiercely, and are a name of terror. Polygamy is rare, but the rights of divorce
                    and re-marriage are exercised among the wild Eskimo without any definite
                    restriction. The courtship or marriage customs and the laws of inheritance will
                    be found fully described in the works mentioned in the bibliography. The chief
                    laws are such as the following. Every seal caught at a wintering place should be
                    equally divided as far as it will go. Any one picking up driftwood has only to
                    put some stones on it, as it lies on the shore, to establish his ownership in
                    it. If a seal is harpooned and gets off with the harpoon sticking in it, the
                    first owner loses his right in it if the bladder float gets detached. Any other
                    kind of goods found are the property of the owner. If two hunters at the same
                    time hit a bird, the bird is equally divided between them. All kind of game
                    which is very large or rare is common property. In South Greenland whoever is
                    the first to see a bear has ownership in it, no matter who kills it. The
                    borrower is not bound to give compensation for any injury to the tools of
                    another which he may have borrowed. If a man repent of a bargain he has a right
                    to retract; nothing is sold on credit, or at least without being repaid in a
                    short time. The Greenlanders were always fond of festivals, as are the Eskimo to
                    thisday all over theircountry. When they met each other they used to rub noses
                    together, but this, though a common custom still among the wild Eskimo, is
                    entirely abandoned <hi rend="smallcaps">id</hi> Greenland except for the petting
                    of children. There is, in Greenland at least, no national mode of salutation,
                    either on meeting or parting. When a guest arrives or enters a house, commonly
                    not the least sign is made either by hin? or his host. On leaving a place they
                    now sometimes say “inûvdluaritse,” f.e., live well, and to a European
                    “aporniakinatit,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> do not hurt thy head, viz.,
                    against the upper part of the doorway.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> No precise statement can be made regarding
                    the numbers of the Eskimo race. For Greenland, however, we have exact data so
                    far as the Danish possessions are concerned. In 1870, the date of the last
                    census, there were, from Cape Farewell to the limit of the West Greenland
                    region, 9588 people. Add to this about 200 for Smith’s Sound, and say 400 for
                    East Greenland, and the whole population of that island continent—inhabited and
                    habitable on the coast only—will not be many more than 10,000. On an average,
                    the proportion of females to males in Greenland has been 1118 to 1000, while in
                    Iceland it is 1102, and in Denmark and the Faroe Isles there are 1018 to 1000
                    males. The natives of Greenland have decreased since the Danes came into the
                    country, and at present the population is at a stand-still. On a rough estimate,
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0566-0547"/> whole Eskimo race does not, it is believed,
                    exceed 40,000. But we have really no data, except at spots where they have come
                    in contact with Europeans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bibliography.—</hi> Fragmentary notices of the Eskimo may be
                    found in numerous works. We need only take cognizance here of modern writers who
