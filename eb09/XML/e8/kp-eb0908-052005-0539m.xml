                    Thuringian railway, about midway between Gotha and Weimar, which are 14 miles
                    distant. It is irregularly built, having no street or square worthy of mention,
                    with the exception of the Friedrich-Wilhelmsplatz, which con tains a monument to
                    the elector Frederick Charles Joseph of Mayence. Here are also situated the
                    cathedral and the church of St Severus. The cathedral, built between 1319 and
                    1351, is ont-of the finest ecclesiastical buildings in Germany. It contains some
                    very rich portal sculptures and bronze castings, among others the coronation of
                    Maria by Peter Vischer. In one of its towers is the famous bell called St Maria
                    Gloriosa, which bears the date 1447, and weighs 270 cwt. The name by which this
                    bell is usually known is Grosse Susanna, but this name properly belongs to its
                    predecessor, which was melted by a fire which had attacked the tower. Among the
                    other churches besides that of St Severus may be mentioned the Prediger, the
                    Regler, and the Barfüsser. The only monastery now used is the Ursuline, which
                    for sometime has contained an educational establishment. The Augustine
                    monastery, in which Luther lived as a monk, is now used as an orphange, under
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">Martinsstift.</hi> The cell of Luther was
                    destroyed by fire in 1872 At one time Erfurt had a university, whose charter
                    dated from 1392; but it was suppressed in 1816, and its funds devoted to other
                    purposes, among these being the endowment of an institution founded in 1758, and
                    now called the Royal Academy of Practical Sciences, and the support of the
                    library, which now contains 60,000 vols, and over 1000 manuscripts. Erfurt
                    possesses a great number of educational establishments<pb break="no"

                    school, a school of art and architecture, a midwifery school, and a commercial
                    school· It also possesses, besides the <hi rend="italic">Martins-stiff,</hi> two
                    orphanages, a hospital, two infirmaries, and an eye hospital. The most notable
                    industry of Erfurt is the culture of flowers and of vegetables, which is very
                    extensively carried on. This industry had its origin in the large gardens
                    attached to the monasteries. It has also woollen, cotton, linen, and thread
                    mills; stocking, lace, tobacco, leather, and chemical manufactories; breweries
                    and distilleries. Erfurt was formerly the capital of Thuringia, and until 1873
                    was a fortified town. It is said to have been founded about the 5th century. It
                    was made the seat of a bishop in 740, but soon afterwards lost the dignity. In
                    805 Charles the Great created it a market town, after which it rose rapidly in
                    importance. Although never strictly a free town, it for a long time retained
                    almost complete political independence. In 1483 it renewed a protection league
                    with Saxony, pledging itself at the same time to a yearly contribution of 1500
                    guilders. It attained the height of its prosperity about the end of the 15th
                    century, and is said to have then numbered about 60,000 inhabitants. About the
                    middle of the 17th century it was aunexed by force to the electorate of Mayence,
                    under which government it remained till 1802, when it came into the possession
                    of Prussia. In 1808 it was the scene of the memorable interview between Napoleon
                    and the emperor Alexander of Russia. Here also in the spring of 1850 the Diet
                    known as the Union’s Parliament held its sittings. The population of Erfurt in
                    1875 was 48,025.</p>
