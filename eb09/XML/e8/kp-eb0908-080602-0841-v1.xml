                <p><label type="entry">EXORCISM</label>, the act of expelling evil spirits from
                    persons or places by means of certain adjurations and ceremonies, appears in the
                    present custom or past history of almost every nation of the world. Its
                    importance is greatest among barbarous peoples, whose belief in attacks of
                    demons furnishes them with a general theory to account for misfortunes,
                    mysterious events, and especially all diseases of body or mind, so that the
                    exorcists, who are usually priests or sorcerers, become in fact the recognized
                    order of physicians (see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Demonology).</hi> From
                    among the numerous accounts of modes of exorcism among rude tribes may be
                    instanced that among the Dakota Indians, where the medicine-man summoned to cure
                    a sick person chants “hi-le-li-lah!” to the accompaniment of a gourd rattle, and
                    sucks at the part affected till the possessing spirit is supposed to come out
                    and take flight, when men in waiting at the tent-door fire guns at it
                    (Schoolcraft, <hi rend="italic">Indian Tribes of North America,</hi> part i. p.
                    250, part ii. p. 199); and that of the Zulus, among whom the ghosts of the dead
                    who enter men’s bodiee and cause disease are got rid of by the sacrifice of
                    cattle, with expostulations, such as, “I say, cease; leave off making me ill”
                    (Callaway, <hi rend="italic">Religious System of the Amazulu,</hi> p. 157). In
                    the most ancient known civilizations we find records of exorcism. An Egyptian
                    tablet records the possession of a princess of the land of Bakhten by a demon,
                    and the exorcism of this spirit by the god Khonsu, who was sent thither in his
                    ark and cured her at once, the spirit saying, “Thou hast come in peace, great
                    god, driver away of possessors. I am thy slave, I will go to the place whence I
                    came” (Birch, in <hi rend="italic">Records</hi><hi rend="italic">of the
                        Past,</hi> vol. iv. p. 53). Among the formulas in ancient Babylonian
                    exorcism are such as these :—“May the noxious spirit of the neck, the noxious
                    wind, from the man himself and the clothing of the body be driven forth!” “From
                    the burning spirit of the entrails, which devours the man, may the king of
                    heaven preserve!” (Sayce, in <hi rend="italic">Records</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                        the Past,</hi> vol. i. p. 131). In Greece men of no less distinction than
                    Epicurus and Aeschines were the sons of women who lived by the exorcist’s art;
                    and both were bitterly reproached, the one by the Stoics, and the other by
                    Demosthenes <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Cor.),</hi> for having
                    assisted their parents in these practices. This power was in some instances
                    considered as a divine gift; in others it was thought to be acquired by
                    investigations into the nature of demons and the qualities of natural
                    productions, as herbs, stones, &amp;c., and by the use of certain forms of
                    adjurations and ceremonies. The power of expelling demons Josephus places among
                    the endowments of Solomon, and relates that he left behind him the manner of
                    using exorcisms by which they drive away demons. (For the pretended fragments of
                    these books see Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Cod. Pseud. Vet. Test.,</hi> p.
                    1054.) He relates that he had seen a man named Eleazar releasing people that
                    were demoniacal, in the presence of Vespasian, his sons, captains, and soldiers,
                    by means of a certain root set in a ring, on the application of which to the
                    nose of the patient, the devil was expelled through his nostrils. (See <hi
                        rend="italic">Antig.</hi> viii. 2, § 5; and <hi rend="italic">De Bell.
                        dud.</hi> vii. 6, § 3.) The profession of exorcist was not uncommon among
                    the Jews; and the epithet applied to such persons <hi rend="italic"
                        >(τr(pιeρχομTvωv;</hi> Vulg., <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >circumeuntibus</hi><hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic">udoeis)</hi>
                    perhaps iudicates that they were travelling mountebanks. The passages of the New
                    Testament which refer to the exorcism of demons from epileptic, insane, and
                    other diseased persons are too numerous and well known to require particular
                    reference. The prominence of exorcism in the early ages of the Christian church
                    appears from its frequent mention in the writings of the fathers, and by the 3d
                    century there seems to have been an order of exorcists (see Bingham, <hi
                        rend="italic">Antiquities of the Christian Church).</hi> The ancient rite of
                    exorcism in connexion with baptism is still retained in the Roman ritual, as is
                    also a form of service for the exorcising of possessed persons. The exorcist
                    signs the possessed person with the figure of the cross, desires him to kneel,
                    and sprinkles him with holy water; after which the exorcist asks the devil his
                    name, and abjures him by the holy mysteries of the Christian religion not to
                    afflict the person possessed any more. Then, laying his right hand on the
                    demoniac’s head, he repeats the form of exorcism as follows: “I exorcise thee,
                    unclean spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ; tremble, O Satan, thou enemy of the
                    faith, thou foe of mankind, who hast brought death into the world, who has
                    deprived men of life, and hast rebelled against justice, thou seducer of
                    mankind, thou root of evil, thou source of avarice, discord, and envy.” Houses
                    and other places supposed to be haunted by unclean spirits are likewise to be
                    exorcised with similar ceremonies.</p>
