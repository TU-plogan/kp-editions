                <p><label type="entry">EPHORUS</label>, a Greek historian of Cumae in Aeolis,
                    flourished about 408 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His father’s name was
                    Demophilus or Antiochus; and he studied along with Eudoxus and Theopompus under
                    the philosopher Isocrates.</p>
                <p>The chief work of Ephorus was a history of the wars between the Greeks and
                    Persians, in which, like Herodotus, he introduced the description of foreign and
                    barbarous nations in the form of episodes. Only a few disconnected fragments of
                    it have come down to us. According to the scheme of Marx, the first book
                    contained an account of the return of the Heraclidae into the Peloponnesus, and
                    the change of affairs consequent upon that event; the second was occupied with
                    the state of the rest of Greece; and the third narrated the departure of the
                    Greek colonies to Asia. In these three books he thus brought the history of
                    Greece and Asia down to that period when they began to assume a peaceful aspect,
                    probably a few years before the commencement of the Median war. After this
                    introduction be proceeded to describe separately each country which subsequently
                    became the scene of important transactions,—in the fourth book Europe, in the
                    fifth Asia and Africa; and in the sixth he probably gave an account of the
                    nation of the Pelasgi. The seventh book contained the most ancient traditionary
                    notices of Sicily, and probably all he could collect respecting the original
                    inhabitants of Italy and the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0489-0470"/> adjacent islands. The eighth book narrated the
                    various changes of fortune to which those nations had been subject who in
                    succession held the supreme command in Asia, namely, the Assyrians, Lydians, and
                    Persians. The fragments which remain refer principally to the history of
                    Croesus. In the ninth book he described the origin, changes, and migrations of
                    the Amazons, Scythians, and other nations who inhabited the coasts of the Pontus
                    and those northern countries, whence, through Thrace and Thessaly, he returned
                    to Greece and its affairs. Then it was that Ephorus reached the period when,
                    like every Greek historian, he imagined that the transactions of the whole world
                    became centred in the causes and events of the Persian war; and then also he
                    began to treat his subject with more copiousness, for we find that, while in his
                    tenth book he had already brought down his history to the times of Miltiades,
                    about 490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> in his eighteenth book he had reached
                    Dercyllidas, 399, and in his twentyfifth he had arrived at the battle of
                    Mantinea, 362. The part of the thirtieth book which gave an account of the
                    sacred war was composed, not by Ephorus himself, but by his son Demophilus. At
                    the conclusion of the war Ephorus took up the thread of the history, and
                    continued it to the siege of Perinthus, 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    According to Diodorus Siculus, the whole period treated of was 750 years.</p>
