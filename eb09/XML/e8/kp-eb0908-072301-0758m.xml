                    the cause of Arius in his quarrel with his bishop Alexander, and wrote a letter
                    in his defence to Paulinus, bishop of Tyre, which is preserved in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Church History</hi> of Theodoret. His views appear to have been
                    identical with those of his namesake in placing Christ above all created beings,
                    the only begotten of the Father, but in refusing to recognize Him to be “of the
                    same substance” with the Father, who is alone in essence and absolute being.</p>
                <p>At the council of Nicaea Eusebius of Nicomedia earnestly opposed, along with his
                    namesake of Caesarea, the insertion of the Homoousion clause, but after being
                    defeated in his object he also signed the creed in his own sense of 6poιoς xατ ’
                    ουσίαν. He refused, however, to sign the anathema directed against the Arians,
                    not, as he afterwards explained, because of his variance from the Athanasian
                    theology, but “because he doubted whether Λrius really held what the anathema;
                    imputed to him” (Sozom., ii. 15). After the council he continued zealously to
                    espouse the Arian cause, and was so far carried away in his zeal against the
                    Athanasians that he was temporarily banished from his see, and visited with the
                    displeasure of the emperor as a disturber of the peace of the church. But his
                    alienation from the court was of short duration. He retained the confidence of
                    the emperor’s sister Constantia, through whose special influence he is supposed
                    to have been promoted to the see of Nicomedia, and by her favour he was restored
                    to his position, and speedily acquired an ascendency over the mind of the
                    emperor no less than that of his sister. He was selected to administer baptism
                    to him in his last illness. There seems no doubt that Eusebius of Nicomedia was
                    more of a politician than a theologian. He was certainly a partisan in the great
                    controversy of his time, and is even credited (although on insufficient
                    evidence) with having used disgraceful means to procure the deposition of
                    Eustathius, the “orthodox” bishop of Antioch (Theodoret, i. 21). His restless
                    ambition and love of power are not to be denied. To the last he defended Arius,
                    and at the time of the latter’s sudden death, 337, it was chiefly through his
                    menace, as representing the emperor, that the church of Constantinople had been
                    thrown into such anxiety as to whether the leader should be re-admitted to the
                    bosom of the church. Eusebius himself died in 342.</p>
