                    is the judicial exclusion of a baptized person from the fellowship of the
                    visible church of Christ. As part of the discipline of the church it is based on
                    the precept of Christ (Mat. xvi. 19, xviii. 15-18; John xx. 23), and on
                    apostolic example (1 Cor. v. 5; 1 Tim. i. 20, &amp;c.). These and the other
                    texts, however, bearing, or supposed to bear, on the subject of excommunication,
                    have not by any means been uniformly interpreted; and the usages ostensibly
                    based on them have differed accordingly. The praxis of Christian discipline,
                    moreover, has never been wholly independent of Jewish and pagan influences; and
                    its variations cannot be adequately explained unless account be taken of several
                    non-Christian analogues of excommunication. Among other pagan analogues may be
                    mentioned the Greek <hi rend="italic">γepvlβωv clpγeσθαc</hi> (Demos. 505, 14),
                    with its consequences (Aesch., <hi rend="italic">Choeph.</hi> 283; <hi
                    rend="italic">Rum.</hi> 625 f.; Soph., <hi rend="italic">(Ed*Tyτ.</hi> 236 ff.);
                    the Roman <hi rend="italic">exsecratio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">diris
                    devotio;</hi> the awful power which the Druids claimed of excluding from the
                    sacrifices (Caes., <hi rend="italic">B. G.,</hi> vi. 13). But more influential
                    than any of these has been the ancient Jewish practice. The word used in the New
                    Testament to describe an excommunicated person, <hi rend="italic"
                    >αvαθ&lt;ψα</hi> (1 Cor. xvi. 22; Gal. i. 8, 9; Rom. ix. 3), is the constant
                    LXX. rendering of the Hebrew D ’ J∏ (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anathema).</hi>
                    This word (⅛erem), in its <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0834-0799"/> primary signification moans simply any person or
                    thing separated or set apart, a meaning which is still seen in the familiar
                    Arabic word “harem.” The connexion in thought between the notions separation
                    from common use, dedication to God, and devotion to destruction is not very
                    obscure, and it soon established itself in the Hebrew mind. In Lev. xxvii. 21,
                    28, 29, we read that no “devoted” person or thing was to be sold or redeemed;
                    “none which shall be ‘ devoted ’ from among men shall be redeemed, but shall
                    surely be put to death.” The Hebrew <hi rend="italic">mohoram</hi> (devoted) was
                    precisely in the same position as the Latin <hi rend="italic">impius</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">sacer</hi> (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Pom. Alt.,</hi> ii. 50
                    ff.). In Num. xxi. 2, 3, Deut. ii. 34, iii. 6, vii. 2, we find whole cities or
                    nations thus “banned,” “excommunicated,” or devoted to destruction. We
                    occasionally read of Israelites as well as of aliens falling under this ban
                    (e.p., in Judg. xxi. 5, 11); indeed, the extreme penalty of being “cut off,”
                    which is attached to so many sins, appears to have been carried into effect by
                    the congregation only after the had been duly pronounced by the competent
                    authority (Ex. xxii. 19 [20]; Deut, xiii. 7-18 [6-17]; <hi rend="italic"
                    >cf.</hi> Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Alterth.,</hi> pp. 101, 420). If in this we
                    already find the aualogue of the major excommunication (called anathema) of the
                    mediaeval church, we may perhaps look for the analogue of the minor in that
                    temporary separation or seclusion (niddah) which was prescribed for ceremonial
                    uncleanness. Scripture furnishes no distinct trace of the use of the deadly
                    anathema in postexile times; it is probable, however, that the right of
                    sentencing by a to capital punishment remained with the Jewish ecclesiasti
                    co-civil authorities to a very late period (Ezra vii. 25, 26). In Ezra x. 8, it
                    ought to be observed, we read of an excommunication of a milder kind; its effect
                    was that all the substance of the offender was “forfeited” (∕.e., laid under a
                    herem), but he himself merely “separated” from the congregation.</p>
                <p>The Talmud recognizes two kinds of excommunication, a minor and a major, called
                    respectively niddui and herein. The niddui (from <hi rend="italic">nιddah,</hi>
                    to drive away) could be pronounced at any time by any competent individual <hi
                    rend="italic">(cum</hi><hi rend="italic">periculo,</hi> of course); its validity
                    continued for thirty days, during which period the subject of it was expected to
                    go into mourning, absent himself from the synagogue, and separate himself from
                    all bis fellows by a distance of not less than four ells. He was not excluded
                    from the temple, but if he visited it he was required to enter by a separate
                    door. If at the end of thirty days he showed impenitence or contumacy, the
                    niddui might be renewed once and again; and finally, in certain circumstances,
                    the ⅛erem might be pronounced. A valid herein, which could only be pronounced by
                    a court of not less than ten judges, had the effect of excluding from the temple
                    as well as from the synagogue, and from all association with the faithful. Some
                    writers have asserted that there was a still more terrible, because irrevocable,
                    sentence called the shammatta; but the preponderance of evidence is against this
                    statement. (See Buxtorf’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon,</hi> p. 2466; and Selden,
                    <hi rend="italic">De Jure Nat.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gen.,</hi> iv. 9.) Among modern instances of expulsion from the Jewish
                    communion, that of Spinoza (16th July 1656) for contempt of the law has became
                    famous. The text of the curse pronounced upon the culprit, which is similar to
                    that given by Selden (as above, iv. 7), may be taken as a fair specimen of the
                    formulae then in use. The <hi rend="italic">Exemplar Humaηai</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vitoe</hi> of Uriel d’Acosta may also be referred to.</p>
                <p>As an authority upon Jewish usages the Talmud does not .go nearly so far back as
                    to the beginning of the first Christian century. It is to the New Testament
                    alone that we must look for any little information that can be had on the
                    contemporary practice of the Jewish courts. The sentence of exclusion from the
                    synagogue is plainly indicated in Luke vi. 22, John ix. 22, xii. 42, and the
                    more severe sentence seems to be hinted at in John xvi. 2. The question as to
                    the period at which the Jewish synedrium ceased to have the power of giving full
                    effect to the herem spoken of in Leviticus, has been much disputed. The Talmud
                    itself says that the judgment of capital causes was taken away from Israel forty
                    years before the destruction of the temple. But the point whether the synedrium
                    which tried Jesus Christ could lawfully claim that power is still unsettled.</p>
                <p>It has been already said that the use of excommunication as a part of Christian
                    discipline, is based on the precept of Christ and on the apostolic practice. The
                    general principles which ought to be observed can be easily gathered from the
                    New Testament writings; but the church appears to have been left, for most of
                    the practical details, to the guidance of reason and experience. Mat. xviii. 17
                    leaves unsolved many questions which cannot fail to arise as to the occasion,
                    nature, and effects of excommunication. Tit. iii. 10, which enjoins the
                    “rejection” (comp. 1 Tim. iv. 7) of a “heretic” after two “admonitions,” can
                    hardly be called more explicit. The <hi rend="italic">locus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">classicus</hi> is 1 Cor. v. taken in connexion with 1 Tim. i. 20.
                    In the former passage, much importance has been attached to the apparent
                    distinction between the αΓp∈ιv ∈κ <hi rend="italic">μεαoυ</hi> in vs. 2, 13, and
                    the 7ταpαδowαι τω ⅛τara in v. 5, the former being (it is alleged) within the
                    competency of the congregation, and the latter a purely apostolic function. The
                    <hi rend="italic">ανάθεμα,</hi>-or “delivering over to Satan for the destruction
                    of the flesh,” has been the subject of much dispute (see Bingham, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> xvi. 2, 15). The language may safely be assumed to
                    have been borrowed from an older formula. Plainly it was intended as the highest
                    censure, to be pronounced only on grave offenders. It is also manifest that it
                    was not irrevocable, and that it was in every case meant to have a salutary
                    disciplinary effect upon the soul.</p>
                <p>The writings of the church fathers give sufficient evidence that two degrees of
                    excommunication, the <hi rend="italic">άφορισμός</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >άφορισμος παντελής,</hi> as they were generally called, were in use during, or
                    at least soon after, the apostolic age. The former, which involved exclusion
                    from participation in the eucharistie service and from the eucharist itself,
                    though not from the so-called “service of the catechumens,” was the usual
                    punishment of comparatively light offences; the latter, which was the penalty
                    for graver scandals, involved “exclusion from all church privileges,”—a vague
                    expression which has sometimes been interpreted as meaning total exclusion from
                    the very precincts of the church building <hi rend="italic">(inter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hiemantes orare),</hi> and from the favour of God (Bingham, xvi.
                    2, 16). For some sins, such as adultery, the sentence of excommunication was in
                    the 2d century regarded as 7ταrτeλτ∕ς in the sense of being irrevocable.
                    Difference of opinion as to the absolutely “irremissible” character of mortal
                    sins led to the important controversy associated with the names of Zephyrinus,
                    Tertullian, Callistus, Hippolytus, Cyprian, and Novatian, in which the stricter
                    and more montanistic party held that for those who had been guilty of such sins
                    as theft, fraud, denial of the faith, there should be no restoration to church
                    fellowship even in the hour of death. On this point the provincial synods of
                    Illiberis (Elvira) in 305 and of Ancyra in 315 subsequently came to conflicting
                    decisions. But the excommunication was on all hands regarded as being
                    “medicinal” in its character. It is noteworthy that the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >ανάθεμα</hi> had fallen into disuse about the beginning of the 4th century, and
                    that, throughout the same period, no instance of the judicial use of the phrase
                    παpαδo⅛αι rω <hi rend="italic">Σατανά,</hi> can be found.</p>
                <p>A new chapter in the history of church censure may be said to have begun with the
                    publication of those imperial edicts against heresy the first of which, <hi
                    rend="italic">De sumrnα</hi><hi rend="italic">trinitate</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0835-0800"/><hi rend="italic">catholica,</hi> dates from 380.
                    Till then exclusion from church privileges had been a spiritual discipline
                    merely; thenceforward it was to expose a man to serious temporal risks.
                    Excommunication still continued to be occasionally used in the spirit of genuine
                    Christian fidelity, as by Ambrose in the case of Theodosius himself (390); but
                    the temptation to wield it as an instrument of secular tyranny too often proved
                    to be irresistible. In the formula used by Synesius (410), which is to be found
                    in Bingham and in most other works of reference, we already find the attention
                    of magistrates specially called to the censured person. The history of the next
                    thousand years shows that the magistrates were seldom slow to respond to the
                    appeal. Even the hastiest survey of that long and interesting period enables the
                    student to notice a marked development in the theory and practice of
                    excommunication. One or two points may be specially noted. (1.) While it had
                    been held as an undoubted principle by the ancient church that this sentence
                    could only be passed on living individuals, whose fault had been distinctly
                    stated and fully proved, we find the mediaeval church on the one hand
                    sanctioning the practice of excommunication of the dead (Morinus, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Poenit.,</hi> x., c. 9), and, on the other hand, by means of
                    the papal interdict, excluding whole counties and kingdoms at once from every
                    church privilege. The earliest well-authenticated instance of such an interdict
                    is that which was passed (998) by Pope Gregory V. on France, in consequence of
                    the contumacy of King Robert the Wise. Other instances are those laid
                    respectively on Germany in 1102 by Gregory VH. (Hildebrand), on England in 1208
                    by Innocent III., on Rome itself in 1155 by Adrian IV. (2.) While in the ancient
                    church the language used in excommunicating had been carefully measured, we find
                    an amazing recklessness in the phraseology employed by the mediaeval clergy. The
                    curse of Ernulphus or Arnulphus of Rochester (cir. 1100), which has been made
                    familiar to most students of English literature, is a very fair specimen of that
                    class of composition. With it may be compared the formula transcribed by Dr
                    Burton in his <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> (iii. 317 ff.). To the
                    spoken word was added the language of symbol. By means of lighted candles
                    violently dashed to the ground and extinguished the faithful were graphically
                    taught the meaning of the greater excommunication,—though in a somewhat
                    misleading way, for it is a fundamental principle of the canon law that <hi
                    rend="italic">disciplina est excommunicatio,</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eradicatio.</hi> The first instance, however, of excommunication
                    by “bell, book, and candle” is comparatively late (cir. 1190).</p>
                <p>At the Reformation the necessity for church discipline did not cease to be
                    recognized; but the administration of it in many Reformed churches passed
                    through a period of some confusion. In some instances the old episcopal power
                    passed more or less into the hands of the civil magistrate (a state of matters
                    which was highly approved by Erastus and his followers), in other cases it was
                    conceded to the presbyterial courts. In the Anglican Church the bishops (subject
                    to appeal to the sovereign) have the right of excommunicating, and their
                    sentence, if sustained, may in certain cases carry with it civil
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>In the law of England sentence of excommunication, upon being properly certified
                    by the bishop, was followed by the writ <hi rend="italic">de excommunicato
                    capiendo</hi> for the arrest of the offender. The statute 5 Eliz. c. 23 provided
                    for the better execution of this writ. By the 53 Geo. III. c. 127 (which does
                    not, however, extend to Ireland) it was enacted that “excommunication, together
                    with all proceedings following thereupon, shall in all cases, save those
                    hereafter to be specified, be discontinued.” Disobedience to or contempt of the
                    ecclesiastical courts is to be punished by a new writ <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">contumace</hi><hi rend="italic">capiendo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> j</hi> to follow on the certificate of the judge that
                    the defender is contumacious and in contempt. Sect. 2 provides that nothing
                    shall prevent “any ecclesiastical court from pronouncing or declaring persons to
                    be excommunicate on definite sentences pronounced as spiritual censures for
                    offences of ecclesiastical cognizance.” No persons so excommunicated shall incur
                    any civil penalty or incapacity whatever, save such sentence of imprisonment,
                    not exceeding six months, as the court shall direct and certify to the Queen in
                    Chancery.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, three degrees of church censure are recognized—admonition,
                    suspension from sealing ordinances (which may be called temporary
                    excommunication), and excommunication properly so called. Intimation of the las
                    <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>- named censure is occasionally (but very rarely)
                    given by authority of a presbytery in a public and solemn manner, according to
                    the following formula :—“Whereas thou N. hast been by sufficient proof convicted
                    of (here mention the sin) and after due admonition and prayer remainest
                    obstinate without any evidence or sign of true repentance: Therefore in the name
                    of the Lord Jesus Christ, aud before this congregation, I pronounce and declare
                    thee N. excommunicated, shut out from the communion of the faithful, debar thee
                    from privileges, and deliver thee unto Satan for the destruction of thy flesh,
                    that thy spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” This is called the
                    greater excommunication. The congregation are thereafter warned to shun all
                    unnecessary converse with the excommunicate. (See <hi rend="italic">Form of
                    Process,</hi> c. 8.) Formerly excommunicated persons were deprived of feudal
                    rights in Scotland; but in 1690 all Acts enjoining civil pains upon sentences of
                    excommunication were finally repealed (Burton’s <hi rend="italic">History,</hi>
                    vii. 435). <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> s. <hi rend="smallcaps">bl.)</hi></p>
