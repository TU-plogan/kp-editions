                <p><label type="entry">EPICURUS</label>, the founder of the Epicurean school of
                    philosophy, was born in the end of 342 or the beginning of 341 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> seven years after the death of Plato. His father
                    Neocles belonged to Gargettos, one of the small villages of Attica, but had
                    settled in Samos, not later than 352, as one of the colonists sent out by the
                    Athenian state after the conquest of the island by Timotheus in 366. In Samos,
                    and also at Teos, Epicurus passed the early years of his life, probably
                    assisting his father, who was a common schoolmaster, possibly, too, assisting
                    his mother Archestrata in the practice of her witchcraft—if we may believe
                    doubtful tales. At the age of 18 he went to Athens, where the Platonic school
                    was flourishing under the lead of Xenocrates, and which Aristotle had recently
                    quitted for Chalcis to avoid an indictment for impiety. This visit to Athens,
                    however, was a short one, for in the next year (322) Antipater the Macedonian
                    punished the Athenians for their incipient revolt by banishing about 12,000 of
                    the poorer citizens to distant shores. It was in connection with this event that
                    Epicurus joined his father, who was now located at Colophon. It seems possible
                    that before this time he had listened to some lectures from Nausiphanes, a
                    Democritean philosopher—perhaps also from others—but there is little reason to
                    suppose that he was much better than a petty teacher like his father. The first
                    awakening of the philosophic spirit was seen, it is said, when he asked his
                    teacher, as they read together in Hesiod how chaos was the first of all things,
                    “What then preceded chaos ?” Stimulated further by the perusal of some writings
                    of Democritus, Epicurus began to formulate a doctrine of his own; and at
                    Mitylene and Lampsacus, where he spent several years, he gradually gathered
                    round him several disciples who adopted his views with enthusiasm. In 307, the
                    year in which Demetrius Poliorcetes entered Athens and restored to it au at
                    least nominal freedom, Epicurus returned to that city, which had now for a
                    century and a half been the recognized head-quarters of Greek philosophy. Half
                    his life was past; for the remaining thirty-six years he continued at Athens,
                    with the exception of one or two visits to his friends in Ionia. The scene of
                    his philosophic life and teaching was a garden which he bought at the cost of
                    about £300 (80 minae). There he passed his days as the loved and venerated head
                    of a remarkable society, such as the ancient world had never seen. Amongst the
                    number were Metrodorus, a bosom-friend of more energetic temper ament than
                    Epicurus; during their acquaintance, which lasted till the death of Metrodorus
                    seven years before his friend, they only parted company for the space of six
                    months. Timocrates, a brother of Metrodorus, was another member; so were
                    Polyaenus, a fair-minded and studious man, Hermarchus, a son of poor parents,
                    who succeeded Epicurus as chief of the school, Leonteus, and others. Nor were
                    women absent from the philosophic coterie. Themista, the wife of Leonteus, was a
                    friend and correspondent of Epicurus; Tdomeneus, another member, had married a
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n492/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0492-0473"/> sister of Metrodorus; and Metrodorus himself had
                    as his consort Leontion, once a hetaera in Athens, but now the mother of a boy
                    and girl, for whose welfare Epicurus made special provision in his will. That
                    these were not the only ladies in the society is possible enough, and it is
                    possible that the relations between the sexes—in this prototype of Rabelais’s
                    Abbey of Thelème—were not entirely what is termed Platonic. But there is on the
                    other hand scarcely a doubt that the tales of licentiousness which ill-tempered
                    opponents circulated regarding the society of the garden are groundless. The
                    stories of the Stoics, who sought occasionally to refute the views of Epicurus
                    by an appeal to his alleged antecedents and habits, were no doubt in the main,
                    as Diogenes Laertius says, the stories of maniacs. The general charges against
                    him which they endeavoured to substantiate by forged letters need not count for
                    much. Even when they tried to show that he was not a citizen with full rights,
                    that he was a plagiarist of other men’s wisdom, a correspondent of ladies whom
                    the aristocracy of the period held of dubious rank, an ignoramus, and a
                    scandalous and abusive critic of his opponents, they only exaggerated what, if
                    true, was not so heinous as they wished it to appear. Against them trustworthy
                    authorities testified to his general and remarkable considerateness; they
                    pointed to the statues which the city had raised in his honour, and above all to
                    the numbers of his friends, who were many enough to fill whole cities.</p>
                <p>The mode of life in his community was plain. The general drink was water, and the
                    food barley bread; half a pint of wine was held an ample allowance. “Send me,”
                    says Epicurus to a correspondent, “send me some Cythnian cheese, so that, should
                    I choose, I may fare sumptuously.” But though they lived together, Epicurus
                    would not let his friends throw all their property into the common.stock; that,
                    he remarked, would imply distrust of their own and others’ good resolutions. The
                    company was held in unity by the siren-like charms of his personality, and by
                    the free sociality which he inculcated and exemplified. Though he seems to have
                    had a warm affection for his countrymen, it was as human beings brought into
                    contact with him, and not as members of a political body, that he preferred to
                    regard them. He never entered public life. His kindliness extended even to his
                    slaves, one of whom, named Mouse, was a brother in philosophy.</p>
                <p>Epicurus, died of stone in 270 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In a letter to a
                    friend, he speaks of the pleasure afforded to him in his sufferings by the
                    remembrance of happy hours spent in reasoning on the questions of philosophy. He
                    passed away bidding his friends keep in mind the doctrines he had taught them.
                    By his will he left his property, consisting of the garden, a house in Melite
                    (the south-west quarter of Athens), and apparently some funds besides, to two
                    trustees for behoof of his society, and for the special interest of some
                    youthful members. The garden was set apart fcr the use of the school; the house
                    became the house of Hermarchus and his fellow-philosophers during his life-time.
                    The surplus proceeds of the property were further to be applied to maintain a
                    yearly offering in commemoration of his departed father, mother, and brothers,
                    to pay the expenses incurred in celebrating his own birthday every year on the
                    7th Gamelion, and for a social gathering of the sect on the 20th of every month
                    in honour of himself and Metrodorus. Besides similar tributes in honour of his
                    brothers and Polyaenus, he directed the trustees to be guardians of the son of
                    Polyaenus and the son of Metrodorus; whilst the daughter of the last-mentioned
                    was to be married by the guardian to some ’member of the society who should be
                    approved of by Hermarchus. His four slaves, three men and one woman, were left
                    their freedom. His books passed on to Hermarchus.</p>
                <p>Epicurus was a voluminous writer,—the author, it is said, of about 300 works. He
                    had a style and vocabulary of his own. His chief aim in writing was plainness
                    and intelligibility, but his want of order and of logical precision considerably
                    thwarted the realization of his purpose. He pretended to have read little, and
                    to be the original architect of his own system, and the claim was no doubt on
                    the whole true. But he had read Democritus, and it is said Anaxagoras and
                    Archelaus were also amongst his more favourite philosophical authors. His works,
                    it is said, were full of repetition,—which was natural enough; and critics
                    profess to have found in them some vulgarities of language and faults of style.
                    But at any rate they were read and remembered, his pupils got them by heart, and
                    to the last era of Epicureanism they continued in full authority. His chief work
                    was a treatise on nature, in thirty-seven books, of which fragments from about
                    nine books have been found in the rolls discovered at Herculaneum, along with
                    considerable treatises by several of his followers, and most notably Philodemus.
                    An epitome of his doctrine is contained in three letters preserved by
                    Diogenes.</p>
                <p>The Epicurean philosophy is traditionally divided into the three branches of
                    logic, physics, and ethics. But it is only as a basis of facts and principles
                    for his theory of life that logical and physical inquiries find a place at all.
                    Epicurus himself had not apparently shared in any large or liberal culture, and
                    his influence was certainly thrown on the side of those who depreciated purely
                    scientific pursuits as one-sided and misleading. “Steer clear of all culture”
                    was his advice to a young disciple. In this aversion to a purely or mainly
                    intellectual training may be traced a recoil from the systematic metaphysics of
                    Plato and Aristotle. With these writers the tendency was to sacrifice the moral
                    to the intellectual—to subordinate the practical man to the philosopher. Ethics
                    had been based upon logic and metaphysics; more had been done to explain the
                    formation of a right judgment in matters of morality than to explain or promote
                    right action. But every-day experience showed that no amount of merely
                    intellectual study is preventive of immorality, and that the systematic
                    knowledge of truth is one thing and right action is another. It seemed to many
                    as well as to Epicurus that the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle led to an
                    aristocracy of intellect, but not to a commonwealth of happiness and goodness.
                    In this way a reaction set in against reasoning and speculation; people wanted
                    to get back to common sense and the feelings of ordinary men. In the second
                    place, Plato and Aristotle had constructed their moral theories on the
                    assumption that a state or a city existed which both showed in the shape of its
                    several institutions how the individual man was expected to behave, and
                    threatened him with various penalties in case he attempted to find out a way of
                    action for himself. They could accordingly give themselves the comparatively
                    easy task of showing how the individual could learn to apprehend and embody in
                    his own conduct the moral law which was exhibited in the institutions of
                    society. But experience had in the time of Epicurus shown the temporary and
                    artificial character of the civic form of social life. It was necessary
                    therefore for Epicurus to go back to nature to find a more enduring and a wider
                    foundation for ethical doctrine, and to decline the help that might be derived
                    from a consideration of the existing form of political union. It was no less
                    necessary to go back from words to realities, to give up reasoning? and get at
                    feelings, to test conceptions and arguments by a final reference to the only
                    touchstone of truth—to sensation. There, and there only, one seems to find a
                    common and a satisfactory ground, supposing always that all men's feelings give
                    the same answer. Logic must <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0493-0474"/> go, but so also must the state, as a
                    specially-privileged and eternal order of things, as anything more than a
                    contrivance serving certain purposes of general utility.</p>
                <p>To the Epicureans the elaborate logic of the Stoics was a superfluity. In place
                    of logic we find canonic, the theory of the tests of truth and reality. The only
                    ultimate canon of reality is sensation and feeling; whatever we feel, whatever
                    we perceive by any sense, that we know on the most certain evidence we can have
                    to be real, and in proportion as our feeling is clear, distinct, and vivid, in
                    that proportion are we sure of the reality of its object. The truth of anything
                    is measured by its vivid and effective presence in consciousness. But in what
                    that vividness (ενάργεια) consists is a question which Epicurus does not raise,
                    and which he would no doubt have deemed superfluous quibbling over a matter
                    sufficiently settled by common sense. Besides our sensations, we learn truth and
                    reality by our preconceptions or ideas <hi rend="italic">(yrpoληψeL&lt;s).</hi>
                    These are the fainter image3 produced by repeated sensations, the “ideas”
                    resulting from previous “impressions”— sensations at second-hand as it were,
                    which are stored up in memory, and which a general name serves to recall. These
                    bear witness to reality, not because we feel anything now, but because we felt
                    it once; they are sensations registered in language, and again, if need be,
                    translatable into immediate sensations or groups of sensation. Lastly, reality
                    is vouched for by the imaginative apprehensions of the mind <hi rend="italic"
                    >(φανταστικοί ετηβολαΐφ,</hi> immediate feelings of which the mind is conscious
                    as produced by some action of its own. This last canon, however, was of dubious
                    validity. Epicureanism generally stopped by affirming that whatever we
                    effectively feel in consciousness is real; in which sense they allow reality to
                    the fancies of the insane, the dreams of a sleeper, and those feelings by which
                    we imagine the existence of beings of perfect blessedness and endless life. And
                    similarly, just because fear, hope, and remembrance add to the intensity of
                    consciousness, can the Epicurean hold that bodily pain and pleasure is a less
                    durable and important thing than pain and pleasure of mind. Whatever we feel to
                    affect us does affect us, and is therefore real. Error can only arise because we
                    mix up our opinions and suppositions with what we actually feel. The Epicurean
                    canonic is a rejection of logic; it sticks fast to the one point that “sensation
                    is sensation,” and there is no more to be made of it. Sensation, it says, is
                    unreasoning (άλογος); it must be accepted, and not criticised. Reasoning can
                    only come in to put sensations together, and to point out how they severally
                    contribute to human welfare; it does not make them, and cannot alter them.</p>
                <p>In the Epicurean physics we have two parts,—a general metaphysic and psychology,
                    and a special explanation of particular phenomena of nature. It is in this
                    department that we find exemplified the method of the founder. That method
                    consists in argument by analogy: we apply the process which we have learned in
                    some familiar instance to explain and rationalize for our own satisfaction some
                    obscure and distant process which we do not understand. It is an attempt to make
                    the phenomena of nature intelligible to us by regarding them as instances on a
                    grand scale of what we are already familiar with on a small. This is what
                    Epicurus calls explaining what we do not see by what we do see. It supposes us
                    to know and comprehend what we are familiar with, and assumes that to explain is
                    to substitute a process with which we are at home for one which we cannot
                    penetrate, but which, without contradicting any of the phenomena, may be
                    conceived to take place in a similar way.</p>
                <p>In physics Epicurus founded upon Democritus, and his chief object was to abolish
                    the dualism between mind and matter which is so essential a point in the systems
                    of Plato and Aristotle. All that exists, says Epicurus, is corporeal <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(to</hi> π⅛ εσ∙τι σώ/ζα); the intangible is non-existent, or
                    empty space. If a thing exists it must be felt, and to be felt it must exert
                    resistance. But all things are not intangible which our senses are not subtle
                    enough to detect. We must indeed accept our feelings; but we must also believe
                    much which is not directly testified by sensation, if only it does not
                    contravene our sensations and serves to explain phenomena. The fundamental
                    postulates of Epicureanism are atoms and the void. We must believe, according to
                    him, that space is infinite, and that there is an illimitable multitude of
                    indestructible, indivisible, and absolutely compact atoms in perpetual motion in
                    this illimitable space. These atoms, differing only in size, figure, and weight,
                    are perpetually moving with equal velocities, but at a rate far surpassing our
                    conceptions; as they move, they are for ever giving rise to new worlds; and
                    these worlds are perpetually tending towards dissolution, and towards a fresh
                    series of creations. This universe of ours is only one section out of the
                    innumerable worlds in infinite space; other worlds may present systems very
                    different from the arrangement of sun, moon, and stars, which we see in this.
                    The soul of man is only a finer species of body, spread throughout the whole
                    aggregation which we term his bodily frame. Like a warm breath, it pervades the
                    human structure and works with it; nor could it act as it does in perception
                    unless it were corporeal. The various processes of sense, notably vision, are
                    explained on the principles of materialism. From the surfaces of all objects
                    there are continually flowing thin filmy images exactly copying the solid body
                    whence they originate; and these images by direct impact on the organism produce
                    (we need not care to ask how) the phenomena of vision. Epicurus in this way
                    explains vision by substituting for the apparent action of a body at a distance
                    a direct contact of image and organ. But without following the explanation into
                    the details in which it revels, it may be enough to say that the whole
                    hypothesis is but an attempt to exclude the occult conception of action at a
                    distance, and substitute a familiar phenomenon.</p>
                <p>This tendential character of the Epicurean physics becomes more palpable when we
                    look at his mode of rendering particular phenomena intelligible. His purpose is
                    to eliminate all ideas by which the grander phenomena of nature are popularly
                    attributed to Divine interference. That there are gods Epicurus never dreams of
                    denying; the feelings of human nature are too vivid which present to our mind’s
                    eye beings of perfect blessedness and unbroken tranquillity But these gods have
                    not on their shoulders the burden of upholding and governing the world. They are
                    themselves the products of the order of nature,—a higher species than humanity,
                    but not the rulers of man, neither the makers nor the upholders of the world.
                    Man should worship them, but his worship is the reverence due to the ideals of
                    perfect blessedness; it ought not to be inspired either by hope or by fear. To
                    prevent all reference of the more potent phenomena of nature to divine action
                    Epicurus rationalizes the processes of the cosmos. He imagines all possible
                    plans or hypotheses, not actually contradicted by our experience of familiar
                    events, which will represent in an intelligible way the processes of astronomy
                    and meteorology. When two or more modes of accounting for a phenomena are
                    equally admissible as not directly contradicted by known phenomena, it seems to
                    Epicurus almost a return to the old mythological habit of mind when a savant
                    asserts that the real cause is one and only one. Thus, after several
                    hypothetical accounts of how thunder may be brought about, he adds, “Thunder may
                    be explained in many <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n494/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0494-0475"/> other ways; only let us have no myths of divine
                    action. To assign only a single cause for these phenomena, when the facts
                    familiar to us suggest several, is insane, and is just the absurd conduct to be
                    expected from people who dabble in the vanities of astronomy” We need not be too
                    curious to inquire how these celestial phenomena actually do come about <hi
                    rend="italic">; we</hi> can learn how they might have been produced, and to go
                    further is to trench on ground beyond the limits of human knowledge.</p>
                <p>Thus, if Epicurus objects to the doctrine of mythology, he objects no less to the
                    doctrine of an inevitable fate, a necessary order of things unchangeable and
                    supreme over the human will. “Better were it,” he says, “to accept all the
                    legends of the gods than to make ourselves slaves to the fate of the natural
                    philosophers.” Fatalism, which was the doctrine of the Stoics, seemed to
                    Epicurus no less deadly a foe of man’s true welfare than popular superstition.
                    Even in the movement of the atoms he introduces a sudden change of direction,
                    which is supposed to render their aggregation easier, and to break the even law
                    of destiny. So, in the sphere of human action, Epicurus would allow of no
                    absolutely controlling necessity. There is much in our circumstances that
                    springs from mere chance, but it does not overmaster man. With a latent
                    optimism, Epicurus asserts that, though there are evils in the world, still
                    their domination is brief at the height, and there are many consoling
                    circumstances; while, on the other hand, it is easy to attain the maximum of
                    pleasure. The sphere of man’s action is marked by self determination , he need
                    own no master. “Better,” he says, “is the misfortune of the man who has planned
                    his way wisely, than the prosperity of him who lias devised foolishly.” In fact,
                    it iβ only when we assume for man this indepen denceof the gods and of fatality
                    that the Epicurean theory of life becomes possible It assumes that man can, like
                    the gods, withdraw himself out of reach of all external influences, and thus, as
                    a sage, “live like a god among men, seeing that the man is in no wise like a
                    mortal creature who lives in undying blessedness.” And this present life is the
                    only one. With one consent Epicureanism preaches that the death of the body is
                    the end of everything for man, and hence the other world has lost all its
                    terrors as well as all its hopes.</p>
                <p>The attitude of Epicurus in this whole matter is antagonistic to science. The
                    idea of a systematic enchainment of phenomena, in which each is conditioned by
                    every other, and none can be taken in isolation and explained apart from the
                    rest, was foreign to his mind. When that idea is embraced, then obviously the
                    whole group of phenomena must be taken into account in determining whether any
                    hypothesis will serve to explain a detached section. But so little was the
                    scientific conception of the solar system familiar to Epicurus that he could
                    reproach the astronomers, because their account of an eclipse represented things
                    otherwise than as they appear to the senses, and could declare that the sun and
                    stars were just as large as they seemed to us.</p>
                <p>The moral philosophy of Epicurus is the heir of the Cyrenaic doctrine that
                    pleasure is the good thing in life. Neither sect, it may be added, advocated
                    sensuality pure and unfeigned,—the Epicurean least of all. By pleasure Epicurus
                    meant both more and less than the Cyrenaics. To the Cyrenaics pleasure was of
                    moments; to Epicurus it extended as a habit of mind through life. To the
                    Cyrenaics pleasure was something active and positive; to Epicurus it was rather
                    negative,—tranquillity more than vigorous enjoyment. The test of true pleasure,
                    according to Epicurus, is the removal and absorption of all that gives pain; it
                    implies freedom from pain of body and from trouble of mind. The happiness of the
                    Epicurean was, it might almost seem, a grave and solemn pleasure— a quiet
                    unobtrusive ease of heart, but not exuberance and excitement. The Cyrenaic was a
                    buoyant and self-reliant nature, who lived in the light of a grander day in
                    Greece; and he plucked pleasures carelessly and lightly from the trees in the
                    garden of life as he passed through on his journey, without anxiety for the
                    future, or regret for the past. The sage <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of
                    Epicureanism is a rational and reflective seeker for happiness, who balances the
                    claims of each pleasure against the evils that may possibly ensue, and treads
                    the path of enjoyment cautiously, as befits “a sober reason which inquires
                    diligently into the grounds of acting or refraining from action, and which
                    banishes those prejudices from which spring the chief perturbation of the soul.”
                    Prudential wisdom is therefore the only means by which a truly happy life may be
                    attained; it is thus the chief excellence, and the foundation of all the
                    virtues. It is, in fact, says Epicurus,—in language which contrasts strongly
                    with that of Aristotle on the same topic—“a more precious power than
                    philosophy.” Pleasure still remains the end; but the natural instinct which
                    prompts to take any opportunity of enjoyment is held in check by the reflection
                    on consequences. The reason or intellect is introduced to measure pleasures—to
                    balance possible pleasures and pains—to construct a scheme in which pleasures
                    are the materials of a happy life. Feeling, which Epicurus declared to be the
                    means of determining what is good, is subordinated to a reason which adjudicates
                    between competing pleasures with the view of securing tranquillity of mind and
                    body. But to do so is no easy task; it makes the search for pleasure almost an
                    impossibility Epicurus is more clearly in the right when he expatiates on the
                    necessary interdependence of virtue and happiness: “We cannot live pleasantly
                    without living wisely and nobly and righteously” Virtue is at least a means of
                    happiness, though apart from that it is no good in itself, any more than mere
                    sensual enjoyments, which are good only because they may sometimes serve to
                    secure health of body and tranquillity of mind.</p>
                <p>The theory of Epicurus has no direct utilitarian tone. Its aim is the happiness
                    of the individual. But its selfishness is tempered by friendship. The only
                    duties which Epicurus recognizes are those which have been free <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> y accepted on rational grounds, not from the
                    compulsion of appetite or of circumstances. Thus the ideal of Epicurean society
                    was the friendly circle. The family and the state imposed, as he thought,
                    obligations which lessened the independence of man, and subjected him to
                    externals. “The sage,” he says, “will not marry and beget children, nor will he
                    take part in state affairs. Though holding but little by many conventionalities,
                    he will not assume a cynical or stoical indifference to others; he will not form
                    hard and fast judgments; he will not believe all sinners to be equally depraved,
                    nor all sages equally wise.” Friendship—like the state in its first origin—is
                    based upon utility; but in it our relations are less forced; and though its
                    motive be utility, still one must begin the good work of well-doing, even as the
                    husbandman first bestows his labour and wealth upon the soil from which he hopes
                    one day to receive fruit in return.</p>
                <p>Even in the lifetime of Epicurus we hear of the vast numbers of his friends, not
                    merely in Greece, but in Asia and Egypt. The crowds of Epicureans were a
                    standing enigma to the adherents of less popular sects. Cicero pondered over the
                    fact; Arcesilaus explained the secession to the Epicurean camp, compared with
                    the fact that no Epicurean was ever known to have abandoned his school, by
                    saying that, though it was possible for a man to be turned into a eunuch, no
                    eunuch could ever become a man. But the phenomenon was not obscure. The doctrine
                    has many <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n495/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0495-0476"/> truths, and attracts most natures in some of its
                    parts, especially in an age of religious scepticism. Besides, Epicureanism
                    resembled a church more than a philosophical school. It was not very systematic,
                    but very dogmatic. To develop it would have been to destroy it, for its great
                    point was to hold fast to certain principles of common sense. The dogmas of
                    Epicurus became to his followers a creed em bodying the truths on which
                    salvation depended; and they passed on from one generation to another with
                    scarcely a change or addition.</p>
                <p>The immediate disciples of Epicurus have been already mentioned, with the
                    exception of Colotes. In the 2nd century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Apollodorus and Zeno of Sidon taught at Athens. About 150 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Epicureanism established itself at Rome. Beginning with C. Amafinius,
                    we find the names of Phaedrus and Philodemus as distinguished Epicureans in the
                    time of Cicero. But the greatest of its Roman names was Lucretius, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">herum Natura</hi> embodies the main
                    teaching of Epicurus with great exactness, and with a beauty which the subject
                    seemed scarcely to allow. Lucretius is a proof, if any were needed, that
                    Epicureanism is compatible with nobility of soul. In the 1st century of the
                    Christian era, the nature of the time, with its active political struggles,
                    naturally called Stoicism more into the foreground; yet Seneca, though nominally
                    a Stoic, draws nearly all his suavity and much of his paternal wisdom from the
                    writings of Epicurus. The position of Epicureanism as a recognized school in the
                    2nd century is best seen in the fact that it was one of the four schools (the
                    others were the Stoic, Platonist, and Peripatetic) which were placed on a
                    footing of equal endowment when Marcus Aurelius founded chairs of philosophy at
                    Athens. The evidence of Diogenes proves that it still subsisted as a school a
                    century later, but its spirit lasted longer than its formal organisation as a
                    school. A great deal of the best of the Renaissance was founded on
                    Epicureanism.</p>
                <p>The chief ancient account of Epicurus is to be found in the 10th book of Diogenes
                    Laertius, in Lucretius, and in several treatises of Cicero and Plutarch.

                    by Epi. curus, and several members of his school. The fragments of the second
