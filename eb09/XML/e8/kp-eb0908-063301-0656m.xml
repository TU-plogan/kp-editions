                    reached their permanent seats in Etruria proper is by no means certain, though
                    from the fact of their principal towns being well inland, from the tradition of
                    their having been previously settled in Umbria, from the survival of their
                    peculiar language down to late times among a people of the Rhaetian Alps, and
                    from the discovery of works of art in this district corresponding with the
                    earliest Etruscan remains, there would seem to be considerable probability in
                    the theory of their first settlement in Italy having been about the mouth of the
                    Po, whence their progress would be through Umbria and across the Apennines. At
                    the same time, it is to be remembered that, though “Rasena” was the national
                    name of this people, yet there is strong evidence for supposing that the
                    nationality, as we know it under the classical names of Etrusci or Tyrrheni <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ύνρρηνοί, Ύυρσηνυί),</hi> included another race which, if not
                    nearly allied to the Greeks, had a singularly similar disposition towards the
                    arts, such as it is hardly possible the original Rasena could have brought with
                    them directly from the north. It would account for this other race, if we could
                    accept the tradition (Herodotus, i. 94, Strabo, v. 220) of a body of Lydians
                    having landed in Umbria and colonized Etruria, naming it after their leader
                    Tyrsenus. This Lydian origin was accepted by the Etruscans themselves in late
                    times (Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> iv. 55), and many have seen a
                    confirmation of it in the similarity of the tombs and <hi rend="italic"
                    >tumuli</hi> existing in both countries, and in the records of a singular
                    community between them in such matters as music, games, and costume.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare the tomb of Alyattes,
                    still existing, and described by Herodotus (i. 93), with that of Cucumella at
                    Vulci. Tradition said that the Lydian trumpet and the Phrygian double flute had
                    been introduced into Rome from Etruria; that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >proetexta</hi> or oflicial robes, the eagle as a standard, and the game of dice
                    had been brought from Lydia to Etruria. Livy (iv. 17) tells how Lars Tolumnius
                    determined, by means of dice, the fate of the Roman ambassadors who were sent to
                    him at Veil (c/’. Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rorn.,</hi> xxxiii.); and Festus (s. v. “Sardi”) mentions the custom according
                    to which, on occasions of sacrifice for victory at Rome, an old man, dressed in
                    purple, was led to the Capitol, attended by a herald, who proclaimed “Sardians
                    to be sold;” and they explain this custom as having survived from the sale of
                    prisoners after the capture of Veii, which prisoners were Sardians, since
                    Etruria had been colonized by Sardians. This custom, however, seems rather to
                    have originated after the hiking of Sardinia by Tib. Sempronius
                    Gracchus.</p></note> Yet a native historian of Lydia (Xanthus) said nothing of
                    the emigration from that country, and Dionysius, who cites him, maintained that
                    the language spoken in Etruria had nothing in common with that of Lydia. The
                    legend of Herodotus is an attempt to explain the name of “Tyrrhenia” as applied
                    by the Greeks to Etruria, owing, doubtless, to its being largely inhabitated by
                    members of that same Tyrrhenian race which was found on the coast of Asia Minor
                    and in Thrace, which people Thucydides (iv. 109) identifies with the Pelasgians,
                    while Herodotus himself (i.57)speaks of the Tyrrhenian town of Creston, by which
                    he means Cortona in Etruria according to Dionysius, as Pelasgic. Another
                    tradition asserted that Pelasgians from Thessaly had entered Italy from the
                    Adriatic at Spina and founded Cortona. While then the Tyrrhenians and Pelasgians
                    were practically the same people, it will be sufficient to use the former name
                    to designate the apparently foreign element in the nationality of the Rasena. In
                    historical times the chief seat of the Tyrrhenians outside of Etruria was in
                    Thrace, where they worked the rich silver mines, and to judge from their coins
                    <hi rend="italic">(f.g.,</hi> those of the Edones and Bisaltae) were gifted with
                    much the same disposition towards fine art which is observed in Etruria. From
                    this position in a northern region, and from the traditions of members of the
                    same race having entered Italy from the north-east, it is not unreasonable to
                    suppose that they may have gradually made their way round by land, and may, in
                    fact, have joined the Rasena while they were yet in their settlements at the
                    mouth of the Po. So complete a blending of two races a» appears in the Etrusci
                    could scarcely take place unless the original contact had been during a
                    primitive stage of civilization. No doubt there were other Tyrrhenians besides
                    those of Thrace. There were those who were known chiefly as pirates, or as
                    successful in seafaring, and from the circumstance of Caere, which previously
                    had the Tyrrhenian name of Agylla, having been near the coast, it would seem as
                    if part at least of the Tyrrhenians had entered Etruria by sea on the west
                    coast.</p>
                <p>It is common enough to find mention of the twelve cities of Etruria, but nowhere
                    are their respective names recorded.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n657/mode/1up"

                <p>The probability is that in process of time this or that city fell out of the
                    league, and was replaced by towns of more recent growth, till in the end there
                    were at least seventeen presumable claimants for the title of one of the twelve.
                    This is the case as regards Etruria proper, but there was a time when similar
                    leagues appear to have existed among the Etruscan cities in the neighbourhood of
                    the Po (Etruria Circumpadana), and again among those of Campania. As to the
                    confederation of twelve cities in Etruria proper, and the political principles
                    on which it was founded, nothing is positively known, except that the principles
                    were essen tially aristocratic, much as in early Rome under the kings. The kings
                    were elective for life, and were held in check by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principes</hi> or Lucumos who represented the real power of each state. In
                    national enterprises one of the kings was chosen for supreme command, having a
                    lictor from each city. The surroundings of official dignity found afterwards in
                    Rome, the purple robe, the praetexta, the twelve lictors and fasces, the
                    apparitores, the curule chair, and triumphal processions, were derived from
                    Etruria, and in dicate the nature of her constitution. The representatives met
                    at the temple of Voltumna, the locality of which is not known (Livy, iv. 23),
                    apparently in spring; but it would seem that, in fact, the confederation was far
                    from strictly maintained, at any rate in the matter of external policy. For
                    internal affairs they had certain books <hi rend="italic">{libri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">disciplinae Etruscae)</hi> in which they were instructed as to the
                    founding and consecration of public or religious buildings, the distribution of
                    the people into tribes, curiae and centuriae, the constitution of armies, and
                    the management of everything pertaining to peace or war (Festus, s. v. “Rituales
                    ”). These books were divided into three sections, the third, <hi rend="italic"
                    >libri rituales,</hi> being those to which reference has just been made. The
                    other two were devoted to divination, an art in which the Etruscans surpassed
                    all other nations. The first part was the <hi rend="italic">libri
                    haruspicini,</hi> containing instructions for divining the will of the gods from
                    abnormal conditions observed in the entrails of animals slain in sacrifice, or
                    from unusual natural phenomena. The second part was the <hi rend="italic">libri
                    fulgurales,</hi> treating of divination from lightning. By such means the gods
                    were believed to indicate their wishes towards men, and, indeed, had declared so
                    much through the divine seer, Tages, a miraculous dwarf whom a labourer
                    ploughing one day found in his furrow. Though then but a boy, Tages had grey
                    hair, and was wise as if of a great age. His sayings, delivered always in verse,
                    like oracles, were taken down by Tarchon, and formed the books in question.
                    Tarchon was the founder of Tarquinii, and from this town proceeded the other
                    cities and their organization. Such is the legend, and in the early history of
                    Etruria we have, as elsewhere, only legend, known mainly through the annals of
                    Rome, which, when they go back to a period before the introduction of writing
                    (apparently in the 7th century. <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> must be largely
                    imaginary, and cven long after this, are highly coloured.</p>
                <p>First in importance among the Etruscan cities was <hi rend="italic">Veil,</hi>
                    the site of which has been identified at Isola Farnese, about 11 miles from
                    Rome, its great rival and ultimate victor. Strong by its natural position on a
                    high cliff, and fortified with massive walls, rich in its own territory, and
                    commanding the assistance of its subject towns, Sabata, Sutrium, Nepete, and
                    Capena, it maintained an almost constant state of war with Rome from the
                    legendary times of Romulus down to its capture by Camillus, 396 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> after which, by a decree of the Roman senate, it was
                    forbidden to be inhabited (Livy, v. 6). The spoils then carried away indicated
                    its wealth, and doubtless this, together with other measures then taken, led to
                    the desolation which now reigns on the site. Of the 14 recorded wars with Rome,
                    the most memora"ble were—the 7th (509 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), in which,
                    to replace Tarquinius Superbus on the throne of that city, Porsena of Clusium
                    marched to its gates, though in a previous battle the Etruscans had been
                    declared vanquished by a mysterious voice in the night, because they had lost
                    one man more than the Romans; the 9th and 10th (482-476 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), in which occurred the treacherous massacre of the Fabii, who, with
                    their clients, to the number, it is said, of 4000, had voluntered to hold Veil
                    in check from their camp on the Cremera; the 12th, in which their king Tolumnius
                    was slain, and the 14th, in which the Romans, to whose gates the Veientes had so
                    often carried terror, laid seige to Veii, and in the tenth year took it, as is
                    said by the stratagem of a cuniculus or mine up through the rock of the citadel.
                    Those who believe this story, point out that Camillus may have obtained his idea
                    from the <hi rend="italic">cuniculus</hi> or outlet of the waters of the Alban
                    lake, which also at this time was made to play a miraculous part. The waters of
                    the lake were observed with alarm to be rising and threatening to overflow. The
                    oracle at Delphi was consulted, and in consequence of its advice this outlet was
                    made by the Romans in the space of a year (Livy, v. 15, 16).</p>
                <p>Scarcely less important than Veii, and like it also undoubtedly one of the twelve
                    cities, was <hi rend="italic">Tarquinii,</hi> now Corneto, the queen of the
                    Maremma, towards which Graviscae seems to have served as the port by which its
                    great trade was carried on. The story runs that among those who preferred exile
                    to the tyranny of Cypselus in Corinth in the early part of the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was a wealthy merchant, Demaratus, who,· accompanied
                    by certain artists with mythical names (Eucheir, Diopus, and Eugrammus), settled
                    in Tarquinii, which it is to be presumed was then sufficiently advanced in
                    civilization to offer prospects of comfort, and to have been known to the
                    traders of Corinth at least. Demaratus married a lady of Tarquinii, and had a
                    son Lucumo or Lucius, who, though rich, suffered from being looked down on as a
                    foreigner, and, to escape this, migrated to Rome, where in time he rose to the
                    highest office of king, under the title of Tarquinius Priscus, and compelled the
                    submission of the whole of Etruria, the token of which was the insignia of the
                    twelve fasces, representing the twelve cities. He was succeeded by Servius
                    Tullius, or Mastarna, as the Etruscans called him, under whose rule Etruria
                    revolted, but without final success. Then came Tarquinius Superbus and his
                    expulsion from Rome, on which occasion Tarquinii and Veii sent an army to
                    endeavour to reinstate him. In the battle which followed, Aruns Tarquinius and
                    Junius Brutus the first consul fell by each other’s hands. From this time
                    Tarquinii was quiet for a century, till 397 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when
                    it joined Veii against Rome unsuccessfully, and thus revived a series of wars,
                    in which, though generally worsted with severe loss, she yet maintained her
                    independence down to the defeat at the Vadimonian lake, 283 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Towards the close of the second Punic war, when the Etruscan cities
                    had to furnish Scipio’s fleet each with its staple commodity, Tarquinii supplied
                    sail-cloth.</p>
                <p>Corn and other provisions were supplied by <hi rend="italic">Caere,</hi> a town
                    which, if less famous in war than the two already described, was better known in
                    the arts of peace. No doubt, in the legendary age, when it was ruled by the
                    cruel Mezentius <hi rend="italic">(Aeneid,</hi> viii. 482), it was sufficiently
                    warlike, but in later times it rarely joined in the stnιggles against Rome,
                    where, indeed, its people stood in high favour for having sheltered the Roman
                    vestals and the Flamen Quirinalis from the Gauls (389 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> From the privileges enjoyed by the Caerites in Rome arose, it was
                    said, the’word “caerimonia.” It is recorded to the honour of Caere that she
                    abstained from the piracy <pb break="no"

                    v. 220); and it is a proof both of her advancement in civilization and of her
                    reputation among the Greeks that she had a treasury at Delphi, where it was
                    known as the treasury of Agylla, such having been the original name of the city.
                    How the change of name arose is accounted for (Strabo, v. 220) with the
                    ingenuity characteristic of ancient derivations. Agylla had been founded by
                    Pelasgians from Thessaly, but was afterwards captured by the Tyrrhenians from
                    Lydia (cf. <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> v. 479), who, having enquired the name
                    of the town they were besieging, and having been answered by some one from the
                    walls with a word which they took to be the Greek χα7pe, adopted this as the new
                    name of the city. Herodotus (i. 167) speaks of it as Agylla, and relates how it
                    joined the Carthaginians against the Phocaeans of Alalia in Corsica (about 534
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and, having carried away its share of the booty
                    and of the prisoners, put the latter to death. Upon this followed a plague, as
                    to which the Agyllaeans consulted the oracle at Delphi, and were told in reply
                    that the way to appease the Phocaeans would be to institute public festivals of
                    athletic games and horse-racing. The sea-port was Pyrgi, celebrated also for the
                    wealth of its temple of Eileithyia, which Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse,
                    ransacked (384 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), taking from it 1000 talents, and
                    spoils to the value of 500 talente more. As evidence of the high antiquity of
                    the arts in Caere, there is the statement of Pliny (xxxv. 4-6) that paintings
                    existed there older than the foundation of Rome. It was said to have been the
                    last refuge of the Tarquins, and in confirmation of this is the modern discovery
                    of a large sepulchre belonging to a family of that name, as seen from the
                    numerous inscriptions in it. Little remains except <hi rend="italic">tumuli</hi>
                    and sepulchres, among which the most famous is that known as the

                <p>In close political relationship to Veii, and probably reckoned as one of the
                    twelve cities, though its population (theFalisci) was not purely Etruscan, was
                    <hi rend="italic">FalerH,</hi> originally on a high bare rock, but afterwards
                    under Roman compulsion transferred to the broad plain which stretches to the
                    Tiber, the Aequum Faliscum as it was called, to indicate the plain, not the
                    justice of the people. The very ancient Fescennium seems to have been included
                    in its territory. Trusting in its natural strength, Falerii vainly made light of
                    the Roman siege conducted by Camillus (391 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> It
                    was on this occasion, as told by Livy (v. 27), that an official of Falerii, to
                    whom was entrusted the education of the sons of the better class, led his pupils
                    outside the city for their exercises as in times of peace, and by daily
                    increasing the distance of their walks avoided suspicion, till at last he
                    reached the Roman camp and offered to surrender the boys to Camillus, who,
                    indignant at the treachery of the man, ordered him to be stripped, bound, and
                    handed over to his pupils to be led back and punished. The habit of appointing
                    an official of this kind is spoken of as a Greek one, and, in connexion with the
                    legendary foundation of Falerii by Halesus or Haliscus, a son of Agamemnon,
                    together with the fact of its temple of Juno being the counterpart of the temple
                    of that goddess at Argos, is taken as evidence of a strong Greek element in the
                    town. Strabo (v. 226) quotes the opinion of some that the Falisci were not
                    Tyrrhenians, but a distinct nationality,</p>
                <p>One of the twelve cities also was <hi rend="italic">Volci</hi> (Vulci)
                    apparently, though the historical notices of it are but few, and leave no
                    impression of any great power. Yet its remains, as discovered in numerous
                    sepulchres, show that it must have been an important city. Of these the tumulus
                    of Cucumella, as it is now called, is remarkable not only for its size (200 feet
                    in diameter, and 40 to 50 feet high still), but also for its general similarity
                    to the tomb of Porsena at Clusium, of which we have only the description as
                    quoted by Pliny (xxxvi. 13, 19), and to the tomb of Alyattes in Lydia. Up to
                    1830 this tomb at Vulci was encircled round the base with a massive wall, which
                    is now gone. In the heart of the mound were discovered two loosely built towers,
                    one of them square, the other conical, which perhaps may be fairly compared with
                    the pillars in the tomb of Porsena and the <hi rend="italic">οvροι</hi> in that
                    of Alyattes. From the other sepulchres of Vulci has been obtained a vast number
                    of antiquities, not a few of which are of the first importance for the history
                    of art in Etruria, and will be afterwards referred to. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volsinii,</hi> called by the Etruscans Felsuna, as appears from its coinage,
                    and now Bυlsena, was one of the most powerful and warlike of the Etruscan
                    states. The original site, it has been thought, was at Orvieto, which the Romans
                    after a long and arduous siege destroyed, compelling the Volsinii to settle on
                    the low ground at Bolsena. <hi rend="italic">Clusium</hi> (Chiusi), originally
                    Camars (Livy, X. 25), had been founded by the Umbrians, but became one of the
                    principal cities of Etruria, being apparently at the height of its fame under
                    the rule of its king Porsena, who to reinstate Tarquinius Priscus made that
                    march to Rome (505 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> with which are associated the
                    undying legends of Roman heroism in the persons of Horatius, Scaevola, Cloelia,
                    and Publicola (Livy, ii. 11-13). Before this we find Clusium joined with other
                    Etruscan cities on the side of the Latins against Tarquinius Priscus. Afterwards
                    it was the assistance given by Rome to Clusium which drew down the Gauls on the
                    former in 389 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> At the close of the second Punic
                    war Clusium furnished corn and fir for ship-building to the Roman fleet. Mention
                    has been made of the tomb of Porsena said to have existed at Clusium. In one
                    place labyrinthine passages have been found among the tombs, such as appear to
                    correspond to one of the features in the description of that sepulchre. <hi
                    rend="italic">Arretium</hi> (Arezzo) was one of the twelve cities, but famous
                    chiefly in comparatively recent times. In 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    citizens rose against the tyranny of their great family, the Cilnii, and drove
                    them to exile in Rome, where their cause was taken up with this practical
                    result, that a Roman army defeated the Arretines at Russellae. Afterwards the
                    city joined in league with theGauls and Umbrians against Rome, but again was
                    defeated. Next it was besieged by the Gauls. There is no record of its final
                    submission to Rome. In the second Punic war it furnished corn, implements, and
                    material of war for the Roman fleet. During the civil wars it took the side of
                    Marius, and would in consequence have lost all rights but for the intercession
                    of Cicero. Tl·e present site does not appear to be that of the ancient town. Of
                    its walls, which were said to have been built of brick, there is no trace.
                    Conspicuous still for its stupendous walls and towers, commanding a high bare
                    rock, is <hi rend="italic">Cortona,</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> where
                    everything that remains is in harmony with the tradition of its extraordinary
                    autiquity. Of other records there are scarcely any. Like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perusia</hi> (Perugia) it had once been an Umbrian city, and likc it also one
                    of the twelve states of Etruria. Parts of the walls of Perusia remain, and many
                    objects of great interest have been found on its site, none more precious,
                    however, than the “Cippus of Perugia,” with its long Etruscan inscription.
                    Perusia comes first into notice arrayed against Fabius, who compelled her to sue
                    for peace. In the following year she was again at war, and shared in the
                    disaster at the λ adi-monian lake. Other defeats followed, but not even that in
                    which Fabius slew 4500 of her men, and took 1740 prisoners, was sufficient to
                    reduce her to obedience to Rome, though that event followed not long after. In
                    the second Punic war she supplied corn and fir to the Roman fleet. In the civil
                    wars she took an active part, and when besieged by Octavius Caesar yielded only
                    to famine. A great fire <pb break="no"

                    Augustus. Even under the empire it maintained a position of importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Volaterrae,</hi> called Velathri on its coinage, and now
                    Volterra, of which the massive walls from 4 to 5 miles in circuit still stand on
                    a great bare height visible far round, appears to have been one of the twelve
                    cities, notwithstanding the fact of its having taken part with the Latins
                    against Tarquinius Priscus. Almost nothing, however, is known of its history
                    except the record of a defeat (298 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> inflicted by
                    L. Cornelius Scipio (Livy, x. 12), the battle having raged all day till darkness
                    set in. The Etruscans deserted their camp in the night. Though considerably
                    inland, Volaterrae is cited as having supplied tackling and other gear for
                    Scipio’s fleet, from which it would appear that she had been maritime, trading
                    probably in the main through the port of Populonia, which is said to have been
                    colonized by her Possibly also the island of Elba with its rich mines belonged
                    to Volaterrae. Its territory was extensive. During the civil wars it took the
                    side of Marius, and after a siege of two years had to surrender, and only for a
                    time escaped having to receive a military colony through the exertions of
                    Cicero. Besides the walls there remain still several sepulchres of great
                    interest, in par ticular that of the Caecinae family, famous in Roman history,
                    and the ruins of two dome-shaped chambers, resembling in their construction the
                    so-called tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae. <hi rend="italic">Populonia,</hi> called
                    <hi rend="italic">Pupluηa</hi> on its coins, furnished iron obtained from the
                    mines of Elba for Scipio’s fleet. During the civil war it was destroyed by
                    Sulla. Parts of the walls of huge masonry remain. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Russellae</hi> (Roselle) still survives in its walls of colossal masonry, but
                    otherwise is a wilderness. Its history is uneventful, except for its siege by
                    the Romans (294 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), when it lost 2000 as prisoners
                    and as many more slain (Livy, x. 37). It furnished corn and fir for the fleet of
                    Scipio. <hi rend="italic">Vetulonia</hi> is given as one of the twelve cities,
                    but little is known of it from records, and scarcely anything from remains, if,
                    as appears to be the case, Mr Dennis is right in identifying its site on the
                    coast near Telamone, which he presumes would have been its port. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pisae,</hi> on the coast, was said to have been founded by Tarchon
                    as a barrier against the Ligurians. Luna and Luca were probably included in its
                    territory. Of <hi rend="italic">Faesuloe</hi> the huge walls on an impregnable
                    height still remain. In Roman times the inhabitants moved to the lower ground of
                    Florence. At Cosa and Saturnia are remains of massive walls, and at the latter
                    place a peculiar form of tomb, which seems to date from a very early and at any
                    rate a rude age. <hi rend="italic">Salpenum</hi> and Λwr⅛i&lt;ι are mentioned
                    also among the Etruscan cities. Outside of Etruria proper, but still claiming to
                    be Etruscan towns, we have, in Etruria Circumpadana, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Felsiηi,</hi> afterwards called <hi rend="italic">Bononia,</hi> said to have
                    been at the head of the league formed by this district, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Melpnm, Mantua, Spina, Ravenna, Hatrιa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cupra.</hi>
                    In Campania again were the following cities which Etruria was said to have
                    founded or sent colonists to, but without the effect of making them practically
                    Etruscan towns :— <hi rend="italic">Capua, Hola, Pompeii, Herculaneum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Surrentum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Marcina,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Salernum.</hi></p>
                <p>These, then, are the towns of Etruria. In their records and in their ruins they
                    survive as monuments of a life spent in extraordinary activity, and highly
                    honoured in death. No country has left such wealth in its tombs. Nowhere have
                    such battlements endured till now. Nature must have largely aided the Etruscans
                    with her fertility, where now she is either exuberant to the degree of being a
                    wilderness or pestilential as in the Maremma. Evidence of its natural products
                    has been seen in the corn, fir wood, and iron, supplied to the Roman fleet. Its
                    rivers and lakes must have assisted agriculture (“sic fortis Etruria crevit,”
                    Virg., <hi rend="italic">Georg.,</hi> ii. 533), on which the country appears to
                    have relied even more than on commerce, since with a large sea coast it had
                    comparatively few ports. The exceeding unhealthiness of the coast district
                    anciently as now may have had much to do with this result. Yet their commerce
                    was such as to place the inhabitants in a position to make treaties with that
                    powerful nation of traders the Carthaginians, as, for instance, in the mutual
                    agreement that the latter should hold Sardinia, while the Etruscans retained
                    Corsica. To the Athenian expedi tion against Sicily in the Peloponnesian war
                    Etruria sent three ships, probably more from enmity to Sicily than from
                    friendship to the Athenians. Their success in piracy was too well known in early
                    times. The greater part of the country is broken up by chains and ridges of
                    hills. The supply of timber was large, and doubtless profitable, as were also
                    the pastures, from which a considerable trade in cattle rearing and wool
                    spinning was derived. The numerous lakes—Lacus Ciminius, Sabatinus,
                    Vadi-monius,Clusinus, Thrasymenus,and Volsinius withits basalt rocks, afforded
                    extensive occupation in fishing, as did the forests for hunting. Wine, largely
                    produced, was nowhere so fine as at Luna. Flax and linen were grown at Falerii
                    and Tarquinii. Besides iron and copper, there was a supply of silver and gold.
                    The variegated marble of Luna was greatly prized. Volaterrae yielded alabaster,
                    Arretium a clay peculiarly adapted for pottery, for which in later times it was
                    celebrated. Tufa or travertine could be obtained in massive blocks from many
                    places. There were numerous warm and sulphurous springs. The country had once
                    been volcanic in many places, the extinct cratere serving as basins for lakes.
                    The most fertile and most highly cultivated districts were in the north at the
                    foot of the Apennines, and along the upper valleys of the Arno and Tiber. The
                    chief rivers were the Clanis, the Arnus (Arno), and the Umbro.</p>
                <p>During the early period the natural resources of Etruria must have been severely
                    drained by her ware with Rome. Afterwards, when she sank into dependence, there
                    arose private wealth, and the individual Etruscan became <hi rend="italic"
                    >pinguis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">ol)esus,</hi> an
                    expression which is abundantly verified by the portrait sculptures on their
                    sarcophagi. Their extravagance in diet was a reproach, and in connexion with
                    this their habit of reclining at banquets, as constantly seen in their works of
                    art, was remarked on as similar to that of the Greeks; while the presence on
                    these occasions of women who joined in the toasts, contrary to the customs of
                    the Greeks and the Italic nations, was pointed out as consistent with the origin
                    of the Etruscans from Lydia, where no less indulgence was said to have been
                    allowed to women, and where also, as in Etruria, it was very usual to trace
                    descent from the maternal side Etruscan dancers, who appear to have attended
                    private as well as public ceremonies, were distinguished for the skill with
                    which, without words, and only by action and gesture, they represented a story.
                    Different from this may have been the armed dance, sinqe it recalls that of the
                    Salii in Rome, who accompanied their movements by songs of heroic deeds of old.
                    Athletic contests, such as those of the Roman circus, together with displays of
                    gladiatorial fights, were part of the amusements, and it seems almost certain
                    that the latter form of excitement was derived by Rome from Etruria. The flute,
                    trumpet, and <hi rend="italic">lituus</hi> were the favourite musical
                    instruments. Their literature consisted mainly of religious verses and national
                    songs, of which, however, nothing is known. To these must be added the form of
                    satyric songs which originated in Fescennium, a place belonging to Etruria. In
                    science, especially in medicine, and in philosophy their knowledge was <pb

                    lunar months, and appear to have had some principle of intercalation, to
                    equalize the solar and the lunar year. The lapse of each year was recorded by
                    driving a nail into the door of the temple of Nortia at Volsinii, a habit which
                    passed over to Rome. The month was divided into weeks of eight days, the eighth
                    being set apart for marketing and house affairs; the day began at noon. Next to
                    years they counted by <hi rend="italic">scecula,</hi> each representing the
                    longest life of the time, and reaching in some cases to 123 years, but with an
                    average apparently of about 100 years. The Etruscan nation was to endure ten
                    saecula. The beginning of the 10th was announced in the year 44 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The festivity of the Etruscans was accompanied by
                    excess in personal ornaments and in dress; the toga picta, tunica palmata, the
                    praetexta, the corona Etrusca, and the rich sandals which figured in Rome as
                    insignia of office, had been introduced from Etruria, where also no doubt they
                    served to mark the <hi rend="italic">principes</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >lucumones</hi> as distinct from the mass of the people to whose lot it is in
                    the highest degree improbable that such luxury as has been spoken of could bave
                    fallen. Their food was pulse, which may have been sweeter at Volsinii from being
                    ground in curiously contrived mills <hi rend="italic">(rnolae versatiles)</hi>
                    of basalt (Pliny, xxxvi. 18, 29). Clientship, developed to the full in Rome, had
                    first been proved practicable in Etruria, as was also the employment of slaves.
                    The division of the people into three <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi> and twelve
                    <hi rend="italic">curice</hi> at Mantua has been taken as representing the
                    general principle of division, and this would seem to be confirmed by the
                    tradition of the three names of Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres having been adopted
                    for the Roman <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi> from Etruria. To the books of
                    discipline, by which public and private affairs were regulated, reference has
                    already been made. There appears to have been also a fourth section of these
                    books, <hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">fatales,</hi> dealing with
                    common incidents. The interpretation of all these books and the conduct of such
                    ceremonies as they prescribed belonged exclusively to the noble families, some
                    of which had hereditary rights to the priesthood. In each state were always ten
                    boys of such families undergoing instruction for this purpose. But besides the
                    regular societies or colleges of Haruspices to which the Romans sent for aid
                    when perplexed by serious portents, there were apparently others who obtained a
                    vicarious living by ministering to the all-pervading superstition of the people.
                    Instead of an oracle common to the whole nation as the Greeks had at Delphi,
                    each state or city of Etruria had its own complicated machinery for discovering
                    the will of the gods. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Augurs.)</hi> Certain deities
                    revealed their will by lightning, others otherwise.</p>
                <p>The gods <hi rend="italic">(oesar)</hi> were of two classes, the Dû' <hi
                    rend="italic">Consentes,</hi> who directly managed the affairs of the world, and
                    certain nameless deities above and controlling them in such a way as Fate is
                    above Zeus in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> At the head of the former was
                    Jupiter (called <hi rend="italic">Tinia</hi> in Etruscan), with whom were
                    àssociated Juno <hi rend="italic">(Uni)</hi> and Minerva <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Meηrfα),</hi> forming a supremacy of three for the protection of states, as
                    may be inferred from the legend of Tarquinius having adopted them as the three
                    chief deities of Rome. Their functions, however, were in each case different
                    from those of the corresponding divinities of Rome and Greece, Jupiter being at
                    once ruler of all in peace, god of war, and source of fertility in the earth,
                    while Juno similarly was worshipped as “regina” in Veii, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >curitis,</hi> an armed goddess, at Falerii, and as associated with Vulcan at
                    Perusia, thus taking the place of the Greek Aphrodite and representing
                    fertility. Minerva, again, was winged besides being armed, had the functions of
                    Fortuna or Fate, and from her symbol of the serpent was a deity of the powers of
                    the earth. The Etruscan name of Venus was <hi rend="italic">Turan,</hi> of ∖
                    ulcan, <hi rend="italic">Sethlaηs,</hi> of Bacchus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phnρhluηs,</hi> of Mercury, <hi rend="italic">Turms.</hi> Besides the other
                    Greek deities who were in one way or another adopted into the Etruscan system,
                    such as Apollo, Helios, Ares, Poseidon, Heracles, and the Dioscuri, a number of
                    names have been handed down, some of which obviously designate gods of Latin or
                    Sabine origin, while others may be synonyms of one and the same deity obtaining
                    in different localities. The list includes Janus, Silvanus, Inuus, Saturnus,
                    Summanus, Vejovis, Soranus, Mantus, Pales, Nortia, Feronia, Voltumna, Mania,
                    Eileithyia, Horta, Ancharia, Fortuna, Ceres, and others. To these were attached
                    numerous genii of various powers and functions. As ruler of the lower world was
                    the grim god Mantus with his hammer, and his associates Mania, Charun, and the
                    Furiae. Among the Lares Familiares were included the shades of deceased persons.
                    The Penates watched over household plenty and prosperity. A goddess of Fate who
                    occurs frequently on the monuments is Lasa, probably a feminine derivative from
                    Lar, ruler, as in Lars Porsena. From what combination of early races, or from
                    what promiscuous habit of adopting foreign deities, this complicated system
                    arose cannot now be decided.</p>
                <p>For these gods temples were necessary, but in no case have they survived. Yet
                    from records it would seem that they differed from those of Greece in no
                    essential particular except in the ground plan, which, instead of being much
                    greater in length than in breadth, was nearly square, to be in conformity with
                    the <hi rend="italic">templum</hi> or arbitrary division of the heavens
                    prescribed by the sacred books. The theatres have been more fortunate, as at
                    Fiesole, where the massive ruins still show how in this form of construction
                    also the Etruscans had been indebted to the Greeks. Of amphitheatres or circi
                    there are no remains. There is, however, one form of construction in which they
                    are allowed to have been first, that is the arch, as seen among other places
                    best of all in the <hi rend="italic">Cloaca</hi> of Rome, the building of which
                    tradition regularly assigned to the Etruscans in the time of the Roman kings.
                    How the perfect arch was developed may be seeu from the apparent vaulting in the
                    Regulini-Galassi tomb at Cervetri and elsewhere, a system of masonry which the
                    Etruscans had in common with the builders of the so-called Tomb of Agamemnon at
                    Mycenae. The earliest tombs seem to be those in the form of a well, sunk in the
                    ground and lined with stones, containing a vase with the ashes and burnt remains
                    of the dress and ornaments of the deceased. In this early period cremation
                    appears to have been the rule, if, indeed, it was not always more or less a
                    favourite form of sepulture. Next we have two classes of tombs. First the <hi
                    rend="italic">tumuli,</hi> consisting of chambers encircled by a massive wall,
                    and covered with a mound of earth corresponding to the tumulus of Alyattes in
                    Lydia and other parts of Asia Minor, as well as to the Nuraghe of Sardinia. Of
                    this general type doubtless was the tomb of Porsena at Clusium, in spite of the
                    probably fantastic description of it already referred to. Its labyrinthine
                    chambers have been identified. The tumulus of Cucumella at Vulci has also been
                    mentioned Then we have tombs hewn in the rock, sometimes including several
                    chambers connected with each other, and frequently adorned, like those of Lycia,
                    with architectural fronts as of small temples. In these chambers were placed the
                    sarcophagi and urns, for the most part richly sculptured, in general with
                    subjects of design adapted from the Greeks, and having frequently on the lids
                    reclining figures intended either as portraits or in some other way to represent
                    the deceased, whose name and descent are painted on the front. In many cases the
                    walls of those chambers are richly decorated with paintings, not exclusively but
                    mostly reproducing scenes of festivity. The dead were accompanied in their
                    resting-place by numerous <pb break="no"

                    objects. As a rule a special district or cemetery was set apart for the dead,
                    but how far it was laid out so as to correspond with the quarters of each town
                    cannot now be determined. For the construction of the dwelling-houses and Tuscan
                    architecture generally see <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture,</hi> vol. ii., p.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">[Language.</hi> —By Etruscan is meant the language which was
                    spoken by the Rιsena in Etruria more or less during the last thousand years B.c.
                    until it succumbed to the Latin. It was the predominant language of Campania
                    also from 800 to 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> at which time it yielded to
                    the Oscan. Soon after this, owing to the incursions of the Gauls, it lost its
                    hold on what was apparently its oldest home in Italy, the valley of the Po, but
                    continued to exist in a debased form in the time of Livy (v. 33) among certain
                    peoples of the Alps, in particular among the Rhaeti. To the ancients Etruscan
                    sounded barbarous. Dionysius (i. 30) declared it to be related to no other
                    language. Still there was a time when among the better clas3 of Romans Etruscan
                    was taught, just as afterwards was Greek (Livy, ix. 36). Its remains as
                    preserved by writers are few and frequently misrepresented, including about 60
                    names of places, 28 rivers, several islands, hills, woods, and lakes. Of names
                    of persons there are 7 praenomina, and 50 gentile names and cognomina together,
                    a few names of deities, heroes, and mythical kings, 7 names of months, and about
                    30 glosses, mostly from Hesychius, Servius, and Festus, and in part very
                    doubtful. Altogether there are a little over 200 words, and of those many are
                    local names, and have obviously originated among peoples of the Ligurian,
                    Umbrian, and Latin races conquered by the Etruscans. The Etruscan inscriptions
                    discovered on antiquities up to the present time will be found in Fabretti’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum Italicarum,</hi> with

                    1874. The total number now reaches to about 50Ô0, and increases yearly at the
                    rate of 100 to 200. Unfortunately they include only 15 bi-linguals (Lat. and
                    Etr.), and these are very short, containing almost nothing but names. Except the
                    “Cippus of Perugia” found in 1822, which has 46 lines, Etruscan inscriptions are
                    all short, there being for instance only five which have more than 20 words.
                    Four-fifths of them are sepulchral, with the mere indication of names or
                    relationship. A few names of towns have been preserved on coins, as also the
                    numerals from 1 to 6, on a pair of ivory dice. Altogether there are about 200
                    words which appear not to be names.</p>

                    Leipsic, 1841) was the first to determine definitely the character of the
                    Etruscan alphabet. Its companion and northern variants were pointed out by
                    Mommsen <hi rend="italic">{Uηterdalische</hi><hi rend="italic">Dialekte,</hi>
                    Leipsic, 1840), and according to those authorities it was derived from a
                    Graeco-Chalcidian prototype current on the west coast of Italy. In its common
                    form it has the following 19 letters :—</p>
                <p>rt,D, 3, ⅜, H, Θ, I, q <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ni, n, <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">= k</hi> occurs as an archaic form of c; φ = φ = ph, mostly in
                    foreign words, and Λ <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> = <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    (Umbrian). The mediae o, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi><hi rend="italic">(I,</hi> and
                    the vowel o, though they often occur in words handed down by writers as
                    Etruscan, are never found in the inscriptions. (For other peculiarities see

                    language,—in fact, a dialect of the Latin. This opinion has maintained its
                    ground with many, and only quite recently we find the great work of Corssen <hi
                    rend="italic">{Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache der Etrusker,</hi> Leipsic,
                    1874—5) devoted to the elaboration of a strictly scientific basis for it. On the
                    other hand, Ottfried Müller <hi rend="italic">{Die Etruscer</hi>, Breslau, 1828)
                    had observed certain distinctly foreign elements in the language, and had
                    pointed them out clearly enough, without, however, venturing upon any conjecture
                    as to their source. His views, though adopted by Niebuhr, Mommsen, and Aufrecht,
                    have not satisfied others less skilled in these inquiries, who have endeavoured
                    to trace the Etruscan to a Celtic, Germanic, Slavic, Albanian, Basque, Semitic,
                    and lastly a Turanian origin (Isaac Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Etruscan
                    liesearches,</hi> London, 1874). These attempts have all failed, and Müller’s
                    attitude of reserve appears to be decidedly the best under the circumstances.

                    of O. Müller’s <hi rend="italic">Die Etruscer,</hi> Stuttgart, 1877.) As a
                    specimen of how the Etruscan language sounded may be given the inscription from
                    a tomb at Perugia known as the Torre di San Manno. It is the third longest of
                    existing inscriptions. The single words are separated from each other by two
                    dots and the lines by a vertical stroke. The last part, which is in brackets,
                    cannot be read with certainty:—cehen: su⅛i: hin&amp;iu: ⅛ues': sians': etve:
                    Siaure: lautnes'cle: caresri: aules': laràial: precuS·uras'i: ∣ lar⅛ialisvle:

                    heczri: tunur: clutiva: zelur [vs: cetiver: apas]. The simple vowels are <hi
                    rend="italic">a, e, i, u.</hi> Length is rarely indicated except in some
                    doubtful cases by means of repeating the vowel. Modification of the vowels, such
                    as occurs in various forms in the Indo-Germanic, Germanic, Semitic, and Turanian
                    languages, is foreign to the Etruscan. It has no prefixes, and the accent
                    appears to have been always on the first syllable, and in consequence of this
                    arose the habit of alliding vowels in the middle of words to such an extent as
                    to bring about frequently very disagreeable combinations of consonants. An
                    extreme case is that of Elχsntre = Αλ⅛αrδpos. Sometimes it may be due to a
                    method of writing, though there is no evidence whatever of vowels being inherent
                    in consonants. The diphthongs are <hi rend="italic">ai, au, ei, ia, ie, iu,

                    rend="italic">eia, eie, uia,</hi> and again <hi rend="italic">αe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ea, eu, ua, ue,</hi> which latter appear not to be original form3.
                    The consonants are <hi rend="italic">p, φ</hi> (almost only in foreign words);
                    <hi rend="italic">c, {k),</hi><hi rend="italic">χ;</hi><hi rend="italic">t, θ;
                    l, r; m,n∙,s {s'), z; v,f, h.</hi> The aspiration of the tenues is very
                    frequent, sometimes also of the mediae in foreign words, in which cases <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> take the place of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ, h</hi> of χ. It is doubtful whether <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> interchange with <hi rend="italic">θ; h</hi> is
                    sometimes allided. The hard <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is common to the Etruscan
                    and the Italian languages, as is also its interchange with <hi rend="italic"
                    >h.</hi> Assibilation <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> in the name <hi
                    rend="italic">pethnei,</hi> which also occurs as <hi rend="italic">petsnei,
                    pesnei,peznei)</hi> is common. Nasal letters often fall out before mutes, and
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> when preceding a labial becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> frequently, <hi rend="italic">e.g., lanφe, larnφe; s</hi> never changes
                    to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and the interchange of <hi rend="italic">I</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is doubtful. With regard to the suffixes indicating
                    masculine nouns, which have been wrongly used as an argument for the Italic
                    character of the Etruscan, the most numerous series ends in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>; the next is that in <hi rend="italic">e;</hi> endings in <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are comparatively rare, in ι⅛
                    and ⅛ less so, while <hi rend="italic">ia</hi> occurs only exceptionally.
                    Consonant endings are few. There is no suffix in <hi rend="italic">p, φ, z, v,f
                    h.</hi> The greater part of the feminine words, also chiefly names of peι∙sons,
                    are derived from the masculine by the suffix <hi rend="italic">ia;</hi> not
                    seldom <hi rend="italic">nia, ta,</hi><hi rend="italic">θa</hi> occur; also the
                    diminutives <hi rend="italic">za</hi> and <hi rend="italic">la.</hi> Besides
                    these, however, are a number of feminine <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n662/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0662-0639"/> words without corresponding masculines. As yet
                    there is no trace of a neuter. Positive traces of declension are few. In the
                    older inscriptions the nom. sin. in masculines ends in s <hi rend="italic"
                    >(s'),</hi> which afterwards is dropped. The gen. sing, in masculine words
                    ending in vowels, and in fem. words ending in consonants, is formed by <hi
                    rend="italic">sa,</hi> occasionally <hi rend="italic">ssa = s'a = za,</hi> and
                    shortened to s, <hi rend="italic">s', z.</hi> The connecting vowels <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are used after <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r, e.g., vele,</hi> gen. sing, <hi
                    rend="italic">velus(af</hi> But in masculines ending in consonants, and
                    feminines ending in vowels, the gen. sing, takes <hi rend="italic">l,</hi>
                    originally perhaps <hi rend="italic">la,</hi> or with connecting vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">al.</hi> But this system in the formation of the genitive seems to
                    have been interrupted at an early period by the more general use of the ending
                    <hi rend="italic">sa.</hi> A remarkable peculiarity of the Etruscan is the
                    apparently capricious doubling and trebling of the genitive suffix, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., sla (s'la),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">slisa (slis'a)</hi>
                    in masculines; <hi rend="italic">lisa</hi> [Z⅛z, <hi rend="italic">lisa, alisa
                    (alis'a), alls',</hi> contracted to <hi rend="italic">alsα, ls, ls',</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">als,</hi> αfe'] and <hi rend="italic">lisala (lisla, alιsala,
                    αlisla,</hi> perhaps <hi rend="italic">lis-v-le)'ιn</hi> masculine and feminine.
                    The dat. sing, is formed by the suffix <hi rend="italic">si (si)</hi> attached
                    to the nom., <hi rend="italic">9,g., clan</hi> (son), dat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >densi</hi> (with modification of the vowel). An accusative singular is probably
                    to be found in the phrase <hi rend="italic">arse</hi> verse = averte ignem, as
                    handed down by Festus, in which case it would be similar to the nominative as in
                    plural words. Few other cases in the singular have been traced. Possibly <hi
                    rend="italic">oesar</hi> is an instance of the nom. pl.; it would correspond to
                    the conjectural acc. pl. of <hi rend="italic">clenar</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >clan =</hi> son, from which the dat. pl. is <hi rend="italic"
                    >clenaras'i.</hi></p>
                <p>As to conjugation only one form is certain, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the
                    perf. 3 sing, in ce <hi rend="italic">(ke),</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">turce

                    =</hi> fuit; <hi rend="italic">arce</hi> = habuit; <hi rend="italic"
                    >zilaχnuce</hi> ≡≈ magistratum gessit (?). As to <hi rend="italic">lupuce,</hi>
                    however, and <hi rend="italic">zilaχnuce,</hi> there is some doubt. No augment
                    or reduplication is known. It is possible that the phrase <hi rend="italic">arse
                    verse</hi> contains an imperative; <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> appears positively
                    to mean “I am.” The numerals may be given as follows :— <hi rend="italic">θu
                    (θun)</hi> = 1 <hi rend="italic">; ci = 2; maχ</hi> = 3; <hi rend="italic">zal
                    (esal, esl)</hi> = 4; <hi rend="italic">s'a</hi> = 5; <hi rend="italic">hut
                    (huth) =</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">; semφ</hi> = 7; <hi rend="italic">cezp</hi> =
                    8 (10-2). The tens are formed by <hi rend="italic">alch(a)l,</hi> but
                    irregularly, <hi rend="italic">e.g., cealchl (celchl)</hi> — 20; <hi
                    rend="italic">muvalchl (mealchl) = 30.</hi> In mixed numbers the units preceded
                    the tens. Peculiar forms are <hi rend="italic">ciemzathrm,</hi> probably = 2 and
                    40, and <hi rend="italic">θuηesi muvalchl,</hi> probably 1 and 30; s added to
                    numerals may indicate the genitive. When <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is added it
                    seems to indicate repetition, <hi rend="italic">e.g., eslz=Λ</hi> times.
                    Pronouns and adverbs appear to be represented by the forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >eca, cehen,</hi><hi rend="italic">ta,</hi><hi rend="italic">eth,</hi> and a few
                    others. <hi rend="italic">An</hi> is perhaps a preposition. The present writer
                    believes he has discovered with certainty two enclitic conjunctions, c
                    (originally perhaps <hi rend="italic">ce)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    (with vowel) <hi rend="italic">urn, em,</hi> both equal to “and,” <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., puiac</hi> and <hi rend="italic">puiam</hi> = “and
                    wife.”</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> —It appears from a statement of Varro, quoted by
                    Censorinus <hi rend="italic">(DeDieNatali,xvii. 5fol.),</hi> that Etruscan
                    history was divided into ten periods or <hi rend="italic">soecιda,</hi> and it
                    is known otherwise that the tenth of these periods began in the year 44 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The first four saecula are given as lasting each 100
                    years, the fifth 123, the sixth 119, the seventh 119, and allowing for the
                    eighth and ninth each an average of 120 years, we obtain the year 1044 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> as the beginning of Etruscan chronology, a date which
                    curiously corresponds with that usually assigned to those great movements of
                    races in Greece with which the Etruscan traditions were associated. The really
                    important point, however, in these figures, as Helbig <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">dell</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Inst. Arch.</hi>
                    1876, p. 230) has lately shown, is the circumstance that the first four periods
                    are given iu round numbers, and thus justify the inference that the keeping of
                    regular records had not begun till the fifth period, commencing G44 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a date which at the most would not be more than a
                    century after the first introduction of the Greek alphabet into Italy by means
                    of the Greek colonists. Apparently the oldest alphabet as yet discovered on
                    Etruscan remains is that known as the Chalcidian-Greek. It occurs on a vase from
                    the Regulini-Galassi tomb at Caere, and in all probability it had not reached
                    the Etruscans before the end of the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    No doubt everything tends in this early period to connect the Etruscans, not
                    with the Greeks, but with the Carthaginians and the people of Italy and Sicily
                    opposing the then active Greek colonization, which must have seriously
                    threatened their trade. In 537 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> they united with
                    the Carthaginians, as has been mentioned, to drive out the Phocaeans from
                    Corsica. Such was the influence of Carthage in 509 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> that even the Romans accepted a commercial treaty with her; and among
                    the ascertained dates of objects from Etruria may be mentioned 673-527 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> as that to which certain porcelain vases with
                    hieroglyphics from Vulci and Caere are definitely assigned,—which vases again
                    point to commerce with a people who understood and could imitate hieroglyphics.
                    We have thus in the 7th and 6th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a
                    picture of activity and frequent contact among the trading and advanced peoples
                    of the Mediterranean which, though it implies a degree of national hostility on
                    the part of the Etruscans towards the Greeks, need not exclude the intercourse
                    of traders, nor a readiness to profit by the industrial and artistic skill of
                    the Greeks. Otherwise it would be impossible to account for the legend which
                    states that in the time of Cypselus, the tyrant of Corinth 660 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Pliny, xxxv., 12, 43), Demaratus, accompanied by
                    certain artists, Eucheir, Diopus, and Eugrammus, settled in Etruria, and gave
                    the first impulse to plastic art in Italy. These names sound legendary, but it
                    may be taken that they would not have been invented unless to account for a fact
                    which in this case is the very marked resemblance between the early art of
                    Etruria and of Greece, a resemblance which could not have been accidental, or at
                    any rate need not bo supposed to have been so when the means of communication
                    were so plentiful. We know, for instance, that the Etruscan silver coinage was
                    struck on the Attic system as arranged by Solon about 590 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> having similar designs <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the face of the
                    Gorgon), the same weight, the same nominal, <pb break="no"

                    its half, and with apparently the same sign of the half as that used at Athens
                    for the hemiobol (Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Römisches Münzwesen,</hi> p. 218).
                    Tuscan architecture, essentially Greek, approaches most closely to the early
                    Ionic-Attic style. The general impression, however, has been that it was through
                    Corinth rather than through Athens that Etruria came into contact with Greek
                    art, and this not so much because of the legend just quoted as because both
                    Corinth and Etruria enjoyed the same high reputation in antiquity for unrivalled
                    skill of working in terra-cotta and in bronze. But doubtless there were many
                    different sources of contact.</p>
                <p>As regards skill in the execution of artistic designs, it would seem as if all
                    that the Etruscans ever attained in this direction had been learnt from the
                    Greeks, and, it will be fair to suppose, from Greeks resident among them. But
                    when we come to the subjects of these designs, it is clear that there is a
                    difference between the early and late works in this respect, that, while in the
                    latter the subjects as well as the style are almost always Greek, in the former
                    there are certain obviously Oriental features. Under the circumstances it could
                    scarcely have been otherwise, since at least from the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> onwards the Greeks ruled supreme in matters of art,
                    whereas in the early period of the 7th and 6th centuries, their artistic
                    productions, though then also doubtless by far the best attainable, had yet to
                    compete against those of the Phoenicians or their kin⅛jnen the Carthaginians,
                    who in fact had been longer in the market. The characteristic of Phoenician art
                    was its mixture and blending of the two elements of design, originally peculiar
                    to Assyria and Egypt, upon which was afterwards engrafted, when the Greek style
                    had developed itself, a distinctly Greek element. That Phoenician productions of
                    the earlier class were imported into Etruria is seen for example in the silver
                    vases from the Regulini-Galassi tomb at Caere (AΓws. <hi rend="italic">Etrusco
                    Vaticano,</hi> i., pl. 63-66), which, always suspected to have been Phoenician,
                    were proved to be such from their identity of style with another silver vase
                    found at Praeneste in 1875, and bearing a Phoenician inscription <hi
                    rend="italic">(Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic">dell</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Inst. Arch. Rom.,</hi> x., pl. 32, fig.
                    1). This again is artistically identical with the silver paterae from Cyprus,
                    descriptions of which are collected by Helbig in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">dell’ Inst. Arch.,</hi> 1876, p. 199-204. Further
                    evidence of Phoenician importations is to be found in the porcelain vases with
                    hieroglyphics already mentioned, in the ostrich eggs ornamented with designs
                    from a tomb at Vulci, and now in the British Museum, and in the richly engraved
                    shell of the species <hi rend="italic">Tridacηa squamosa</hi> peculiar to the
                    Red Sea and Indian Ocean, also now in the British Museum. At the same time, even
                    if this importation of w orks of art had been on a much greater scale than there
                    is as yet reason to suppose it to have been, it is clear that all the artistic
                    influence derivable in this way must have been small compared with that which
                    would naturally have been exercised on the Etruscans by the Greek colonists of
                    Italy, and still more by the Greek artists who had made Etruria their home, as
                    may be inferred from the legend already quoted. (See Mommsen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Rome, Eng. Transl.,</hi> i., p. 248, who says, “The Italians may
                    have bought from the Phoenicians; they learned only from the Greeks;” and again,
                    p. 247, “Italian art developed itself not under Phoenician but exclusively under
                    Hellenic influence.”) Besides, the Oriental features of which mention has been
                    made in early Etruscan art were in point of fact common in a high degree to
                    early Greek art also, and it may have been through this channel that they found
                    their way, rather than by direct contact with the Phoenicians or Carthaginians.
                    In dealing with the artistic remains of the Etruscans, it will be more
                    convenient to take them in classes, according to their material or the purpose
                    they served, than in groups of a historical sequence. Strictly speaking there
                    appears to be no historical development in them. There are archaic works, there
                    are very late works, and there are works of a middle stage, but there is no
                    growth from one to the other. The process of change consists of a leap to the
                    next new phase of art developed by the Greeks, who, so to speak, set the
                    fashion. It happens also that certain classes of objects went out of use or came
                    into use with particular periods of art, and with the aid of this circumstance
                    it will be possible to observe something approaching a historical order. We
                    begin with the scarabs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scarabs.—</hi> These are gems consisting usually of carnelian
                    or banded agate, cut in the form of beetles (scarabaei), and having a flat face
                    on wdιieh a design is engraved in intaglio. They are pierced transversely, and
                    were attached by swivels to rings either to be worn on the finger or to be hung
                    on a chain round the neck. The form of the scarab suggests an origin in Egypt,
                    where, in fact, they have been found in great numbers. But excepting the form
                    there is singularly little in common between the scarabs of Etruria and of
                    Egypt. This is the more remarkable since the Carthaginians, from whom—or from
                    the Phoenicians—it is naturally supposed the Etruscans had obtained the notion
                    of this form of ornament, have left in Sardinia (at Tharros, Sulcis, and
                    Cagliari) considerable numbers of scarabs, the designs of which are for the most
                    part, though not purely Egyptian, yet obviously derived from that source. These
                    Sardinian scarabs are cut in green jasper, the favourite material in Egypt, or
                    occasionally in porcelain or glass, materials equally utilized in that country.
                    Then also there is the fact that as yet only one or two scarabs have been found
                    in Greece, and indeed very few engraved gems of any shape showing a fairly
                    developed art comparable with that of the Etruscan scarabs, so that from both
                    sidee it would seem as if the Etruscans must have been dependent for models in
                    this branch of their art on the Phoenicians or Carthaginians. On the other hand,
                    there was a law of Solon’s (Diog. Laert., i. 57) forbidding gem-engravers to
                    keep casts or seals of rings engraved by them, and from this it is to be
                    inferred that in bis time the art was practised with the success then attending
                    the other arts. This being admitted, the result obtained from an examination of
                    the scarabs becomes clear. The designs, with few exceptions, are purely Greek,
                    and as a rule they indicate the 7th and 6th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> as the period of their origin; that is to say, the workmanship on
                    them corresponds to the Greek workmanship of that period. So also the subjects
                    represented. If, for instance, w e take either the remains of Greek art or the
                    existing descriptions of works executed at this time but now loβt, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the chest of Cypselus (Pausanias, v. 17), the throne of
                    Apollo at Amyclae (Pausanias, iii. 18), and the paintings of Polygnotus at
                    Delphi (Pausanias, x. 25-31), it will be seen that the chief delight of artists
                    was then in rendering the exploits of heroes, and that figures of deities occur
                    in comparison very rarely. Nor is this remarkable, since it was in this period
                    that the Greeks carried the worship of their heroic but legendary ancestors to
                    its highest point. The same result will be found Jin the Etruscan scarabs, if we
                    take as fairly representative the collection in the British Museum. Out of 197
                    specimens, excluding those which are of too rude workmanship to be of interest
                    in the question, 167 have subjects drawn entirely from Greek legends of heroes;
                    of the remainder 10 represent Greek divinities, 18 such fabulous beings as
                    centaurs, gorgons, satyrs, sirens, and harpies, all more or less connected with
                    the heroic legends of Greece. Only two give native Etruscan deities or
                    personifications. (See <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review,</hi> 1875, p.
                    729.) An entirely similar state of things will be found by reference to the
                    lists of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n664/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0664-0641"/> scarabs published in the “Impronte Gemmarie” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bullet d. Inst. Arch. Bom.,</hi> 1831, p. 105; 1834, p. 116;
                    1839, p. 99). Of the Greek divinities in the Museum collection, two are
                    represented by heads of Athene obviously copied from an early coin of Corinth,
                    while the two heads of the gorgon in the list stand in the same relation to a
                    series of silver coins till recently ascribed to Athens, but now by some high
                    authorities ascribed to Attica. Nor are these the only instances in which Greek
                    coins have been used as models to imitate. Still, notwithstanding this, coupled
                    also with the fact that the processes of diesinking aud gem-engraving were
                    almost identical, it is clear in many cases that the Etruscans had not confined
                    themselves to models from this class of objects, but had skill enough to adapt
                    designs from other sources, and especially from statues or figures sculptured in
                    the round as more suitable than reliefs, at least where the gem was translucent,
                    and could be held up to the light to be looked at as was frequently the case. A
                    certain number of the designs are clearly treated as reliefs, but the majority
                    exhibit a minuteness of anatomical detail and attitudes more appropriate to
                    sculpture in the round, not necessarily, however, always to statues strictly
                    so-called, since in many cases the attitude is such that the figure could not
                    have stood unless in one or other of the various positions assigned to figures
                    in the pediments of temples, as for instance among the sculptures from Aegina in
                    Munich, where the same minuteness and exactness of anatomy will be seen in the
                    perfection to which it had attained in Greece at the close of the 6th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> That the Tuscan temples were also decorated with
                    sculptures in the pediments is known, not, however, the extent to which the
                    designs may have been derived from the Greeks, though from the analogy of the
                    rest of Etruscan art the probability is that they were pretty closely copied;
                    and when Pliny (xxxv. 154), on the authority of Varro, speaks of the sculptures
                    in all the temples of Rome previous to 493 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> being
                    “Tuscan,” it is fair to suppose that his <hi rend="italic">Tuscanica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">signa</hi> would correspond both in style and in subject to early
                    Greek art of the period previous to this date. That view of the case would
                    explain why so many of the scarabs come to have subjects best suited to the
                    decoration of temple pediments, and to indicate further at what period this
                    particular process of studying from Greek models took place; it may be added
                    that the oldest statue of a deity in Rome,—that of Diana in the temple on the
                    Aventine, dedicated, according to tradition, between 577 and 534
                    B.c.—represented the type of the Ephesian Artemis familiar in early Greek and
                    Etruscan art. On the scarabs, draped figures are in a great minority, the
                    preference being, as in early Greek sculpture, for the nude, with a great
                    display of physical structure. In a considerable number of cases the names of
                    the personagee represented are inscribed on the gems in Etruscan characters, a
                    habit which prevailed also in early Greek art. Some few scarabs have a figure
                    engraved in relief on the back. With comparatively rare exceptions, the intaglio
                    is surrounded with a cable border, and when geme are found with this border but
                    without being scarabs, it is usual to describe them as scarabs which have been
                    cut down in more recent times for the sake of the stone, not always correctly
                    so, since this border appears to have been occasionally adopted by Roman
                    gem-engravers of later times. It is not impossible also that a number of the
                    scarabs now existing, as to which generally there is little or no information
                    concerning their <hi rend="italic">provenance,</hi> may have been made in Rome
                    about the time of Augustus, when a taste prevailed for the revival of archaic
                    art. Otherwise the production of scarabs, to judge from their style, must have
                    ceased before the beginning of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    When it began is a question which depends on when Greek sculpture attained
                    mastery in rendering the human form (probably from the 8th to the 6th centuries
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> since it is at this stage of the art that the
                    scarabs, so to speak, strike into it. They have none of those grotesquely
                    conceived animals executed on steatite or other soft stones which abound on the
                    earliest Greek gems. From the general considerations already stated, and from
                    the likelihood that the Etruscan period of imitation would not be before the
                    last stage of archaic art in Greece, the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> will be a reasonable <hi rend="italic">terminus a quo</hi> for its
                    start.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coins.—</hi> Considered as works of art, the coins may be
                    classed next to the scarabs, from the similarity of the processes by which they
                    are made, and the limited field which they present for design. It has been
                    already said that the silver coinage of Etruria was struck on the Attic standard
                    as introduced by Solon in the beginning of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The gold coinage is according to the Miletus standard, which appears
                    to have been the oldest gold standard in European Greece, including Athens,
                    whence doubtless it was obtained by Etruria along with the silver standard

                    The majority of the silver and gold, as well as the light copper coins belonging
                    to the same system, are stamped only on one side, in accordance with the early
                    custom, the types being essentially Greek, among them the head of the gorgon
                    (fig. 2) similar to that referred to on the scarabs, and the cuttle-fish such as
                    appears on Greek coins, and very frequently on the early pottery from Ialysus in
                    Rhodes, and the ornaments from Mycenae and Spata in Attica. Whatever may be the
                    date ultimately assigned to the antiquities just mentioned, it may be taken as
                    certain that the Etruscan coins in question do not go back to an earlier time
                    than that of Solon (about 590 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and may be half a
                    century later, or even much more in some instances. Others with different types
                    are distinctly late.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Ware.—</hi> Connected in a measure with tho engraved gems
                    is a series of black terra-cotta vases, many of which are ornamented with bands
                    of figures in low relief pressed out in the clay when it is soft by means of an
                    engraved cylinder rolled round the vase in such a way that the same design is
                    constantly being repeated each time the cylinder completes a revolution.
                    Frequently the designs are purely Oriental, either Egyptian or Assyrian, as if
                    made directly from imported cylinders. In other cases they consist of rows of
                    animals, the lion, deer, sphinx, and panther, followed by a winged human figure
                    moving at speed, and perhaps representing such a being as the gorgon, altogether
                    presenting precisely the same appearance as those early painted vases found in
                    Greek localities, and attributed to a period of prevailing Oriental influence
                    very justly supposed to have been communicated to the Greeks by the Phoenicians,
                    since on Phoenician silver vases, as that of Curium (Cesnola, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyprus,</hi> p. 329), very similar bands of animals occur. The nearer we
                    approach to the main centres of Phoenician industry, as for instance at Camirus
                    in Rhodes, the more frequent are these designs of animals. Among the cases where
                    the design is essentially of Hellenic origin may be mentioned a large circular
                    dish in the British Museum, having the representation of a banquet scene with
                    two couches, and attendants dancing and playing on the flute, constantly
                    repeated in two rows <pb break="no"

                    VIII. ) abound in early Etruscan art, and, so that there may be no doubt as to
                    whence they were derived, on the early Greek vases found in Etruria. The date of
                    this Greek pottery would then determine that of the Etruscan, and by means of
                    the inscriptions not seldom occurring on the former, we arrive at a period not
                    much if at all before 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a result which again
                    brings us to what has already appeared to have been the first great period of
                    contact between the Etruscans and Greeks. It is to be observed also that the
                    earlier system of vase decoration in Greece, by means of geometric patterns, is
                    not found in Etruscan ware. Further, on the black vases in question are to be
                    seen often figures modelled in the round which could not have been derived from
                    Greece before 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> since it was not till then
                    that sculpture in the round was fairly introduced there, and could not well have
                    been derived from Assyria, since that country appears to have never developed
                    this branch of art, while as regards Egypt it may be answered that the figures
                    are in no way of an Egyptian type. This black ware seems to have been chiefly a
                    local fabric of Clusium. Still at one time it may have been general in Etruria
                    and also in Latium, which as at Albano has yielded from under the lava a series
                    of very ancient vases of this same texture, but without the characteristic
                    ornamentation, which, as has been said, limits the Etruscan pottery to a period
                    not earlier than <hi rend="smallcaps">600b.c.,</hi> and possibly in. some cases
                    to at least a century later than this.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jewellery.—</hi> Their tombs have preserved ample evidence of
                    the passion of the Etruscans for rich dresses and personal ornaments, the former
                    surviving in the wall-paintings, the latter in actual specimens of goldsmith’s
                    work, consisting of necklaces, ear-rings, wreaths, bracelets, finger-rings, and
                    fibulae for fastening the dress. From a comparison of any large collection of
                    these ornaments, such as that of the British Museum or of the Vatican Museum,
                    with the same class of objects from Greece, it will be observed as a rule that
                    where a pattern of any kind has to be produced, the Greek accomplished it
                    skilfully and rapidly by means of fine gold wire soldered down into the required
                    design,—that is, by filigree, as it is called; while the Etruscan preferred to
                    give it by sometimes innumerable and almost imperceptibly minute globules of
                    gold, each separately made, and all soldered down in the necessary order—that is
                    to say, by granulated work. But these characteristics, essentially correct as
                    they are, do not hold in all cases, since, on the one hand, there are numbers of
                    Etruscan specimens where the granulated work is not employed, though it would be
                    difficult to point to any one where the true filigree system takes its place,
                    and since, on the other hand, granulated work is found on the early Greek
                    ornaments from Camirus in Rhodes, now in the British Museum (for a specimen of
                    these ornaments, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Archaeology,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 350). The latter circumstance, exceptional though it is at present, may still
                    serve to show how it may have been through the Greeks that this process of
                    working in gold reached Etruria, in which case it must have happened at a period
                    scarcely later than 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the Camirus figures
                    corresponding very markedly with the descriptions of certain figures on the
                    chest of Cypselus. No doubt this process of working may equally well have been
                    obtained through the Phoenicians,, if we may judge by the specimens from their
                    settlements in Sardinia, and to some degree in Cyprus, and on the whole it is
                    likely that in this matter of personal ornament the Etruscans were more in
                    sympathy with the Phoenicians and orientals than with the Greeks. The bracelets,
                    armlets, necklaces, and finger-rings worn by men on the Assyrian sculptures were
                    precisely such as appealed to Etruscan tastes, and were not well to be had
                    through the medium of the Greeks, unless perhaps the Greeks of Cyprus, who
                    worked side by side with the Phoenicians. The three gold necklaces engraved by
                    Cesnola <hi rend="italic">{Cyprus,</hi> pl. 22-24) might have been obtained from
                    Etruscan tombs, instead of from a treasure chamber in Cyprus, so far as the
                    workmanship is concerned. In any case the original invention of so toilsome a
                    process as that of the granulated work, while it cannot fairly be ascribed to
                    the Greeks, may well have been due to the Phoenicians, whose greatest fame in
                    very early times was for their skill in metal work, and whose products of this
                    na ture —for example, the silver paterae of the Regulini-Galassi tomb at
                    Caere—have been traced to Etruria as well as to Latium (Praeneste) and the coast
                    of Italy (Salerno). From the fact that with the loss of their national
                    independence there came rather an increase than otherwise of private wealth
                    among the Etruscans, and a consequent continuation of the demand for jewellery,
                    it happens that there is among their remains material for the study of this
                    branch of their art or industry in its latest as well as its earliest stages. In
                    the earliest specimens there is a preference for figures of animals in rows, as
                    on the early vases, followed by winged figures of deities, the artistic element
                    of form being always very rude and mechanical. In later times the human form is
                    introduced faithfully, true to the Greek type, and representing personages from
                    Greek legend or mythology. Gold was the favourite material, and with it were
                    employed amber, glass, precious stones, occasionally enamel, and seldom silver.
                    The precious stones most in use, either for finger-rings or for necklaces, were
                    the carnelian and agate, cut either as scarabs or as beads. Glass was made into
                    beads. Amber served a variety of purposes, as beads, ornaments of fibulae, where
                    it is employed with gold, and amulets, of which one specimen in the British
                    Museum is in the form of an ape of a species peculiar to India <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Macacus rhesus),</hi> whence the knowledge of it has been supposed to have
                    been conveyed by the ships of Tarshish which brought apes and peacocks from that
                    quarter. The amber itself was obtained first of all from about the mouth of the
                    Po, and afterwards from the Baltic as now; but whether, as has been lately
                    maintained (Helbig, <hi rend="italic">Peal Accademia dei Lincei,</hi> Rome,
                    1876-7), the artistic remains in this material can be all grouped into one of
                    two classes, representing a very early and a very late period with no
                    intermediary stage, is a question on which perhaps more remains to be said
                    before it is finally settled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bronzes.—</hi> Among the articles still pertaining to personal
                    use is the series of bronze mirrors the extent of which may be conceived from
                    the fact that a considerable number have been found since the publication of
                    Gerhard’s work <hi rend="italic">{Etruskische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Spiegel,</hi> 1843-1867), with 430 plates, many of which give from four to six
                    examples. These mirrors are polished on one side, and on the other have a design
                    engraved on the bronze, taken in the majority of cases from Greek legend or
                    mythology, and no less from an artistic point of view founded on Greek models
                    (see fig. 3). But while· this is obvious enough, it is remarkable that as yet
                    probably not more than six engraved mirrors have been discovered in Greece
                    itself, and except in one case even these cannot be said to bear any analogy of
                    design to the Etruscan mirrors. Perhaps it deserves to be considered that these
                    few specimens come from Corinth, whence, as tradition said, Greek art was
                    introduced into Etruria. But it is not enough to suppose the first impulse
                    towards work of this kind to have come from Greece. It is necessary to find, if
                    not mirrors, some other classes of objects which could have supplied the
                    Etruscans with the multitude of entirely Greek designs which they have
                    reproduced. No doubt the painted vases were largely drawn up, especially the
                    shallow paterae, with designs on a circular space in the centre, as may be seen,
                    for example, in the three mirrors in Gerhard (pl. 159, 160), where the group of
                    Peleus carrying off Thetis, familiar on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0668-0643"/> vases, is reproduced with the difference that the
                    attributes of Heracles (bow and club) are given to Peleus. Iu the mirrors just
                    mentioned the figures are rendered in low, flat relief, but this is very
                    exceptional. In other cases also the groups appear to be taken from the centres
                    of pediment sculptures on temples, the figures, diminishing in scale towards
                    each side, being made to fit into the narrowing circle of the mirror.
                    Artistically they may be arranged in three classes. The first is an archaic
                    style, in which the subjects, drapery, and general treatment of the figures have
                    much of a local Etruscan character, though still on the model of early Greek
                    work; the second a free style, where everything seems Greek of about the 4th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> except the names of the persons
                    inscribed in Etruscan. Mirrors of this style have been found in Latium at
                    Praeneste, along with bronze cistae similarly decorated with engraved designs;
                    occasionally both on the cistae and the mirrors are inscriptions in early Latin.
                    The finest example of theso utensils is that known as the Ficoroni cista, which,
                    but for its bearing the name of a Latin artist, might be regarded as an
                    excellent example of Greek art in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> at which period it appears to have been largely spread in Latium as
                    well as Etruria (Müller, <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler,</hi> No. 309, and
                    Bronsted, <hi rend="italic">Den</hi> A7coronιs∕ce Cfsto, Copenhagen, 1847).
                    Thethird isalateand barbarous native style. The range of subjects is wide. Still
                    it will be noticed that the almost exclusive use of mirrors by women has
                    rendered subjects otherwise familiar, such as scenes of war, inappropriate. The
                    labours of Heracles were much admired, as were incidents in the story of Helen,
                    yet neither of them occur so frequently as scenes between satyrs and maenads, or
                    the common representation of ladies at their toilet. In great numbers, but
                    always on small or poor examples, appear certain figures which have been
                    identified as the Cabiri, and in any case seem to have been household genii. A
                    small number of circular mirror-cases have been found, ornamented with reliefs,
                    of which both the subjects and the execution are in the majority of instances
                    purely Greek, of a comparatively late period.</p>
                <p>Of skill in bronze casting there is little evidence among the Etruscan remains.
                    In one specimen in the British Museum from Sessa on the Volturno (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Costume,</hi> vol. vi. p. 455, fig. 6), a core of iron has been
                    employed, which by expanding has burst the figure down the side; and again in
                    another specimen in the national collection a female bust from the Polledrara
                    tomb (Grotta of Isis) at Vulci, it will be seen that the art of casting was
                    unknown when it was executed. It is made of a number of thin pieces of bronze
                    plate beaten out into the form of parts of the bust, and all fastened together,
                    sometimes with fine nails, but apparently also in places with some sort of
                    solder. On the other-hand, to judge from the vases found in this tomb, which are
                    made of pieces rivetted together with nails, it would seem as if solder could
                    hardly have been known. The same process of uniting parts together occurs in the
                    very ancient silver relief from Perugia (Millingen, <hi rend="italic">Cned.
                    Mon.,</hi> pt. ii, pl. 14). The bust from Vulci, and the vases and other
                    antiquities discovered with it, are engraved in Micali <hi rend="italic">(Mon.
                    Ined.,</hi> pl. vi.-vιii.) It will be seen from the porcelain vases and scarabs
                    among them bearing hieroglyphics, and from the ostrich eggs with designs
                    resembling those of the early Corinthian vases, that the origin of the contents
                    of this tomb properly belongs, not only to a period of intercourse with Egypt,
                    but to a period when that intercourse was conducted by the Phoenicians, who
                    alone knew how to adapt designs from the Greeks on the one hand, as well as from
                    the Egyptians on the other. Indeed, one of the scarabs bears the cartouche of
                    Psammetichus, whose date is 666 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and ] though it
                    might have been made considerably after this time, it obviously could not have
                    come into existence before. On the whole, 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> may
                    be set down as probably the date of these antiquities. As regards the mass of
                    existing statuettes cast in the round, they bear generally, except in the matter
                    of dress, distinct evidence of Greek origin, not only in the style and
                    execution, but also in the subjects (see fig. 4). Still it is noticeable,
                    especially among the later specimens, that a very marked spirit of realism is
                    blended with the original idealism of the Greek prototypes. This realism of the
                    Etruscans comes out very strikingly iu the portrait sculpture of their
                    sarcophagi, and probably was a phase of artistic capacity which they shared with
                    the Romans. The purpose of these bronze statuettes was to surmount vases and
                    candelabra, or to serve as handles of mirrors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Terra-cottas.—</hi> The skilful modelling of terra-cotta, for
                    which the Etruscans were celebrated, was, it appears, chiefly directed to the
                    production of ornamental tiles, sarcophagi, and statues, rather than thoso small
                    and mostly graceful statuettes which are found in large numbers iu Greek
                    localities. The statues which were placed on the pediments of temples have
                    naturally perished. Specimens of the tiles and a large number of sarcophagi,
                    however, remain, the latter being for the most part of a late period, and
                    executed under the influence of a completely developed Greek ait. Fortunately
                    two sarcophagi of the greatest interest for the study of the early art of
                    Etruria have been found at Caerc. The one, now in the Louvre (engraved, <hi

                    lid. The other (for engraving of which see Plate VIII.) is now in the British
                    Museum, and while having a similar group of figures of about life size on the
                    lid, is besides richly decorated with bas-reliefs round the four sides. In both
                    sarcophagi colours are freely employed, which originally must have been slightly
                    staring, and increase the effect of realism, which in the figures on the lids is
                    all the more conspicuous by comparison with the reliefs, where the true early
                    Greek spirit, as seen on the vases, is strictly maintained. The reason of this
                    difference may partly lie in the fact that Greek models for the reliefs were
                    easily enough obtained, while on the other hand Greek figures approaching in
                    resemblance those on the lid here must at least have been very scarce. At the
                    same time it is also to be remembered that owing to the impossibility of
                    counting on the places where the terra-cotta might shrink, or to what extent
                    this might go, no other treatment would be suitable except that of a bold, rough
                    realism, the effect of which could not easily be destroyed. With the reliefs
                    there was no such danger.. The type of face shown in these figures is not to be
                    taken as that of the early Etruscans, for this reason that their essential
                    peculiarities, the sloping forehead, and eyes and the corners of the mouth
                    turned upwards, are obviously mannered exaggerations of the early Greek style of
                    rendering these features, for which undoubtedly there may have been some small
                    grounds in the actual features of the people. Besides on the reliefs there is
                    very little of this exaggeration. The attitude of the figures on the lid is that
                    of a man and wife at a banquet scene, probably here intended to indicate the
                    eternal banquet which appears to have been considered the lot of the happy in
                    the next world. The sarcophagus, to judge from the inscription painted on it,
                    was that of a lady named Thania Velai Matinai Unata. Another inscription painted
                    along the lid reads <hi rend="italic">Mi vela vesnas me vepe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tursi</hi><hi rend="italic">kipa,</hi> which, according to the
                    interpretation of Corssen (i. p. 784), is the dedication of the monument. From
                    the character of the letters it has been thought that this sarcophagus need not
                    be earlier than the end of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a
                    period which would not be unsuitable to the workmanship, if we allow that it may
                    have retained many traditions from an earlier time, which in Greece generally
                    had by then been abandoned. The relief on the front represents a combat of two
                    armed men, of whom the one has received a mortal blow and is falling. From the
                    wound his soul has escaped, and is seen in the shape of a winged figure bounding
                    away on the extreme right. The soul of the victorious warrior comes tripping in
                    on the extreme left. This manner of representing the soul recalls in some degree
                    the sepulchral vases of the Athenians, where it appears as a small winged
                    figure, and recalls also the <hi rend="italic">psychostasia</hi> of very early
                    times, in which the souls of two combatants were supposed to be placed in a
                    balance and weighed against each other while the fight was proceeding. It will
                    be seen also that the wounded warrior is already being devoured by the dog of
                    the battle field, thus giving an instance of what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >prolepsis,</hi> and is not unfamiliar in early art. That is to say, the artist
                    has attempted to realize two separate moments of the action,— first the actual
                    wounding, and secondly the consequence of it, viz.,—that the body of the
                    vanquished is left to be devoured by dogs and kites, a fate which the heroes of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> of ten promise their opponents in battle.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A similar instance of <hi
                    rend="italic">prolepsis</hi> is when Perseus is figured, cutting off the head of
                    Medusa, and already holds at his side Pegasus, the winged horse, which did not
                    spring from her until her head was entirely off.</p></note> That the combatants
                    here are Achilles and Memnon is not improbable, and in this case the principal
                    female figures will be respectively their mothers Thetis and Eos, each with an
                    attendant; the male attendant on each side perhaps was attached to the warriors
                    themselves. The stoιy begins on one of the ends of the sarcophagus with the two
                    warriors parting for battle; in the front is the combat; on the other end the
                    mourning, and on the back the eternal banquet. The feet are formed by four
                    sirens in their capacity as daughters of the earth sent by Persephone to assist
                    mourners to wail for the dead (Euripides, <hi rend="italic">Helena,</hi> 167).
                    In other cases the sirens were thought of as carrying away the souls of the
                    dead, as on the Harpy monument from Xanthus in Lycia. The later urns and
                    sarcophagi will be found collected in Brunn’s <hi rend="italic">Rilievi</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Vase Painting.—</hi> It has been proved that the great mass of
                    painted vases found in Etruria, and familiarly called Etruscan, are productions
                    of Greek workmen. The subjects, the style, and the inscriptions are all Greek.
                    But side by side with them are certain undoubtedly Etruscan vases, the very
                    small number of which would suggest that in this direction at least the Greek
                    models defied imitation if indeed the attempts in question did not clearly show
                    this. At the same time it must be admitted that between the early Corinthian
                    vases of about the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> discovered in
                    Etruria, and the probably contemporary specimens of native work there is no very
                    great difference. It was the later development which the Etruscans could not
                    follow. Specimens of early imitation found at Caere will be seen engraved in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Inst. Arch. Rom.,</hi> vi.
                    pls. 14, 15, 33, 36; vi.-vii., pl. 73, the peculiarities of which, such as in
                    costume, type of face, disproportion between figures of men and of animals, are
                    pointed out in detail by Helbig, <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d. Inst. Arch. Rom.,</hi> χxxv., p. 210, fol. The style of the originals,
                    including the correct degree of subordination in the design to the vase which it
                    adorns, is lost, and in its place stands out a certain gross reality in conflict
                    with the form of the vase. It does not follow that these imitations were made
                    contemporary with the originals (about the end of the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> but a strong argument in favour of such a view
                    might be found in a vase from the Polledrara tomb at Vulci, the antiquities of
                    which have been shown to belong to this period. The vase in question like the
                    others has a design purely Greek in its subject and general treatment—Theseus
                    struggling with the Minotaur, while Ariadne holds the clue, a chorus, chariots,
                    and centaurs with human forelegs. But it differs in this respect, that the
                    outlines of the figures are drawn with a crude red colour upon the varnished
                    surface of the vase, not as in other cases on spaces left unvarnished. From that
                    circumstance, and from the general effect of these Caeretan vases as compared
                    with the reliefs on the large sarcophagus, just described, from the same
                    locality, it will be seen that the skilled workman of Etruria turned more
                    readily to modelling in terra-cotta than to the complicated and difficult
                    process of vase-painting. As regards the few attempts made in late times it may
                    be said that they also fail in the direction of grossness. See, for example, the
                    vase in the British Museum with Ajax falling on his sword and Actaeon defending
                    himself from his hounds. Mention, however, should be made of one specimen in the
                    Museum collection where all the technical skill of a Greek <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> potter is displayed, and its Etruscan origin revealed only by the subject
                    and by certain details familiar in the mirrors. The composition of the scenes is
                    in some respects like that of a picture with perspective, which, while it is not
                    a feature of Greek vases, can neither be called Etruscan on the ground of any
                    known analogy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mural painting.—</hi> The mural paintings of the Etruscans are
                    known only from their tombs, the inner walls of which it was not unusual to

                    armour, and other adjuncts. The principal localities in which these paintings
                    have been discovered are Veii, Chiusi, Vulci, Caere, and Tarquinii. The most
                    important of them will be found engraved in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Inst. Arch. Pom.,</hi> those of Tarquinii in

                    the state of opinion concerning the antiquity of this art in Etruria, see Helbig
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Inst. Arch. Pom.,</hi>
                    1863, p. 336, and again <hi rend="italic">Annali,</hi> 1870, p. 5-74, in reply
                    to Brunn who had criticised his theory in the meantime in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali,</hi> 1866, p. 442. Both wrote from personal inspection, and from an
                    acquaintance with Etruscan remains such as no other writers possess. If they
                    differ as to whether this or that painting is older than another, they yet
                    appear to be agreed on the main points that, taken altogether, these paintings
                    represent three successive stages of the art, the oldest stage being
                    characterized as Tuscan and as exhibiting little of Greek influence, the second
                    as strongly marked by the features of Greek painting in the phase in w hich it
                    was left by Polygnotus, and the third as completely under the domination of
                    Greek art as it existed in the Hellenistic age. It is not meant that this oldest
                    or Tuscan school was an original creation, but only that with perhaps no better
                    models than Greek vases, the Etruscans then developed a system of mural painting
                    which may be called their own, the more so since its spirit of localizing its
                    subjects by giving the figures native dress and types of face is seen at times
                    surviving in the later stage. The tomb at Veii is assigned by Helbig to the
                    first period, and in any case it must be ranked as early, since that town was
                    destroyed in 396 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Obviously very early are also
                    the pictures from Caere <hi rend="italic">{Monumenti,</hi> vi., pl. 30), where a
                    female is being brought to an altar to be sacrificed. In the scene is an ancient
                    statue (xoanon), a curious figure of a soul in the air, two warriors and two
                    figures sitting face to face. It is, however,inthepaintingsof thesecond period,
                    especially those of Tarquinii (see fig. 5), that the Etruscan show to the best
                    advantage, as having the delicacy and refinement of drawing combined with
                    nobility of figure ascribed by tradition to Polygnotus, and still traceable on
                    the earlier examples of the Greek vases with red figures, wearing thin
                    transparent draperies which do not conceal the forms and movements of the limbs.
                    Here the Etruscan artist has a complete command of skill, and is obviously
                    conscious of it from the precision with which he carries out his finest lines.
                    The types of his figures are of pure Greek beauty, and their movement such as
                    that on the best vases. No doubt these particular paintings are exceptional
                    among those that remain now, but in what relation they had stood to the general
                    run at the time when they were executed is another question. The others sin more
                    or less in the direction already pointed out as characteristic of the Etruscans,
                    a certain gross realism under which there probably lay artistic strength of some
                    kind. As regards the latest stage it has little to distinguish it from Greek
                    work except the occasional presence of peculiarly Etruscan daemons, Etruscan
                    inscriptions explaining the subjects, and again frequently the native realism
                    carried sometimes to the extent of being nearly grotesque. In the early
                    specimens the subjects consist mostly of banquet scenes attended by dances to
                    music apparently in groves, perhaps those of Elysium and games such as
                    accompanied funeral obsequies in Greece and probably also in Etruria. Doubtless
                    these representations in the interiors of tombs were intended to realize the
                    future life of the deceased. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.</hi> g. <hi
