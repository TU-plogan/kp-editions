                <p><label type="entry">ESCORIAL</label>, or, as the name is not unfrequently given,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Escurial,</hi> one of the most remarkable buildings in
                    Europe, comprising at once a convent, a church, a palace, and a mausoleum. It is
                    situated on the south-eastern versant of the Sierra de Guadarrama, on the
                    borders of New Castile, about 27 miles N.W. of Madrid, and immediately to the
                    north of the railway between Madrid and Avila. Its latitude is 40° 35' N., its
                    longitude 4° Γ W., and its height above the sea 3500 feet The surrounding
                    country is a sterile and gloomy wilderness exposed to the cold and blighting
                    blasts of the Sierra. According to the usual tradition, which there seems no
                    sufficient reason to reject, the Escorial owes its existence to a vow made by
                    Philip II. of Spain shortly after the battle of St Quentin, in which his forces
                    succeeded in routing the army of France. The day of the victory, August 10,
                    1557, was sacred to St Laurence, and accordingly the building was dedicated to
                    that saint <pb break="no"

                    real</hi><hi rend="italic">Monasterio</hi><hi rend="italic">de San Lοrcnzο
                    del</hi><hi rend="italic">Escorial.</hi> The last distinctive epithet was
                    derived from the little hamlet in the vicinity which furnished shelter, not only
                    to the workmen, but to the monks of St Jerome who were afterwards to be in
                    possession of the monastery; and the hamlet itself is generally but perhaps
                    erroneously supposed to be indebted for its name to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scorioe</hi> or dross of certain old iron mines. The preparation of the plans
                    and the superintendence of the work were entrusted by the king to Juan Bautista
                    de Toledo, a Spanish architect who had received most of his professional
                    education in Italy. The first stone was laid in April 1563; and under the king’s
                    personal inspection the work rapidly advanced. Abundant supplies of berroqueña,
                    a granite-like stone, were obtained in the neighbourhood, and for rarer
                    materials the resources of both the Old and the New world were put under
                    contribution. The death of Toledo in 1567 threatened a fatal blow at the
                    satisfactory completion of the enterprise, but a worthy successor was found in
                    Juan Herrera, Toledo’s favourite pupil, who adhered in the main to his master’s
                    designs. On September 13, 1584, the lasf stone of tho masonry was laid, and the
                    works were brought to a termination in 1593. Each successive occupant of the
                    Spanish throne has done something, however slight, to the restoration or
                    adornment of Philip’s convent-palace, and Ferdinand did so much in this way that
                    he has been called a second founder. In all its principal features, however, the
                    Escorial remains what it was made by the genius of Toledo and Herrera working
                    out the grand, if abnormal desires of their dark-souled master.</p>

                <p>The ground plan of the building is said to occupy an area of 396,782 square feet,
                    and the total area of all the stories would form a causeway one metre in breadth
                    and 95 miles in length. There are seven towers, fifteen gateways, and, according
                    to Los Santos, no fewer than 12,000 windows and doors. The general arrangement
                    is shown by the accompanying plan. Entering by the main entrance the visitor
                    finds himself in an atrium, called the Court of the Kings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Patio de lοs Reyes)</hi> from the statues of the kings of Judah, by Juan
                    Bautista Monegro, which adorn the façade of the church. The sides of the atrium
                    are unfortunately occupied by plain ungainly buildings five stories in height,
                    awkwardly accommodating themselves to the upward slope of the ground. Of the
                    grandeur of the church itself, however, there can be no question: it is the
                    finest portion of the whole Escorial, and, according toFergusson, deserves to
                    rank as one of the great Renaissance churches of Europe. It is about 340 feet
                    from east to west by 200 from north to south, and thus occupies an area of about
                    70,000 square feet. The dome is 60 feet in diameter, and its height at the
                    centre is about 320 feet. In glaring contrast to the bold and simple forms of
                    the architecture, which belongs to the Doric style, were the bronze and marbles
                    and pictures of the high altar, the masterpiece of the Milanese Giacomo Trezzo,
                    almost ruined by the French. Directly under the altar is situated the pantheon
                    or royal mausoleum, a richly decorated octagonal chamber with upwards of twenty
                    niches, occupied by black marble <hi rend="italic">urnas</hi> or sarcophagi,
                    kept sacred for the dust of kings or mothers of kings. There are the remains of
                    Charles V., of Philip II., and of all their successors on the Spanish throne
                    down to Ferdinard VII., with the exception of Philip V. and Ferdinand VI.
                    Several of the sarcophagi are still empty. For the other members of the royal
                    family there is a separate vault, known as the <hi rend="italic">Panteon
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">los</hi><hi rend="italic">Infantes,</hi> or more
                    familiarly by the dreadfully suggestive name of <hi rend="italic">El
                    Padridero.</hi> The most interesting room in the palace is Philip II.’s cell,
                    from which through an opening in the wall he could see the celebration of mass
                    while too ill to leave his bed. The library, situated above the principal
                    portico, was at one time one of the richest in Europe, comprising the king’s own
                    collection, the extensive bequest of Diego de Mendoza, Philip’s ambassador to
                    Rome, the spoils of the emperor of Morocco, Muley Zidan, and various
                    contributions from convents, churches, and cities. It suffered greatly in the
                    fire of 1671, and has since been impoverished by plunder and neglect. Among its
                    curiosities still extant are an ancient Koran, a Virgil of the 10th century, an
                    Apocalypse of the 14th, <hi rend="italic">El</hi><hi rend="italic">libro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">los</hi><hi rend="italic">juegos de
                    Ajedrez,</hi> or “Book of the Games of Chess,” by Alphonso the Wise, and the
                    original Alcalà ordinance. Of the Arabic manuscripts which it contained in the
                    17th century a catalogue was given in Hottinger’s <hi rend="italic">Promptuarium
                    sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Orientalis,</hi>
                    and another in the 18th, in Casiri’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Arabico-Hispanica,</hi> 2 vols., Madrid, 1760-70. Of the artistic treasures with
                    which the Escorial was gradually enriched, it is sufficient to mention the
                    frescoes of Peregrin Tibaldi, Carbajal, Bartolome Carducho, and Lucas Jordan,
                    and the pictures of Claudio Coello, Titian, Tintoretto, Van der Weide, and
                    Velasquez. Many of those that are movable have been transferred to Madrid, and
                    many others have perished by fire or sack. The conflagration of 1671, already
                    mentioned, raged for fifteen days, and only the church, a part of the palace,
                    and two towers escaped uninjured. In 1808 the whole building was exposed to the
                    ravages of the French soldiers under Houssaye. On the night of the 1st of
                    October 1872, the college and seminary, a part of the palace, and the upper
                    library were devastated by fire; but the damage occasioned by this has in great
                    measure been repaired.</p>
