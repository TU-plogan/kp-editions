                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxan Period,</hi> 596-1066.—The early history of
                    literature in England might lend some countenance to the theory that the
                    development of a nation’s literature is, at bottom, but a chapter of its
                    religious history. While the religion of our fathers was in the main a rude
                    awe-struck worship of the forces of nature, literature either had no existence
                    for them, or was in a state not lese elementary, consisting of a few songe and
                    oracles, and nothing more. With the advent of the religion of Christ—the only
                    faith which at once recognizes the original dignity of human nature and repairs
                    its fall—came an intellectual as well as a spiritual awakening to the Teutonic
                    nations—for into such the original tribes or clans of the invaders had now
                    grown—that were planted in the old provinces of Roman Britain. Fortified by
                    gospel precept for the present life, and thrilled with the hope of the life to
                    come, the Saxon mind, released from disquietude, felt free to range discursively
                    through such regions of human knowledge as its teachers opened before it, and
                    the Saxon heart was fain to pour out many a rude but vigorous song. Pope Gregory
                    himself, who, according to the old phraseology, sent baptism to the English, is
                    said indeed to have spoken disparagingly of human learning. Bat the missionaries
                    could not fail to bring with them from Rome the intellectual culture of the
                    countries bordering on the Mediterranean, so far as it had survived the fall of
                    the Western empire and the irruption of the barbarians. The Roman alphabet,
                    paper or parchment, and pen and ink, drove out the Northern runes, the beechen
                    tablet, and the scratching implement. The necessity of the preservation, and at
                    least partial translation, of the Scriptures, the varied exigences of the
                    Catholic ritual, the demand for so much knowledge of astronomy as would enable
                    the clergy to fix beforehand the date of Easter, all favoured, or rather
                    compelled, the promotion of learning and education up to a certain point, and
                    led to continual discussion and interchange of ideas. Gratefully and eagerly our
                    forefathers drew in the warm and genial breath which came to them from the
                    intenser life and higher enlightenment of the south. Beda dates his history by
                    the indictions of the Eastern emperors; and while in practice he obeyed his
                    native king descended from Woden, in theory he recognized the larger and more
                    rational sway of the Caesar enthroned at Constantinople.</p>
                <p>On a closer examination, we find that there were two principal centres, during
                    the first two centuries after the conversion, where learning was honoured and
                    literature flourished. These centres were Wessex and Northumbria. For although
                    Christianity was first preached in Kent, and the great monastery at Canterbury
                    was long a valuable school of theology and history (witness the liberal praise
                    awarded by Beda to Abbot Albinus in the preface to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiastical History),</hi> yet the limited size of the kingdom, and the ill
                    fortune which befell it in its wars with Mercia and Wessex, seem to have chocked
                    its intellectual growth. When we have named the oldest form of the Saxon
                    Chronicle,—that represented by the Parker MS. A,—and the not very interesting
                    works of Abbot Aelfric, there is little left in the shape of extant writings,
                    dating before the Conquest, for which we have to thank the men of Kent. But in
                    Wessex and Northumbria alike, the size of the territory, the presence of
                    numerous monasteries, perhaps also the proximity of Celtic peoples or societies
                    endowed with many literary gifts,—the Britons in the case of Wessex, the Culdees
                    of Iona in the case of Northumbria,— co-operated to produce.a long period of
                    literary activity, the monuments of which it must now be our endeavour briefly
                    to review and characterize.</p>
                <p>But before we consider the Anglo-Saxon literature which was founded on
                    Christianity, the question whether any Anglo-Saxon literature exists of date
                    prior to the conversion demands an answer. It was formerly thought that the
                    important poem of <hi rend="italic">Beowulf</hi> was in the main a pagan work,
                    and must have been produced before the Angles and Saxons quitted their German
                    homes; but closer investigation has shown that it is permeated almost everywhere
                    by Christian ideas, and that it cannot be dated earlier than the first quarter
                    of the 8th century. But two poems remain, presenting problems of great
                    difficulty, many of which have not yet been satisfactorily solved, which so far
                    as appears must have been composed in Germany while our forefathers were still
                    in their German seats. These are <hi rend="italic">The Travellers Song</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Bear’s Complaint.</hi> In the first, Widsith, a poet of
                    Myrging race (the Myrgings were a tribe dwelling near the Eider), re-counts the
                    nations that he had visited as a travelling gleeman, names the kings who ruled
                    over them, and singles out two or three whose open-handed generosity he had
                    experienced, and to whom he accordingly awards the tribute of a poet’s praise.
                    This poem may perhaps be dated from the second half of the 6th century. Though
                    written in or near Anglen, after the migration of most of the Angles to Britain,
                    the language of the poem seems to have been accommodated to the ordinary
                    West-Saxon dialect, for in this respect it differs in no degree from the other
                    poems which stand before and after it in the Exeter Codex. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dear’s Camplaint</hi> mentions Weland, the Teutonic demi-god corresponding to
                    Vulcan, Theodric, Eormanric, &amp;c.; it is the lament of a bard supplanted by a
                    rival in his lord’s favour. In date it is probably not far distant from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traveller's Sang.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript smallcaps">
                    λ</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Nq</hi> may now return to the literary
                    development in Wessex. Christianity was introduced into Wessex by Bishop Birinus
                    in 634, and spread over the whole kingdom with marvellous celerity. The bishop’s
                    see was fixed at first at Dorchester, near Oxford; thence it was moved to
                    Winchester; before the end of the century it was necessary to carve out another
                    bishopric farther to the west, and the see was fixed at Sherborne. Winchester,
                    Malmesbury, and Glastonbury were great and famous monasteries early in the 8th
                    century. The heroic Winfrid (better known as St Boniface), trained in a
                    monastery at Exeter, could not rest contented that Wessex should have received
                    the faith, but carried Christianity to the Germans. Great spiritual fervour,
                    ardent zeal, great intellectual activity, seems to have prevailed in every part
                    of the little kingdom. The interesting letters of St Boniface give us
                    tantalizing glimpses of a busy life, social and monastic, in the west of
                    England, no detailed picture of which it is now possible to reconstruct. The
                    most distinguished known writer was St Aldhelm, a monk of Malmesbury, and, for a
                    few years before his death in 709, bishop of Sherborne. His extant works in
                    Latin are chiefly in praise of virginity, that form of self-mastery which,
                    difficult as it was for a people teeming with undeveloped power and unexhausted
                    passion, included, he might think, aud made possible every other kind of
                    self-mastery. The Saxon writings of St Aidhelm are lost, unless we accept a
                    conjecture of Grimm that he was the author of <hi rend="italic">Andreas,</hi>
                    one of the poems in the Vercelli Codex. Cynewulf, the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Crist, Elene,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Juliana,</hi> though to
                    us unhappily no more than a name, was a poet of no mean powers. Mr Kemble was
                    disposed to identify him with an abbot of Peterborough who lived <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n423/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0423-0404"/> in the 11th century; but it is far more
                    probable,—whatever weight we may attach to Grimm’s hypothesis that he was a
                    pupil of St Aldhelm,—that Cynewulf was a West-Saxon writer, and lived in the
                    first half of the 8th century. <hi rend="italic">Crût</hi> is a poem of nearly
                    1700 lines, incomplete at the beginning. When first edited by Mr Thorpe along
                    with the other contents of the Exeter Codex, it was believed to be a string of
                    disconnected poems. Dietrich was the first who pointed out the internal
                    connection of these, and showed that they constituted one organic whole.
                    Cynewulf seems to revel in the task of expressing in his mother tongue the new
                    religious ideas which had come to his race. Beginning from the Annunciation, he
                    expatiates on the various and inestimable benefits which Christ by his
                    incarnation bestowed on men, concluding with a vivid picture of the last great
                    day of account. The key-note of the poem seems to be found in the 15th canto,
                    where the six “leaps,” or movements, of Christ are enumerated :—the first, when
                    He became incarnate; the second, when He was born; the third, when He mounted on
                    the cross, and so on. The name “Cynewulf” is given in runes in the 16th canto;
                    it occurs in the same way in the other poems attributed to this writer. <hi
                    rend="italic">Elene</hi> is the legend of the discovery of the true cross at
                    Jerusalem by the empress Helena, the mother of Constantine; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Juliana</hi> is the story of the martyrdom of the saint so named, under
                    Maximian. <hi rend="italic">Guthlac,</hi> a free version of the Latin life of St
                    Guthlac (who died in 714) by Felix, a monk of Croyland, is probably the work of
                    a Mercian writer, whose language was altered by a West-Saxon transcriber into
                    conformity with that of the poems already mentioned. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andreas,</hi> a poem of more than 1700 lines, ascribed by Grimm, as we have
                    seen, to St Aidhelm, but at any rate a West-Saxon poem of the 8th century, is
                    founded on an apocryphal Greek narrative of the “Acts of Andrew and Matthew.”
                    The first-named apostle, after rescuing the second from confinement in a
                    barbarous land named Mermedonia, and working numerous miracles of an amazing
                    character, converts the entire nation, and departs after committing them to the
                    charge of a pious bishop named Plato.</p>
                <p>All the poems hitherto named, and indeed the great mass of Anglo-Saxon poetry,
                    are written in that alliterative metre which was the favourite rhythm of the
                    whole Teutonic north, and of which one variety may be seen in the famous poems
                    of the Edda. Each line is in two sections, balanced the one against the other,
                    and containing usually from four to eight syllables and two accents. The general
                    rule of the metre is that the two accented words in the first section, and one
                    of those in the second section, begin upon the <hi rend="italic">same</hi>
                    letter, if a consonant, but, if the accented words begin with vowels, then upon
                    <hi rend="italic">different</hi> letters.</p>
                <p>The preponderance of opinion is now in favour of ascribing to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beowulf,</hi> the most important surviving monument of Anglo-Saxon poetry, a
                    West-Saxon origin, and a date not later than the middle, nor earlier than the
                    first decade, of the 8th century. Yet the difficulty of the problem may be
                    estimated from the facts, that Thorkelin, the first editor, described <hi
                    rend="italic">Beowulf</hi> as a “Danish poem,” that Mr Kemble, wrongly
                    identifying the Geatas with the Angles, believed it to have been composed in
                    Anglen before the migration, and brought over to Wessex before the end of the
                    5th century, and that Mr Thorpe considered it to be merely a translation of a
                    Swedish poem of the 11th century. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the general
                    view taken above is that of Grein, Müllenhoff, and other eminent scholars, and
                    we are convinced that the further investigation is carried the more firmly will
                    its soundness be established. Founded on a single MS., which, as originally
                    written, was full of errors, and now is much defaced, the text of <hi
                    rend="italic">Beowulf</hi> can never, unless another MS. should be discovered,
                    be placed on a thoroughly satisfactory footing; much, however, has been done for
                    its improvement by the labours of German and Danish critics. The general drift
                    of the poem is to celebrate the heroic deeds of Beowulf, who, originally of
                    Swedish race, was adopted by the king of Gautlaud, or Gotland (as the southern
                    portion of Sweden is still called), and brought up with his own sons. Hearing
                    that the Danish king Hrothgar is harassed by the attacks of a man-eating monster
                    called Grendel, he sails to Zealand to his aid, and after various adventures
                    kills both Grendel and his mother. After this Beowulf is chosen king of Gotland,
                    and reigns many years in great prosperity, till in his old age, undertaking to
                    fight with a fiery dragon that has been making great ravages among his subjects,
                    he succeeds in killing it, but receives a mortal injury in the struggle. The
                    burning of his body, and the erection of a huge mound or cairn over his ashes,
                    as a beacon “easy to be seen far off by seafaring men,” conclude the poem, and
                    form a passage of remarkable beauty.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the 8th century the descents of the piratical heathens known
                    by the general name of Danes, but probably born for the most part in
                    Scandinavian countries lying to the north of Denmark, began to plague the
                    English coasts. These destroying savages resembled the modern Turks in
                    possessing fine military qualities, and above all indomitable courage; they were
                    also like the Turks in this respect that, wherever they set their foot, progress
                    of every kind was arrested, culture was blasted, and the hopes of civilization
                    died away. Fortunately they were not, like the Turks, absolutely deaf to the
                    voice of the Christian missionary, though their natural brutishness made them
                    difficult to convert and prone to relapse. With incredible pains, and a charity
                    that nothing could disgust or deter, the church gradually won over these
                    Scandinavian Calibans to the Christian creed; and when once converted their
                    immense natural energy and tenacity were turned into right and beneficial
                    channels, at least in great measure. But for 230 years,—from the sack of
                    Lindisfarne to the accession of Canute,—the so-called Danes were the curse of
                    England, destroying monasteries and the schools maintained by them, burning
                    churches and private houses, making life and property everywhere insecure, and
                    depriving the land of that tranquillity without which literature and art are
                    impossible. After a long prevalence of this state of things, society in Wessex
                    having been, one would think, almost reduced to its first elements, Alfred
                    arose, and after obtaining some successes in battle over the Danes, leading to a
                    treaty and the conversion of part of them to Christianity, obtained a period of
                    peace for his harassed and dejected countrymen. History tells us how well he
                    wrought to build up in every way the fallen edifice of West-Saxon society. Among
                    his labours not the least meritorious was his translation of Beda’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Ecclesiastica,</hi> Pope Gregory’s work <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Cura</hi><hi rend="italic">Pastorali,</hi> the famous treatise of Boethius
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Universal History</hi> of Orosius. He also founded several
                    schools, and made a beginning in the work of restoring monasteries. Yet in spite
                    of his generous efforts, the evils caused by the Danes could not be repaired. A
                    sort of blight seemed to have passed over the Anglo-Saxon genius; the claims of
                    material existence suddenly seemed to engross their thoughts, perhaps because
                    their sufferings had taught them that, however it may be with individuals, for
                    nations all higher developments must have a basis of material prosperity to rest
                    upon. Now and then a great man appeared, endowed with a reparative force, and
                    with a courage which aimed at raising the fallen spirit of the people, and
                    turning them back again into the old paths of nobleness.</p>

                <p>Such a man was St Dunstan, who fought with a giant’s strength against corruption,
                    sloth, and ignorance, and was ever faithful to the interests of learning. There
                    is in the Bodleian Library a little volume, probably written in his own hand; it
                    is a sort of common-place book; the frontispiece is a drawing of the saint
                    prostrated at the feet of the throned Christ, executed by Dunstan himself; among
                    the contents of the volume are—a grammatical treatise by Eutychius, w ith
                    extremely curious Welsh glosses, part of Ovid <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amandi</hi> with similar glosses, and lessons, in Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">and Greek,</hi> taken from the Pentateuch and the prophets. But
                    his work was undone during the disastrous reign of Ethelred IL, at the end of
                    which the Danish power established itself in England. Under Edward the
                    Confessor, French influences began to be greatly felt. The two races of the
                    Teutonic north had torn each other to pieces, and the culture which Saxon had
                    been able to impart to Northman was uot sufficient to discipline him into a
                    truly civilized man. England, though at a terrible cost, had to be knit on to
                    the state-system of Southern Europe; her anarchy must give place to
                    centralization; her schools, and her art, and her architecture be remodelled by
                    Italians and Frenchmen; her poets turn their eyes, not towards Iceland, but
                    towards Normandy or Provence.</p>
                <p>Turning now to the other literary centre, the Northumbrian kingdom, we find that
                    impulse and initiation were due to more than one source. In the main, the
                    conversion of the Angles north of the Tees, and the implantation among them of
                    the germs of culture, are traceable to Iona, and, indirectly, to the Iriβh
                    Church and St Patrick. From Ireland, in the persons of St Columba and his
                    followers, was wafted to the long low island surrounded by the mountains of the
                    Hebrides, a ministry of light and civilization, which from the 6th to the 11th
                    century diffused its blessings over northern Europe. Oswald, son of the
                    Bernician king Ethelfrid, was driven out of Northumbria after his father’s death
                    by Edwin of Deira, and took refuge among the northern Picts. He embraced
                    Christianity through the teaching of the monks of Iona or some monastery
                    dependent on it; and when he became king of Bernicia in 634, one of his first
                    thoughts was to send to his old teachers, and ask that missionaries might be
                    sent to instruct his people. Aidan accordingly came from Iona and founded a
                    bishop’s see at Lindisfarne, or Holy Isle. Hence issued the fouuders of the
                    monasteries of Hexham, Cυldingham, Whitby, and many other places. The actual
                    representatives of the monks of Iona returned after some years to their own
                    country, because they would not give way in the dispute concerning Easter; but
                    the civilizing effects of their mission did not pass away. The school of piety
                    and learning which produced an Aidan, an Adamnan, and a Cuthbert deserved well
                    not of England only but of humanity. Adamnan, abbot of Iona about the year 690,
                    has a peculiar interest for us, because a long extract from his work on the holy
                    places is incorporated by Beda in his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    History.</hi> He also wrote a life of his founder, St Columba, printed by
                    Canisius and in the <hi rend="italic">FlorUegium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Insuloe</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanctorum.</hi> To the encouragement of Bishop
                    Aidan we owe it that Hilda, a lady of the royal house of Deira, established
                    monasteries at Hartlepool and Streoneshalch (afterwards Whitby); and it was by
                    the m0nk3 of Streoneshalch that the seed was sown, which, falling upon a good
                    heart and a capacious brain, bore fruit in the poetry of Caedmon, the earliest
                    English poet. We need not repeat the well-known story of the vision, in which
                    the destined bard, then a humble menial employed about the stables and
                    boat-service of the monastery, believed that an injunction of more than mortal
                    authority was laid upon him, to “sing of the beginning of creation.” The impulse
                    having been once communicated, Caedmon, as Beda informs us, continued for a long
                    time to clothe in his native measures the principal religious facts recorded in
                    the Pentateuch and in the New Testament. Is the work commonly known as Caedmon’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Paraphrase</hi> identical with the work described by Beda?
                    Have we in this paraphrase a genuine utterance of the 7th century? The answers
                    to these questions are still involved in doubt, and to enter upon the discussion
                    which they presuppose would be foreign to our present purpose. We will merely
                    say that the unique MS. of the <hi rend="italic">Paraphrase,</hi> which is of
                    the 10th century, contains no indication whatever of authorship, and that it
                    opens in a manner different from the prologue made by the real Caedmon, of which
                    we have a Latin version in Beda and an Anglo-Saxon version in Alfred’s
                    translation of Beda. On the other hand, the portion of the MS. which is written
                    in the first hand agrees tolerably well in its contents with the real work of
                    Caedmon, as Beda describes it. The portion of the MS. which is written in the
                    second hand is probably of much later date; some critics have not hesitated to
                    designate its author as the “pseudo-Caedmon.” The opening cantos of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Para· phrase,</hi> which treat of the rebellion of the angels and
                    the fall of man, are allowed by general consent to be those most vividly
                    expressed, and most characterized by poetical power. It is here that bright
                    strong phrases occur, which, as is believed, Milton himself did not disdain to
                    utilize, and his known acquaintance with Francis Junius, the then possessor of
                    the Caedmon MS., seems to lend some countenance to the belief.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the influences in Northumbria tending to culture have been found to be
                    ouly indirectly Roman; the immediate source of them was Iona. But when we come
                    to the Venerable Beda, the great light of the Northumbrian church, the glory of
                    letters in a rude and turbulent age, nay, even the teacher and the beacon light
                    of all Europe for the period from the 7th to the 10th century, we find that the
                    fountain whence he drew the streams of thought and knowledge came from no
                    derivative source, but was supplied directly from the well-head of Christian
                    culture. Benedict Biscop, a young Northumbrian thane, much employed and favoured
                    in the court of Oswy, abandoned the world for the church, and travelling to Rome
                    resided there several years, diligently studying the details of ecclesiastical
                    life and training, and the institutes of liturgical order. Returning to England
                    in 668, with Theodore, the new primate, and the abbot Hadriau, he brought into
                    Northumbria a large number of books, relics, and other ecclesiastical objects,
                    and, being warmly welcomed by King Egfrid, founded a monastery in honour of St
                    Peter on land granted by the king at the mouth of the Wear. That the other great
                    apostolic name venerated at Rome might not go λvithout due honour, he built a
                    second monastery soon afterwards in honour of St Paul at Jarrow on the Tyne,
                    seven miles from Wearmouth. After the founder’s time the two monasteries were
                    usually governed by one abbot. When only seven years old, Beda, like Orderic in
                    a later age, was brought by his father to Jarrow, and given up to the abbot to
                    be trained to monastic life. The rest of his life, down to the year 731, was
                    passed in the monastery, as we know from his own statement; in 735 he died. His
                    works, which have several times been edited in a complete form abroad, but never
                    yet in his own country, may be grouped under five heads—1, Educational; 2,
                    Theological; 3, Historical; 4, Poetical; 5, Letters. To the first class belong
                    the treatises <hi rend="italic">De Orthographia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De
                    Arte</hi><hi rend="italic">Metrica,</hi> the first being a short dictionary,
                    giving the correct spelling and the idiomatic use of a considerable number of
                    Latin words, with (in many cases) their Greek equivalents,—the second a prosody,
                    describing the principal classical metres, with examples. <hi rend="italic"

                    and maps. A number of treatises, of which the most important are <hi

                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Ratione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Computi,</hi> fall under the same head; their general object being to elucidate
                    all questions connected with the ecclesiastical calendar and the right
                    calculation of Easter. Under the second head, that of theological works, fall
                    his <hi rend="italic">Expositiones</hi> on St Mark’s and St Luke’s Gospels, on
                    the A cts, and other books of the New Testament, his homilies, forty-nine in
                    number, and a book of Prayers, chiefly made up of verses taken from the Psalms.
                    Under the head of “Historical lives of five abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow, a
                    life of St Cuthbert, another of St Felix, bishop of Nola, and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Martyrology,</hi> which has several times been printed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> opens with a preface, in which, in
                    that tone of calmness and mild dignity which go far to make a perfect prose
                    style, Beda explains in detail the nature and the sources of the evidence on
                    which he has relied in compiling the work. Λ short introduction then sketches
                    the general history of Britain from the landing of Julius Caesar to the coming
                    of Augustine, giving special details respecting the martyrdom of St Alban under
                    Diocletian, and the missionary preaching of St Germanus of Auxerre in the 5th
                    century. From the landing of Augustine in 596 to the year 731, the progress of
                    Christianity, the successes and the reverses of the church in the arduous work
                    of bringing within her pale the fiercely warring nations of the Heptarchy, are
                    narrated, fully but unsystematically, for each kingdom of the Heptarchy in turn.
                    A short sketch of “Universal History,” forming the latter portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Ratiοne</hi><hi rend="italic">Temporum,</hi> has been treated
                    by the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Brit,</hi> as if it were a separate work, and printed, with the title <hi
                    rend="italic">De Sex</hi><hi rend="italic">Aetatibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mundi,</hi> in that useful but unwieldy volume. Among the poetical works are a
                    life of St Cuthbert in Latin hexameters, a number of hymns, most of which are
                    written in the lively iambic metre of which a familiar instance is the hymn
                    beginning “Vexilla regis prodeunt,” a poem on Justin Martyr in a trochaic metre,
                    and another in hexameters on the Day of Judgment. This last seems to have been
                    much admired; Simeon of Durham copied it entire into his history. The
                    versification of this remarkable poem has considerable merits; in that respect
                    it is not more than three hundred years behind Claudian. But when we come to the
                    spirit of the poem, and think of the moral atmosphere which it implies, and aims
                    at extending, we see that ten thousand years would not adequately measure the
                    chasm which divides the monastic poets from the last “vates” of heathen Rome.
                    For the key-note of Beda’s poem is the sense of sin; whatever is expressed by
                    the words compunction, penance, expiation, heart-crushing sorrow for having
                    offended God, trust in the one Redeemer, pervades all his lines; and we need not
                    say how alien is all this to the spirit of the poets, who, with little thought
                    of individual and personal reformation, staked their all in the future upon the
                    greatness and stability of Rome. “Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.”
                    The letters, most of which are merely the dedications and addresses prefixed to
                    some of his works, refer little to contemporary events; two or three, however,
                    are of great interest.</p>
                <p>At the time when Beda died (735), the Angles of Northumbria were beginning to lay
                    aside the use of arms, and zealously to frequent the monastery schools; among
                    their princes, as among those of Wessex, some were found to exchange a crown for
                    a cowl and a throne for a cell. But a reaction set in; perhaps some had tried
                    asceticism who had no vocation for it; and after the middle of the century
                    Northumbrian history is darkened by the frequent record of dissension among the
                    members of the royal house, civil war, and assassination. On this state of
                    things came the ravages of the Northmen, and made it incurable. Lindisfarne,
                    with all its treasures and collections, was destroyed by them in 793. This is
                    but a sample of the havoc wrought by those barbarians; yet for a long time many
                    monasteries escaped; and, in particular, that of York was a centre of learning
                    far on into the 9th century, probably till the disastrous battle occurred before
                    York, described in the Saxon Chronicle under 867. At this monastery Alcuin was
                    educated, and when grown up he had charge of its school and library. In 780 he
                    was sent on a mission to Rome; on his return, at Parma, he fell in with the
                    emperor Charlemagne, who invited him to settle at Aix-la-Chapelle, at that time
                    the chief imperial residence, to teach his children, and aid in the organization
                    of education throughout his dominions. Having obtained the permission of his
                    superiors at York, Alcuin complied with the request; and from that time to his
                    death, in 804, resided, with little intermission, either at the imperial court
                    or at Tours. Alenin’s letters, though the good man was of a somewhat dry and
                    pedantic turn, contain much matter of interest. His extant works are of
                    considerable bulk; they are chiefly educational and theological treatises, which
                    for lack of vigour or originality of treatment have fallen into complete
                    oblivion. What is still of value in the works of Alcuin is, besides the letters,
                    the lives of St Willibrord, the English apostle of Friesland, St Vedast, and St
                    Richer.</p>
                <p>After the death of Alcuin, the confusion in Northumbria became ever worse and
                    worse, for the Danes forced their way into the land, and many years passed
                    before the two nations could agree to live on friendly terms together side by
                    side. But for the <hi rend="italic">Durham Gospels,</hi> a version in the Angle
                    dialect of the four gospels, and a few similar remains, the north of England
                    presents a dead blank to the historian of literature from Alcuin to Simeon of
                    Durham, a period of more than three hundred years. In the south, as we have
                    seen, the resistance to the intrusion of the barbarian element was more
                    successful, and the intellectual atmosphere far less dark. The works of Aelfric,
                    who died archbishop of Canterbury in 1006, are the last subject of consideration
                    in the present section. They are chiefly interesting because they show the
                    growing importance of the native language. Aelfric’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homilies</hi> are in Anglo-Saxon; his <hi rend="italic">Colloquy</hi> is a
                    conversation on common things, in Latin and Anglo-Saxon, between a master and
                    his scholar; his <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> adapted from Priscian and
                    Donatus, has for its object to teach Latin to Anglo-Saxons; its editorial and
                    didactic part is therefore iu Anglo-Saxon. The annals of public events, to
                    which, as collected and arranged by Archbishop Plegmund at the end of the 9th
                    century, we give the name of the <hi rend="italic">Saxon Chronicle,</hi>
                    continued to be recorded at Canterbury in the native language till about the
                    date of the Conquest; after that time the task passed into the hands of the
                    monks of Peterborough, and was carried on by them for nearly a hundred years. A
                    work of collecting and transcribing the remains of the national poetry began, of
                    which the priceless volume known as the <hi rend="italic">Exeter Codex,</hi>
                    given by bishop Leofric to the library of Exeter cathedral in the reign of
                    Edward the Çonfessor, is the monument and the fruit. The collection contained in
                    the manuscript discovered about fifty years ago at Vercelli was probably made
                    about the same time. Tn these two collections are contained the works of
                    Cynewulf, the <hi rend="italic">Traveller's Song, Guthlac, Andreas,</hi> the
                    poem on the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix,</hi> &lt;fcc. Being thus made more widely
                    known, the ancient poems would soon have found imitators, and a fresh
                    development of Anglo-Saxon poetry would have been the result. Had there been no
                    violent change, England would by slow degrees have got through with the task of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n426/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0426-0407"/> assimilating and taming the Northmen; and, in
                    spite of physical isolation, would have participated, though probably lagging
                    far behind the rest, in the general intellectual advance of the nations of
                    Europe. The tissue of her civilization would have been, in preponderating
                    measure, Teutonic, like that of Germany; but it would have lacked the golden
                    thread of the “Holy Roman Empire,” which brought an element of idealism and
                    beauty into the plain texture of German life. For good or for evil, the process
                    of national and also of intellectual development was to be altered and quickened
                    by the arrival of a knightly race of conquerors from across the channel.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Norman Period,</hi> 1066-1215.—The 11tlι century is
                    remarkably barren in great names and memories which captivate the imagination;
                    it was, however, an advance upon the 10th, which Baronius has described as the
                    central and worst period of intellectual darkness. In England, for about 150
                    years after the Conquest, there was no unity of intellectual life; in political
                    life, however, the iron hand of the Conqueror compelled an external uniformity,
                    by the universal exaction of homage to himself. The strength of the Norman
                    monarchy, the absence of religious differences, and, after a time, the loss of
                    Normandy, were causes working powerfully in aid of the conciliation and
                    interfusion of the different elements of the population. But at first it was as
                    if three separate nations were encamped confusedly on British soil,—the Normans,
                    the English, and the Welsh. The clergy, as a fourth power, of all nationalities
                    or of none, became,—by its use of Latin as a common tongue, by preaching a
                    common faith and teaching a common philosophy, and as representing the equality
                    and charity which are among the essential features of Christianity,—an ever
                    present mediating influence tending to break down the partitions between the
                    camps. The intellectual state and progress of each nation, down to and a little
                    beyond the end of the 12th century, must now be briefly discussed.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Normans.—</hi> In less than two centuries after the Northmen
                    under Rollo had settled in Normandy, they had not only exchanged their Teutonic
                    speech for the language of France, but made,—with French as the medium of
                    expression,—remarkable literary progress, In this progress the Normans settled
                    in England participated to the full. It is probable that the Turoldus, who,
                    availing himself of earlier Frankish lays and chronicles, composed towards the
                    end of the 11th century the noble heroic poem called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chanson de Poland,</hi> was an abbot of Peterborough, son of the clerk of the
                    same name who was the Conqueror’s preceptor. From the reign of Henry I., though
                    the names of several writers are known, little of importance has come down to
                    us. The treatise on politeness called <hi rend="italic">Urbanus,</hi> attributed
                    to Henry himself, is in all probability the composition of a later age. The
                    works of the hapless satirist, Luc de la Barre, are not extant, and Evrard’s
                    translation (1130) of Cato’s <hi rend="italic">Disticha</hi> into French verse
                    is not a noteworthy performance. The reign of Stephen, though confusion and
                    civil war prevailed over a great part of England, witnessed an extraordinary
                    outburst of literary activity. Of the historians who shed a lustre on this reign
                    we shall speak in a different connexion; but it was also memorable for its
                    French poets. Guichard of Beaulieu, a cell of St Alban’s (1150), produced a poem
                    in Alexandrines of some merit, on the vices of the age; Geoffrey Gaimar (1140)
                    wrote his lively <hi rend="italic">Estorie des Engles</hi> (a chronicle of the
                    Anglo-Saxon kings); and Benoit de Ste More, either in this reign or early in
                    that of Henry IL, produced a vast poem on the <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    War of Troy,</hi> which seems to have been the original exemplar on which the
                    numerous “Troy-books” of later generations were modelled. The family of Benoit
                    was of Norman extraction, but settled in England. Under Henry IL, whose
                    ceaseless and enlightened energy stimulated production wherever it was exerted,
                    French poetry took an ever bolder sweep. Robert Wace, a native of Jersey and a
                    clerk of Caen, composed about 1155 his famous <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">T Angleterre,</hi> a history of the kings of Britain from Brutus
                    to Cadwallader, founded on the <hi rend="italic">Historia Britonum</hi> of
                    Geoffrey of Monmouth. Again, when Henry had commissioned Benoit to write a
                    metrical history of the dukes of Normandy, the quick-witted Wace anticipated his
                    slower rival, and produced in 1160 the first part of the <hi rend="italic">Roman
                    de Pou,</hi> treating of the same subject.</p>
                <p>Thus far we have considered the Anglo-Norman poets chiefly as chroniclers; we
                    have now to regard them as romance writers. It is true that in their hands
                    history slides into romance, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> thus the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brut (V</hi><hi rend="italic">Angleterre</hi> may be regarded as
                    historical in so far as it treats of the series of British kings, mythical as
                    that series itself may be, but as a romance in most of that portion of it which
                    is devoted to the adventures of Arthur. We here enter upon a wide field; the
                    stores of Arthurian, Carlovingian, and general chivalrous romance suggest
                    themselves to the mind; a thousand interesting inquiries present themselves; but
                    the limits traced for us prescribe a treatment little more than <hi
                    rend="italic">allusive;</hi> that is, French romance can only be described in
                    virtue of the stimulating and suggestive effect which it had on English writers.
                    This effect was produced in a measure by great poems like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandreis</hi> (1200), by the original French romances on Charlemagne and his
                    peers, and by that on the third crusade and the prowess of King Richard. But the
                    romances relating to Arthur, doubtless on account of the extent to which they
                    really sprang from British soil, were those which most profoundly stirred the
                    English mind. It is not difficult to trace the steps by which the legend grew.
                    Gildas, writing in the 6th century, knows of Arthur’s victory at Mount Badon,
                    but does not name him. Nennius, whose date is uncertain, but who should probably
                    be assigned to the 9th century, mentions the same victory as one of several
                    which were gained by “the magnanimous Arthur” over the Saxon invader. Three
                    centuries pass, and the story comes to us again, greatly amplified, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">British History</hi> of Geoffrey of Monmouth (1126). This history,
                    Geoffrey assures us, was founded upon a book in the Breton language, brought
                    over from Britanny by an archdeacon of Oxford. Ritson scouted the assertion as
                    fictitious, yet it was probably true; and the supposition of a Breton origin for
                    his history is exactly what would best account for .the great development which
                    we find the Arthur legend to have now attained, in comparison with the age of
                    Nennius. For Britanny was the fruitful parent of numberless forms of imaginative
                    fiction,—a trait noticed by Chaucer:</p>
                <p>“These olde gentil Bretons in their daies, Of divers aventures maden laies and
                    what character would the Breton bards be more likely to embellish than that of
                    the hero king, who, during and before the migration of their forefathers, had
                    made such a gallant stand against the Saxon? Yet, though Geoffrey has so much to
                    tell us of Arthur, he is silent about the Round Table. That splendid feature of
                    the legend first appears in the <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi> of Wace, and was
                    probably derived from Breton poems or traditions to which Geoffrey had not
                    access. Layamon reproduces it, with additional details, in his version of Wace.
                    Other branches of Arthurian romance, especially those relating to Tristan and
                    Perceval, became about this time widely popular; it is to this period also that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Chevalier du Lion</hi> of Chrétien de Troyes belongs.
                    Suddenly there is a great change. A <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n427/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0427-0408"/> cycle of romance, which till now had breathed
                    only of revenge, slaughter, race-hatreds, unlawful love, magic, and witchcraft,
                    becomes transformed in a few years into a series of mystical legends,
                    symbolizing and teaching one of the profoundest dogmas of the Catholic creed.
                    This strange effect was produced by the infusion into the Arthur legend of the
                    conception of the <hi rend="italic">Saint Craal,</hi> the holy vessel used by
                    Christ at the Last Supper, and containing drops of his blood, which Joseph of
                    Arimathea was said to have brought into Britain. This transformation seems to
                    have been executed by Walter Map, the remarkable Welshman whose genius
                    decisively colours the intellectual history of the last forty years of the 12 th
                    century. Map is said to have written a Latin history of the Graal, which is not
                    now extant; yet from it all the authors of the French prose romances on Arthur
                    and the Saint Graal which appeared between 1170 and 1230—Robert de Borron, his
                    kinsman Hélie, Luc de Gast, and Map himself—profess to have translated their
                    compositions. The chief of these works are the <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,
                    Merlin,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Quest of the Saint Graal, Lancelot,
                    Tristan,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mort Artur.</hi> In all, to “achieve the
                    Saint Graal,” that is, to find or see the holy vessel which, on account of the
                    sins of men, had long since vanished from Britain, is represented as the height
                    of chivalrous ambition: but among all Arthur’s knights, only Sir Galahad, the
                    son of Lancelot, is sufficiently pure in heart to be favoured with the sublime
                    vision. English versions, more or less literal, of these romances, among which
                    may be named the works of Lonelich and Sir Thomas Malory, and the alliterative
                    poem of <hi rend="italic">Joseph of Arimathie,</hi> attest the great and
                    enduring popularity of the Graal form of Arthurian legend.</p>
                <p>2. After a long period of silence, the bardic poetry of Wales broke out, just
                    when the independence of the nation was about to be extinguished, into
                    passionate and varied utterance. The princes who struggled successfully against
                    the attacks of Henry II. found gifted bards—Gwalchmai, Elidir, Gwiυn, &amp;c.—to
                    celebrate in fiercely patriotic strains their imperfect triumphs. A translation
                    of one of Gwalchmai’s odes may be found, under the title of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Triumph of Given,</hi> among Gray’s poems. Supposed “Prophecies of
                    Merlin,” a sample of which may be seen in the strange work of Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth, fed the popular belief that Arthur yet lived, and would return one day
                    to Wales as a deliverer. Both the <hi rend="italic">Triads</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mabinogion</hi> refer in part to Arthur, but from different
                    stand-points. In the <hi rend="italic">Triads</hi> such mention as there is of
                    him represents him as a British king, doing battle with the foes of his race,
                    and full of a sententious wit and wisdom. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mabinogion</hi> the indigenous Welsh view is overpowered by that of the Norman
                    trouvères; we have the Arthur, not of history or tradition, but of chivalry; the
                    mysterious Saint Graal proves as attractive to the Celtic as to the Teutonic
                    imagination. Three of the romances by Chrétien de Troyes appear in a Welsh dress
                    among the tales of the <hi rend="italic">Mabinogion.</hi> After the loss of
                    independence under Edward I., the importance and originality of Welsh literature
                    appear to have progressively declined.</p>
                <p>3. The English-speaking portion—that is, the great mass—of the population, down
                    to the reign of John, has left few literary traces of its existence. Whoever
                    wished to move amongst the educated and cultured classes, and to associate with
                    persons of rank, authority, or influence, found it necessary, though he might be
                    descended from Alfred himself, to speak French in good society, and to write in
                    French whatever he wished good society to read. From the Conquest to 1200, the
                    industry of the most lynx-eyed antiquary has discovered—with the exception of
                    the continuation of the Saxon Chronicle—no literary record in English beyond a
                    few short fragments, such as the lines preserved as a part of Canute’s song by
                    Thomas of Ely, the prophecy of Here, and the hymn of St Godric. The continuation
                    beyond the Conquest of the Saxon Chronicle was made by the monks of
                    Peterborough. It is not complete for the reign of Stephen, passing over several
                    years <hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi rend="italic">silentio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but it records the accession of Henry II. in 1154, and then ends
                    abruptly. The writer or writers were perhaps unable to stand up any longer
                    against the then universal fashion of employing Latin for any serious prose
                    work. Moreover, as the Anglo-Saxon was no longer taught in schools nor spoken in
                    the higher circles of society, it had lost much of its original harmony and
                    precision of structure; and “when the annalist found himself using one inflexion
                    for another, or dropping inflexions altogether, he may well have thought it high
                    time to exchange a tongue which seemed to be crumbling and breaking up, for one
                    whose forms were fixed and its grammar rational. Little did the down-hearted
                    monk anticipate the future glories which, after a crisis of transformation and
                    fusion, would surround his rude ancestral tongue.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>A few years after the beginning of the 13th century we have to note the
                    appearance of an important and interesting work in English,—Layamon’e <hi
                    rend="italic">Brut.</hi> But it can scarcely be said to belong to English
                    literature, unless <hi rend="italic">Beoιvulf</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Judith</hi> be similarly classified, for the language is almost as purely
                    Teutonic as in these. In the older version of the <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi>
                    not more than fifty words of Latin or French origin have been found; and of
                    these several were in common use in England before the Conquest. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Brut</hi> is strictly a monument of the age of transition. We need
                    not, with some writers, call the language “semi-Saxon;” it is certainly English,
                    and, from a particular point of view, purer English than we speak now; but it is
                    not that form of English which, from first to last, has been the instrument
                    employed to build up English literature. That form, as we shall see in the next
                    section, was determined and conditioned by the necessity of effecting a
                    compromise between the speech of the governors and that of the governed, so that
                    the new standard English should remain, as to its grammatical framework,
                    comparatively intact, while admitting to its franchise, and enrolling among its
                    vocables, an indefinite number of foreign recruits.</p>

                    pointed out) constitute an expansion of the legendary history of Arthur. Layamon
                    was the parish priest of Ernley-on-Severn (now Areley Regis), a remote
                    Worcestershire village, far from the capital or any large city. At such a place
                    Norman influence would be at a minimum; the people would go on from one
                    generation to another, living and speaking much as their fathers did before
                    them; and we may suppose that, finding some indications of literary taste and
                    poetic feeling among members of his flock, the good Layamon took this way of
                    gratifying them. But it must be carefully observed that in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brut,</hi> although the language is English, the poetical atmosphere, the
                    intellectual horizon, and even the cast of diction, are Norman-French. The rich
                    poetic vocabulary of the Anglo-Saxon poets, traceable as late as the reigu of
                    Edgar, has vanished beyond recovery. Not one of the innumerable poetic compounds
                    relating to battle and victory which are found in <hi rend="italic">Beowulf,
                    Andreas,</hi> &amp;c., occurs in the duller pages of the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The labours of the clergy and monks during all this period were applied with
                    unwearying diligence and signal success to the building up of a Latin
                    literature. In the list of chroniclers occur the well-known names of Florence of
                    Worcester, William of Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon. Many histories of
                    particular monasteries were written, and have recently to a large extent been
                    made accessible, through the labours of editors employed under the
                    superintendence of the Master of the Rolls. St Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury
                    in the reigns of William II. and Henry I., employed his great metaphysical and
                    dialectical powers in the endeavour to establish a harmony between reason and
                    faith. The scholastic philosophy, technically speaking, began with Peter Lombard
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Book of Sentences</hi> (1151); from the university of
                    Paris it spread all over Europe; and in the next period it will be seen that
                    several of the most eminent schoolmen were natives of the British Isles. The
                    works of our countrymau, John of Salisbury, who studied and resided much at
                    Paris about the middle of the century, throw a curious light on the tenets and
                    mutual relations of the scholastic sects.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Amalgamation of Paces.—Commencements of English
                    Literature,</hi> 1215-1350.—The course of events in this period, as bearing upon
                    literature, may be thus described. The fortunate loss of Normandy in 1204
                    brought the ruling classes and the commonalty of England closer together, put an
                    end to the transmarine nationality and domicile of the former, and gave a common
                    political interest, in relation to the outside world, to all the dwellers on
                    English soil. Thus two out of the four nations, which we spoke of in the last
                    section as encamped side by side on British territory, were soon in a fair way
                    of being fused into one. The third— the Welsh—losing in 1292 its political
                    independence, lost also with it the pretension, and almost the desire, to
                    maintain a separate literature. Still, however, in spite of common interests,
                    and the ever-growing multiplicity of the ties of blood between the two, Norman
                    and Englishman continued each to speak his own language. Layamon, about 1205,
                    and Ormin, fifteen or twenty years later, write for the English-speaking
                    majority which understands little or no French; from French their language is
                    just as alien as the Flemish of the present day. The first great step towards
                    that blending of tongues which was to crown the blending of families already
                    commenced was taken when the English writers and translators of the 13th century
                    (the terms are almost synonymous), began to admit freely into their writings an
                    unlimited number of those generally intelligible French words of which the stock
                    was, through closer intercourse between the governors and the governed,
                    perpetually on the increase. Of this practice Robert of Gloucester and Robert
                    Manning are conspicuous examples. In spite of this approximation, we shall find
                    that strenuous efforts were made, by or on behalf of the upper classes, to
                    retain French as the common literary language, and keep English in the position
                    of a popular dialect, useful for the common purposes of life, but not vivified
                    by genius or polished by contact with refined lips. Of this effort Robert
                    Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, may be considered the centre. It broke down,
                    however, against the force of circumstances. First, as fast as good French books
                    were produced, Englishmen translated them, and the translations probably found
                    ten readers for one who could enjoy the originals; secondly, the wars between
                    England and France which broke out in 1338, and in which the English-speaking
                    archers—the back-bone of the stout yeomanry, now, alas! no more, which then
                    covered the land—won the chief share of glory, must have greatly tended to
                    discredit among Englishmen of all classes the tongue of their enemies. Trevisa
                    says that the popular rage for speaking French which had existed before the
                    “grete deth” (the plague of 1348), was since then “somdele chaunged.” Though he
                    naturally refers to a date still fresh in every one’s memory, the change could
                    have had nothing to do with the plague; it was probably, as conjectured above,
                    the effect of the French war. By the middle of the 14th century the industry of
                    the translators had produced a great body of English compositions, coloured
                    everywhere by French thought, and studded with French words, the preaching of
                    the friars had for a hundred years been working in the same direction, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to break down the partition not only between the races
                    but between the tongues; the war suddeuly gave to English an enormous advantage
                    over its rival in respect of popularity; it need not therefore surprise us to
                    find, as we shall find in the next period, a great native writer choosing
                    English for the instrument of his thought, and founding English literature upon
                    an imperishable basis.</p>
                <p>In the last section we saw that Latin, the language of the clerical community,
                    was holding its ground vigorously and successfully against the different forms
                    of vernacular speech current in England. While these last remained in a rude and
                    unsettled condition, it was inevitable that Latin should enjoy this superiority.
                    But the French language was ever growing in importance; its grammatical forms
                    were by this time tolerably settled, and its modes of derivation fixed; it was a
                    spoken tongue, and the Latin was not. Hence, about the date of Magna Charta
                    (1215), French begins to appear in our public instruments, Latin having been the
                    documentary language since the Conquest; about 1270 it begins to supersede Latin
                    as the language of private correspondence. Latin thenceforward was less and less
                    used as the language of poetry, the vehicle of satire, or the voice of piety;
                    French took its place. The theologian, the philosopher, and the annalist alone
                    remained faithful to Latin, the third more out of habit perhaps, and because he
                    had inherited the great works of the past, the histories of Beda, Florence,
                    &amp;c., than because his work could not have been competently performed in
                    French. To this period belong the important chronicle of Matthew Paris, who died
                    in 1259, that of Nicholas Trivet, and the <hi rend="italic">Polychronicoη</hi>
                    (or at any rate the earlier portion of it) of Ranulf Higden. Great developments
                    of the scholastic theology were made in this period, chiefly by the new orders
                    of friars founded about its commencement, the children of St Francis and St
                    Dominic. Two of the most celebrated of the Franciscan writers, Duns Scotus and
                    William of Occam, were natives of the British isles; they were respectively the
                    chiefs of the realists and nominalists, the parties representing among the
                    schoolmen Platonic and Aristotelian theories. Robert Holcot, a distinguished
                    Dominican writer and a nominalist, was carried off by the plague of 1348.</p>
                <p>Philosophy now for the first time, in the person of Roger Bacon, devotes herself
                    systematically to the study of nature and its laws. This great man, the chief
                    part of whose long life was spent in the Franciscan friary at Oxford, died in
                    1292. The main plan of his principal work, the <hi rend="italic">Opus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Majus,</hi> was—in the words of Dr Whewell—“to urge the necessity
                    of a reform in the mode of philosophizing, to set forth the reasons why
                    knowledge had not made a greater progress, to draw back attention to sources of
                    knowledge which had been unwisely neglected, to discover other sources which
                    were yet wholly unknown, and to animate men to the undertaking by a prospect of
                    the vast advantages which it offered.” But the subsidiary aids which physical
                    science requires were wanting to him, and in that rude age could only be
                    obtained with extreme difficulty. Mathematical instruments were terribly
                    expensive; tables were scarcely to be hid; books were both <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n429/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0429-0410"/> rare and costly. That he discovered so much as he
                    did— chiefly in chemistry and optics—is a thing to wonder at. Vague reports of
                    these discoveries circulating among the ignorant populace caused Roger Bacon to
                    be deemed a conjuror or necromancer; the chap-books and low comedies of the
                    reign of Elizabeth represent him exclusively in this light.</p>
                <p>-, In the reign of Henry III. a strong effort was made to make French the
                    exclusive literary language of the English people. It was a struggle between the
                    tongue of the upper class and the tongue of the middle class. Robert
                    Grosseteste, the admired and venerated bishop of a great see, was surrounded by
                    ecclesiastics of rank, and in constant intercourse with earls and barons. All
                    such persons would speak French; those that were laymen would stand in great
                    need of spiritual and moral instruction, and this could not well be conveyed to
                    them in any language but their own; it was quite natural, therefore, that the
                    bishop should encourage the writing of French treatises; and it is probable that
                    he sincerely thought the English tongue not to be worth cultivating for the
                    purposes of literature. He may be excused for holding this opinion, if the only
                    specimens of it which he had seen on paper were such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orrnulum,</hi> or even as Layamon’s <hi rend="italic">Brut.</hi> A French work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Manuel de</hi><hi rend="italic">Peche,</hi> treating of
                    the decalogue and the seven deadly sins, which are illustrated with many
                    legendary stories, was formerly ascribed to Grosseteste— it is now known to have
                    been the work of William of Waddington; yet if the statement be true, that it is
                    a version of a little known Latin treatise, there remains a probability that the
                    bishop, in pursuance of a general plan of action, encouraged Waddington to make
                    his version. To the <hi rend="italic">Chastel TAmour,</hi> a work of devotion
                    dwelling on the mode of the miraculous incarnation of the Redeemer,
                    Grosseteste’s claim seems to be better founded; if he did not write it, he
                    certainly caused it to be written. The same despair of making anything of
                    English, or the same connexion with a circle of readers in the upper ranks of
                    society, led Peter Langtoft, a canon of Bridlington, in spite of his
                    unmistakably English name, to write in French a rhyming chronicle of English
                    history, which he brings down to 1307. Other cases might be mentioned; in fact,
                    as Warton says, “anonymous French pieces both in prose and verse, and written
                    about this time, are innumerable in our manuscript repositories.” There were
                    French originals of <hi rend="italic">Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hamtouη,</hi> and
                    many other romances, although few of them are now extant</p>
                <p>But if the attack was vigorous, the defence was sturdy and persistent, with a
                    tenacity which spoke of final victory. Ormin’s rhythmic gospels (supposed to
                    have been written about 1225), though the orthography proceeds upon a theory,
                    and is so far interesting, presents, it must be admitted—owing to the
                    strangeness of the spelling, the want of rhyme, and the paucity of words of
                    Latin origin— a barbarous, almost repulsive, aspect to the reader. The war of
                    the barons in Henry III.’s reign, in which the cause of Leicester and other
                    French-speaking aristocrats was taken up by the mass of the people with
                    unmeasured enthusiasm, certainly had the effect of introducing a number of
                    French words into the popular speech. This may be gathered from the remarkable
                    English ballad on the battle of Lewes (1264), written by a partisan of
                    Leicester, the phraseology of which is marked by almost the same proportion of
                    words of French origin as prevails in modern English. Moreover, the movement of
                    the verse is vigorous and free, and such as befits a language that is fast
                    rising into importance, and has a great destiny before it. In the reign of
                    Edward I. appeared the English rhyming chronicle of Robert of Gloucester. The
                    early portion of it is founded on Wace’s <hi rend="italic">Brut,</hi> but the
                    author continues the history down to 1272, the date of Edward’s accession.
                    Robert is a plodding dull writer, but his work proves that he knew of a
                    considerable class of persons who knew no French, yet were capable of deriving
                    pleasure from literature; it is for this class that his somewhat ponderous poem
                    was intended. The pretty poem describing a contest between an owl and a
                    nightingale (date about 1270) is in the dialect of the south of England. It is
                    no translation, but seems to have been suggested by passages in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Roman de la Rose.</hi> Many English romances, c.y., <hi
                    rend="italic">Havelok, King Horn, King Alexander, Richard I., Guy of
                    Warwick,</hi> &amp;c., date from the reign of Edward L, or, say, from the last
                    twenty years of the 13th century. Most of these are translations from the
                    French; in the case of <hi rend="italic">Havelok,</hi> however, this remains to
                    be proved, no French version (other than the sketch, much earlier in date, given
                    in Gairnar’s <hi rend="italic">Estorie)</hi> being now extant. There is a French
                    version of <hi rend="italic">King Horn,</hi> but it differs greatly from the
                    English romance, and there is good reason for believing that the English poem is
                    the earlier of the two. Both <hi rend="italic">Havelok</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">King Horn</hi> are founded on Anglo-Danish traditione current in
                    the east of England; on this account, and in consideration of the long
                    intellectual blight which the Danish inroads produced in those parts of the
                    country, they are extremely interesting and valuable. They abound in French
                    words, and on reading them we feel that a language which has become so fluent,
                    flexible, and accommodating cannot but make its way and attain to
                    predominance.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the works of no single writer contributed so much to this result as those
                    of Robert Manning, or, as he is also called, Robert of Brunne. Robert was a monk
                    of the order founded by St Gilbert of Sempringham; his monastery was in South
                    Lincolnshire. He belongs to the reigns of Edward II. and Edward III.; the date
                    of his death is unknown; but it was probably about 1340. He executed a new
                    version of Wace’s <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi> in octosyllabic rhyming verse, and
                    added to it a translation of the French rhyming chronicle of Peter Langtoft,
                    mentioned in a previous paragraph. He also translated Waddington’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Manuel</hi><hi rend="italic">des Peches,</hi> adding many
                    characteristic and lively passages which make his version much more entertaining
                    than the original work. To all these labours the good monk was impelled, not by
                    the love of fame, which would have been more easily gratified if he had written
                    in French, but by the benevolent desire to give his lay friends and
                    acquaintances something pleasant to read and talk about,— “For to haf solace and
                    gamen,</p>
                <p>In felauschip when tha sit samen [together].”</p>
                <p>We have found that by degrees men of better, or at least equal, mark have taken
                    to writing in English, as compared with those who preferred French; for
                    instance, Robert Manning is at least equal as a versifier to Peter Langtoft. In
                    the next section will be described the rise of Chaucer, Langlaud, and Gower, and
                    the final victory of the native speech.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Early English Literature,</hi> 1350-1477 —The period at
                    which we have arrived comprises about 120 years, ending at the date of the
                    introduction of printing into England. During all this time the scholastic
                    philosophy reigned undisturbed at the universities. Wickliffe, so far as his
                    methods of argument and reliance on logic were concerned, was as much a
                    schoolman as the friars who contended with him. The time was not yet come when a
                    churchman would be found, like Colet, to decry the scholastic methods, and rely
                    on literature rather than on logic. Wickliffe’s first attacks upon the
                    established order were directed, not against doctrine, but against the
                    encroachments of the church upon the state, against the holding of temporal
                    “lordship” or authority by ecclesiastical persons, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n430/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0430-0411"/> against the claim asserted by the Pope to receive
                    “Peter’s pence,” or an equivalent, from the English nation. These views he was
                    said to have borrowed from Marsilius of Padua and John of Gaudun; but in truth
                    such Ghibeline sentiments were so common in France and Germany, as well as
                    Italy, that it is needless, in Wickliffe’s case, to attempt to trace them to
                    particular authors. Afterwards he broached some singular opinions on several
                    abstruse points of metaphysics, which led to “determinations” or treatises being
                    published against him by John Kyningham, a Carmelite, and John Tyssington, a
                    Franciscan. Lastly, he aroused a theological storm, about 1380, by reviving
                    something like the condemned heresy of Berengarius on the mode of the presence
                    of Christ in the sacrament. Replies were written by Wynterton, Wells, Berton,
                    and others. A synod met in London and condemned Wickliffe’s doctrine; he died at
                    Lutterworth soon afterwards. The whole complex controversy which he had stirred
                    up was taken in hand, some years later, by a man of vast ability and learning,
                    Thomas Walden the Carmelite, one of the English theologians who took part in the
                    council of Constance. Walden’s <hi rend="italic">Doctrinale Fidei</hi> has been
                    more than once printed on the Continent.</p>
                <p>All the writings hitherto described were in Latin. But Wickliffe, on the
                    principle “Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo,” resolved to carry the
                    conflict into a more spacious arena, and to appeal to popular sympathy by
                    writing in the language of the people. He preached and circulated many English
                    sermons; he organized his “pore priestes” as a body of itinerant preachers;
                    assisted by his followers he put into circulation an incredible number of
                    English tracts, directed against abuses in discipline, and what he deemed errors
                    in doctrine. Lastly, he caused to be made a complete English translation of the
                    Vulgate Bible, and himself, in all probability, took a considerable share in the
                    work. His efforts, seconded by those of his principal adherents, such as
                    Herford, Repington, Purvey, Ac., gave rise to the sect of the Lollards, which
                    must have rapidly grown into importance, since it received marked notice in the
                    poetry (written probably between 1380 and 1390), of both Chaucer and Gower. The
                    famous Act “De heretico comburendo” of 1401, and the rigid inquisitorial
                    measures instituted by Archbishop Arundel, and carried on by Chichely, drove
                    Lollardism beneath the surface of society and from the pages of avowed
                    literature. Yet, though repressed, the spirit of discontent survived. Many
                    Lollards were burnt so late as in the first year of Henry VIIT.; and the rain of
                    pamphlets and ballads against the church and the clergy, which burst forth as
                    soon as the king was ascertained to be hostile to them, was a sufficient
                    indication of the pent-up hatred which filled the breasts of thousands.</p>
                <p>The career of Pecock, bishop of Chichester, may be regarded as an incident of
                    Lollardism. Feeling sore and uneasy under the attacks which men, many of whom
                    were undeniably earnest and moral, were making on the clergy and their doings,
                    Pecock wrote in English <hi rend="italic">The Repressor of over-much
                    wytinge</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">blamiηg^</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Clcrgie.</hi> He thought that the
                    time for appealing to authority was gone by, and that the Lollards could only be
                    reconciled to the church by proving that her precepts and her ritual were in
                    themselves reasonable. In short·, he made the reason of the individual the judge
                    of the goodness, or otherwise, of what the church did and commanded. On this
                    ground his brother bishops could not follow him; his books were condemned at a
                    synod held in 1457, and he was deposed from his bishopric.</p>
                <p>English literature in the full and proper sense, of which we saw the beginnings
                    in the cumbrous alexandrines of Robert of Gloucester, and the more pleasing and
                    successful writings of Manning, asserts itself in this period as a growth of
                    time, destined to have thenceforward an independent being and a powerful
                    influence. It is interesting to note that two distinct and rival tendencies now
                    make their appearance, which may be described as the Teutonic affinity and the
                    Franco-Latin affinity. The sturdiness and self-reliance of the old Saxon blood
                    led many Englishmen to undervalue the culture of the day, which came from the
                    South, and to look lovingly towards the old Teutonic rock from which they were
                    hewn, in the faith that true light and deliverance were to be found there. Of
                    this tendency Langland is the chief representative in the 14th century. He
                    employs the old rhythm of the Teutonic nations,— alliteration; he rejects French
                    models, and studies not French poets; the homely kindly life of the English
                    lower and lower-middle classes is what he loves to depict; the covetousness and
                    ambition of the foreign ecclesiastics who absorb English prelacies he is never
                    tired of denouncing. The whole body of alliterating poets,—and recent
                    investigation has shown that their number was considerable even down to the 16th
                    century, the last known alliterative piece is by Dunbar,—represent, with
                    Langland, this Teutonic affinity. Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, and the writers who
                    formed themselves upon them, represent the Franco-Latin affinity. Endowed with a
                    more receptive temper and finer perceptions than the men of the opposite school,
                    Chaucer opened his large heart and capacious intelligence to all forms of
                    excellence within his reach; and a man so minded could not fail to see that what
                    had been written in French and Italian far outweighed what had hitherto been
                    written in English or German. Neither could his more cultivated ear fail to
                    prefer the rhyme of the South to the alliteration of the North. “I am a Southron
                    man,” he says under the mask of the Persone—</p>
                <p>“I cannot geste, <hi rend="italic">rom,</hi><hi rend="italic">ram,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ruf,</hi> by my letter;”</p>
                <p>that is, I cannot write alliterative poems like Langland. Wherever good words
                    were to be had, Chaucer appropriated them, whether their origin were Saxon or
                    Romance; wherever he found a good poem, he imitated it, often bettering the
                    instruction. This veracity of the intellect, this large-mi ndedness, were the
                    cause that our early literature was laid on broad foundations, and contributed
                    not a little to the many-sided and <hi rend="italic">sympathetic</hi> character
                    of our language.</p>
                <p>The labours of Tyrwhitt and Warton, and in our own day of Sandras and Ten-Brink,
                    have laid bare the sources whence the genius of Chaucer drew its materials and
                    derived its kindling suggestions. The old notion that his earliest writings show
                    the influence of the Provençal poetry has been abandoned on more accurate
                    inquiry. The <hi rend="italic">Complaynt of the Dethe of Rite,</hi> which is
                    among the earliest, if not the earliest, of the extant compositions, is
                    saturated with the French spirit. The great work of his early youth was the
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la Rose</hi> of Lorris and
                    Meung,—a poem, be it remembered, not the growth of Normandy, but of France
                    proper, not the work of trouvères, but of French poets. This transformation and
                    sublimation of the <hi rend="italic">romance</hi> of the earlier into the <hi
                    rend="italic">dream</hi> and <hi rend="italic">allegory</hi> of the later Middle
                    Ages, originated by the genius of Lorris, was eagerly adopted by Chaucer, most
                    of whose pieces, prior to the great work of his life, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canterbury Tales,</hi> were cast in the allegorical mould. This is the case
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Assembly of</hi><hi rend="italic">Foules,</hi> where
                    the gentle “formel eagle” is believed to represent Isabel, daughter of Edward
                    III., betrothed in 1364 to Engelram de Couci, as the formel is in the poem to
                    the “royal tercel.” Again the <hi rend="italic">Poke of the Duchesse,</hi> on
                    the death of Blanche, duchess of Lancaster, in 1369, is, in form, a vision seen
                    in a dream; it is also full of actual borrowings from the French poets Lorris,
                    Meung, and Machault. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n431/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0431-0412"/> mannerism of the French poets is also present in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Court of Love</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">House of
                    Fame,</hi> compositions which probably belong to Chaucer’s middle life. Even in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Legende</hi><hi rend="italic">of Goode Women,</hi> a work
                    of his later years, many passages, particularly the beautiful lines rehearsing
                    his annual worship of the daisy, are significant of the degree in which his mind
                    was still imbued with the graceful and fanciful conceptions of the French
                    poets.</p>
                <p>But the sunny south produced in that age other poets beside the French, poets the
                    force and melody of whose writings caused the glory of Lorris and Machault to
                    wax pale in comparison. Chaucer must have become acquainted with Boccaccio at an
                    early age, for in the <hi rend="italic">Assembly of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Foules,</hi> written when he was only twenty-four or twenty-five, several
                    stanzas are translated from the description, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theseide</hi> of the Italian poet, of the garden of Queen Nature. With Petrarch
                    he is believed on reasonable grounds to have become acquainted during his visit
                    to Italy in 1373; the charming allusion to the “lauréat poete,” in the prologue
                    to the “Clerke’s Tale,” is familiar to every reader. Dante, whom he calls “the
                    grete poete of Itaille,” supplied him with a vision in the “House of Fame,” and
                    with the materials of one of the tragedies in the “Monke’s Tale,” the story of
                    Count Ugolino. But it was to Boccaccio that his obligations were the largest;
                    from his 7 ’ 77o∙√rαfo he translated, though, with many additions and
                    alterations, his <hi rend="italic">Troylus and Cryseyde;</hi> the “Knighte’s
                    Tale” is in the main a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Theseide,</hi> and
                    two or three other <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> are more or less
                    close renderings of stories in the <hi rend="italic">Decameron.</hi> Italian was
                    then in a far more advanced stage, one better suited for literary purposes, than
                    English; and it must be set down as undoubtedly due to his Italian studies that
                    in Chaucer’s hands our language,—which seventy years before had appeared as a
                    barbarous dialect in the mouth of Robert of Gloucester, and, even as used by
                    Langland, Chaucer's contemporary, is harsh and crabbed,— was proved to be rich
                    in sweetness and harmony, no less than in force.</p>
                <p>After all, had Chaucer done no more than has been already indicated, though he
                    would have deserved credit for polishing and regularizing the language, and
                    would have left models of style for later ages to imitate, he would not have
                    earned the praise of a great and immortal poet. In this category, however, he is
                    definitively placed, in virtue of the original portions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canterbury Tales.</hi> Not only is the Prologue the work of a great literary
                    artist, drawing from nature with an incomparable force, sureness, and freedom of
                    hand, but the whole series of linking passages, besides many of the tales,
                    which, though the materials are old, are transfigured by the treatment they
                    receive, attest the presence of a masterly intellect and an unfailing
                    imagination. He “saw life thoroughly and saw it whole;” his somewhat keen and
                    caustic temper opened his eyes to the tricks of hypocrites and pretenders, which
                    his manly straightforwardness made him expose without ceremony; on the other
                    hand, the noble and really superior cast of his character placed him in full
                    sympathy with those who in heroic self-denial were following under his eyes the
                    counsels of perfection. Over against the portraits of Monk, Friar, and Pardoner
                    in the Prologue, may be set the legend of Sainte Cecile, the “Alan of Lawe’s
                    Tale,” and the exquisite opening stanzas of the “Prioress’s Tale.” In that
                    peculiar combination of great force of handling with grace and versatility, on
                    which the availability and effect of poetic genius so largely depend, Chaucer
                    may be placed in a trio with Shakespeare and Pope, and no fourth name in English
                    literature can, from this point of view, he raised to their level.</p>
                <p>Coming to speak of Gower after Chaucer, we descend, as we now clearly see,
                    through an enormous interval; but this distance was not so apparent to their
                    contemporaries and immediate successors. “Ancient Gower” was a favourite with
                    Richard IL, and was also prudent enough to pay his court betimes to the young
                    Duke of Lancaster, soon to be Henry IV. His <hi rend="italic">Confessio
                    Amantis</hi> is coloured by all the profanity and much of the cynicism which
                    belong to Jean de Meung’s portion of the <hi rend="italic">Roman de la.
                    Rose.</hi> It may be observed, in passing, that the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi>
                    was the product of a kind of minor renaissance, or revival of ancient learning.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi> of Macrobius gave the dream-form,
                    and Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Ars Amandi</hi> supplied an abundant store of
                    amatory details. From this last, and from others of his poems, the counsels and
                    warnings to lovers, with which the <hi rend="italic">Roman,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessio Amantis,</hi> and many another popular poem of that day
                    was stocked, were, partly by suggestion, partly by direct translation, derived.
                    That the <hi rend="italic">Ars Amandi</hi> should come to spread so wide an
                    influence was a fact of no good omen to the morals of Europe. Refinement, even
                    when little more than external, seems to exercise an invincible attraction on
                    the human mind. The wit and suppleness of the Greek intellect, the polished
                    luxury of the Roman empire, dazzled more and more the semi-cultivated society of
                    Europe, and created a paganizing fashion, of which the moral results were often
                    deplorable. Numbers even of ecclesiastics were carried away; bishops prided
                    themselves on their elegant <hi rend="italic">symposia;</hi> abbots, “purple as
                    their wines,” thumbed Anacreon instead of their breviaries; and in spite of
                    Savonarola and other reformers from within, no effectual check appeared for
                    these evils till it was supplied by the rude blasts of the Reformation.</p>
                <p>Dan Lydgate, the monk of Bury, was a loyal admirer and follower of Chaucer; and
                    if the practice of poetry could make a perfect poet, he should stand, in virtue
                    of his innumerable compositions, among those of the highest rank. But the
                    language,—already rich and various, but unsettled in form and deficient in
                    precedents,—escaped out of his control; to bend and tame it effectually while in
                    such a condition required the strength of an intellectual giant, such as Chaucer
                    was, but Lydgate certainly was not. We know that Chaucer took the greatest pains
                    with his metre—</p>
                <p>“So praye I to God, that none miswrite thee, Ne thee mysmetre for defaut of tonge
                    but Lydgate, though, to recommend his mediocre thoughts, he should have taken
                    much greater pains, took in fact much less. Perhaps some crude theory of poetic
                    inspiration misled him, as it misleads poets of our own day, whose roughness and
                    obscurity yield as unsatisfactory results as Lydgate’s roughness and mediocrity.
                    The materials for his more important productions were chiefly French and Latin
                    works of his own day, or not much earlier in date. Thus his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Falls of Princes</hi> is from a French metrical version of Boccaccio’s Latin
                    prose work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Casibus Illustrium
                    Virorum,</hi> and his Troy-book is founded on the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Trojana</hi> of Guido di Colonna, a Sicilian jurist of the 13th century.
                    Lydgate’s admiration for Chaucer was undoubtedly sincere, and he probably
                    attempted to imitate the best points of Chaucer’s style. If yet to a great
                    extent he failed, this was perhaps due, not merely to the carelessness to which
                    we have before adverted, but also to the influence of the barbarous writers of
                    alliterative verse, whose activity at this period we described in the early part
                    of this section. Alliterative rhythm is accentual, heroic rhythm is syllabic. An
                    alliterative verse may have a varying number of syllables, but must have four
                    accents; an heroic verse may have a varying number of accents, but must contain
                    ten, or at most eleven, syllables. Of course the variation in either case is
                    confined within certain limits, and the rules themselves are not without
                    exceptions; <pb break="no"

                    enter. Suffice it to say, that the reason why there is so much halting metre in
                    Lydgate, Hawes, Barclay, Harding, Juliana Berners, and other versifiers of the
                    15th and 16th centuries, would seem to be that, unlike Chaucer, they indulged in
                    much of the syllabic licence of the alliterators, while yet they were not goths
                    enough to adopt their rhythm altogether. Between the Teutonic and Franco-Latin
                    stools, so to speak, they fell to the ground.</p>
                <p>A recent writer, to whose labours the history of English literature is much
                    indebted,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. H.
                    Morley.</p></note> desiring to mark picturesquely the appearance of an art which
                    he thought was destined to give the death-blow to medi⅛val superstition, has
                    said that “in the year of the condemnation of Reginald Pecock for declaring that
                    all truth would bear the test of reason and inquiry, John Fust or Faust and
                    Peter Schoeffer printed a magnificent edition of the Psalter.” This shows how
                    easily an attractive antithesis may become a trap for the unwary. The statement
                    made in the protasis of the above sentence is untrue, and that in the apodosis
                    irrelevant. Pecock was not condemned for “declaring that all truth would bear
                    the test of reason and inquiry” (which of course his opponents believed as well
                    as he), but for maintaining, along with other novel opinions, that reason was a
                    better guide than authority as to the matter of revealed religion. Doubtless
                    many would agree with him, but this is a very different proposition from the
                    other. Nor again was the appearance of Fust’s Psalter an epoch in the history of
                    printing, as the coincidence of dates, to be worth noticing, would require, for
                    it was both preceded and followed by the production of more important works.</p>
                <p>Yet it would not be easy to overrate the effect produced by the invention of
                    printing on the development of literature, and the diffusion of those complex
                    influences and arrangements which we call civilization. Language and its
                    devices, as Horne Tooke showed in his <hi rend="italic">Diversions of
                    Parley,</hi> exist but to promote the rapid interchange of ideas between man and
                    man; and the device of printing is a further long step in the same march, and a
                    part of the same endeavour. By means of it, books reached in five years
                    countries which before they had not reached in twenty, and readers were
                    multiplied a hundred fold. Through it the speculations of scholars and the
                    theories of philosophers could be quickly brought before the whole body of
                    learned men and philosophers in Europe , hence arose counter speculations and
                    adverse theories, which again obtained publicity with the same rapidity as the
                    first, and to this process there was no limit. · Poetry, as being one of the
                    more spontaneous growths of the human mind,— the child of passion and
                    imagination, not of controversy,— owed comparatively little to the new
                    invention. The literary annals of Spain furnish us with the names of more than a
                    hundred poets who adorned the long reign of John II. of Castile, ere printing
                    came into being; while for a century after the discovery, the poetic art was in
                    a feeble and inert condition, both in Spain and England. On the other hand,
                    historical studies of all kinds, since they flourish in proportion to the
                    facilities given of collecting facts and materials,—and printing greatly
                    enhanced these facilities,—received a sudden and highly beneficial impulse.</p>
                <p>The first book certainly known to have been printed in England is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictes</hi><hi rend="italic">and Sayings</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophers,</hi> a translation from the French; this
                    was printed by Caxton in 1477, within the precints of the abbey of Westminster.
                    The monks of St Alban’s soon set up a printing-press in their great monastery;
                    and Oxford and Cambridge quickly followed suit. For fifteen years more Caxton
                    laboured diligently in his vocation, and at his death in 1492 left the art of
                    printing firmly established in England. An examination of the list of works
                    which he printed shows what branches of literature were most in esteem in the
                    English society of his day. Professor Craik enumerates forty-five works, which
                    comprise all Caxton’s more important typographical performances. Of these,
                    thirteen are religious and devotional, twelve are works of romance and chivalry
                    or other prose fiction, seven are historical or legal works, five are English
                    versions of classical authors, five handbooks or didactic works, and three
                    editions of English poets. To the first class belong the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Golden Legend</hi> (a translation of the collection of lives of saints under
                    that name compiled by Jacobus de Voragine), a <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Festivalis,</hi> or guide to church festivals, a <hi rend="italic">L,ife of
                    Saint Wynefrid,</hi> and several pious books translated from the French. Under
                    the second head fall Malory’s English version of the great French prose romances
                    of Arthur, the <hi rend="italic">Ryal Book,</hi> a “Troybook” translated from
                    the French of Raoul Le Fevre, the <hi rend="italic">Book of Feats of Arms,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Historye of Reynard the Foxe,</hi> translated from the
                    Flemish. To the historical section belong Trevisa’s version of Higden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Polychronicon,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Chronicles of
                    England</hi> by Fabyan, and the statutes passed in the first year of Richard
                    III. Among the classics offered to the English public were versions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> and of Cicero <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Senectute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De Am icitia,</hi> translated
                    from French versions, and Chaucer’s rendering of Boethius’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione Philosophice.</hi> The handbooks contain

                    Travellers,</hi> &amp;c. The English poets, editions of parts of whose works
                    were printed by Caxton, were, as was to be expected, Chaucer, Gower, and
                    Lydgate.</p>
                <p>In the period ending with 1350, we saw that the plant of English literature,
                    though putting out some vigorous offshoots, in the poems of Nicolas of Guildford
                    and Robert Manning, was still struggling with great linguistic difficulties, so
                    that it remained uncertain whether, like Flemish literature in Belgium, it would
                    not have to content itself with appealing to the humbler classes of the people,
                    and leave to France the office of ministering to the intellectual and
                    imaginative wants of all cultivated persons. In 1470 this doubt remained no
                    more; the question had bcen finally settled in favour of native genius. England
                    had now a literature in her own speech of which she might be proud,—authors
                    whose manner and phraseology supplied models to allied but less advanced
                    nationalities. James I. of Scotland, who was killed in 1436, speaks in the <hi
                    rend="italic">King's Quhair</hi> of the trio of English poets in terms of
                    reverence comparable to those which Chaucer himself, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troylus and Cryseyde,</hi> had used of the great poets of antiquity. But this
                    success had only been gained by the wise exercise of that talent for compromise
                    which we English, even to this day, are said to possess almost to a fault.
                    English literature was to employ a language which in its structure and grammar
                    indeed was Teutonic, but was to admit without scruple into its vocabulary
                    thousands of French words which the upper classes, the descendants of the Norman
                    invaders, were in the habit of using. It seemed as if both language and people
                    were destined to hold a position midway between the European nations of Teutonic
                    and those of Latin origin, to be interpreters between the one and the other, and
                    thus to facilitate, for the numerous communities which in due time the English
                    race was to plant over the world, the comprehension of the thoughts and the
                    appreciation of the ideals of both.</p>

                    section. A new interest seized upon all the more lively intelligences, —that of
                    recovering what, having passed into oblivion, might still be recoverable of the
                    works of the ancients, as well as of appropriating thoroughly what was already
                    known. In Latin literature the chief works had long been known; Virgil, Ovid,
                    and even many of the works of Cicero, had for ages been the delight of scholars
                    and the food of poets. But even in respect of these, the greater <hi
                    rend="italic">publicity</hi> which the multiplication of copies by the
                    printingpress gave to them led to innumerable questions being stirred, which
                    till then had lain comparatively dormant. The problems of textual, philological,
                    and literary criticism, which the careful study of an author suggested to an
                    acute mind, were taken up with eagerness by a large and ever-increasing circle
                    of students. But it was Greek learning, because of the comparative newness of
                    the field, and the inconceivable value of the treasures which it hid, that
                    awakened the most intense and passionate interest. The story of the revival of
                    Greek studies in Italy, towards the end of the 14th century, is as exciting to a
                    sensitive intellect asany romance. Gradually the contagion of the learned frenzy
                    which created a hundred academies and literary societies in the Italian cities
                    spread itself across the Alps. England was but a very little, if at all, behind
                    France. The steps by which a change of so much importance to literature was
                    effected seem to be worth tracing with some minuteness. Without lingering over
                    the names of Ciray, Phrea, and Vitelli, by each of whom something was done
                    towards promoting Greek study at Oxford, we will begin with Linacre’s master,
                    William Selling. An Oxonian, and a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury, Selling
                    conceived a fervent desire to partake of the intellectual banquet provided in
                    the schools of Florence, where the great Lorenzo was then ruling the republic;
                    and about the year in which Sir Thomas More was born (1480) he travelled into
                    Italy, and attended for some time the lectures of that prodigy of learning and
                    talent, Angelo Politiano. While in Italy he learnt to read and speak Greek, and
                    collected a number of Greek MSS.; but unluckily, soon after his return with
                    these to England, they were destroyed by an accidental fire. Thomas Linacre, a
                    Derbyshire boy, had Selling for his master at the Canterbury school; his
                    capacity and zeal for study were great, and when Selling was sent on a mission
                    into Italy by Henry VII. in 1486 or 1487, he took Linacre with him, and left him
                    studying Greek under Politiano at Bologna. In these studies William Grocyn, an
                    older man than Linacre, is mentioned by contemporaries as his “sodalis.” Having
                    been for many years a fellow of New College, he visited Italy between 1480 and
                    1490, and studied chiefly at Florence, under Demetrius Chaicondyles and
                    Politiano. “Grocyn,” says George Lilye, “was the first who publicly lectured on
                    Greek literature at the university of Oxford, to crowded audiences of young
                    men.” Grocyn was a somewhat hard, dry man; an Aristotelian, not a Platonist.
                    Plato he regarded as a man who multiplied words, but in Aristotle he saw the
                    founder of real science. His lectures seem to have been delivered between 1491
                    and 1500. Grocyn left no works behind him; but Linacre, who probably began to
                    lecture in Greek when Grocyn ceased to do so, was a voluminous author and
                    editor. To him we owe editions of the principal works of some of the Greek
                    medical writers, and a Latin grammar, which was superseded in a few years by the
                    more symmetrical <hi rend="italic">Breviarium</hi> of William Lilye, commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">Lilly s Grammar.</hi> An anecdote related of Linacre
                    illustrates the enthusiasm for letters, mingled with a dash of pedantic
                    absurdity, which characterized the age. When about to leave Italy and return to
                    his native country, he erected at Padua an altar, which he dedicated to the
                    genius of Italy; he crowned it with flowers, and burned iucense upon it. More,
                    born in 1480, learnt Greek under Linacre at Oxford, in about the years 1496 and
                    1497. His <hi rend="italic">Progymnasmata</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epigrams</hi> (the latter written conjointly with William Lilye) are the work
                    of a man deeply imbued and inflamed with the classical spirit. The celebrated
                    Dean Colet, whose eminent services to literature and education have been of late
                    years examined and recorded by Seebohm, Lupton, and others, studied Greek in
                    Italy a few years later than Grocyn and Linacre. He lectured at Oxford after
                    1497 on the epistles of St Paul (in Greek), and at St Paul’s, London, of which
                    he was dean, on the <hi rend="italic">Hierarchies</hi> of Dionysius, The letters
                    of Erasmus present in the clearest light the “perfervidum ingenium” of this
                    remarkable man, who, as the founder of St Paul’s school, may be said still to
                    live and work among us. This school he opened in 1510, appointing William Lilye
                    its first headmaster. Lilye himself was no common man. In youth he had travelled
                    to the Holy Land, and on his return took up his abode at Rhodes, and made
                    himself master of the Greek language. Polydore Vergil even says that Lilye was
                    the first Englishman who ever taught publicly “perfectas literas,” by which he
                    appears to mean the Greek authors, but this is certainly a mistake. For the
                    scholars of St Paul's school, Richard Pace, another Oxford man, wrote, at
                    Colet’s request, a pleasant discursive treatise called <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Doctrina percipitur</hi> (1518), in which are introduced some
                    interesting details respecting the learned men of that day. William Latimer, a
                    priest and an Oxford man, is continually mentioned in the letters of Erasmus and
                    his contemporaries as a scholar of vast erudition and especially conversant with
                    Greek. But he was diffident, and perhaps indolent, and declined the task of
                    teaching Fisher Greek, which Erasmus urged him to undertake.</p>
                <p>It is a lamentable fact that after this brilliant opening of the study of the
                    humanities at Oxford, the dawn was overcast, and a dismal reaction set in.
                    Erasmus tells us that, about 1518, a body of brutal obscurantists appeared in
                    the university, who, calling themselves Trojans, attempted by ridicule and petty
                    persecution to discourage the study of Greek. It was on this occasion that More
                    wrote his <hi rend="italic">Epistle to the University</hi> (1519), complaining
                    that the party of the barbarians was not put down. The king was induced to
                    interfere, and the nuisance was after a while suppressed. At Cambridge, though
                    the study of Greek appears to have been introduced later than at Oxford, it was
                    carried on without check or discouragement, and was supported by endowments at
                    an earlier period than at the sister university. The excellent Fisher, bishop of
                    Rochester, who was chancellor of the university of Cambridge from 1501 to 1517,
                    and in that time founded, or helped to found, the colleges of Christ’s and St
                    John’s, promoted Greek learning with all his energy. He invited Erasmus down to
                    Cambridge in 1511, and procured for him, first, the Lady Margaret professorship
                    of divinity, and afterwards the chair of Greek. He was succeeded by a scholar of
                    some celebrity, Richard Croke, who, after being educated for twelve years at
                    foreign universities, at the expense of Archbishop Warham, returned a most
                    accomplished Grecian, and settled at Cambridge. The archbishop just named, the
                    last before the change of religion, was a prelate of great enlightenment and
                    unfailing generosity. Erasmus, who received from him an annual pension and
                    frequent gifts, is never weary of extolling to his correspondents the
                    “sanctissimi mores,” the love of letters, integrity, and piety of the English
                    primate. Towards the middle of the century Sir John Cheke, as Milton says,
                    “taught Cambridge and King Edward Greek;” his friend Sir Thomas Smith was also a
                    great promoter of learning.</p>

                    of Henry VIH. exercised a baneful effect on the progress of learning. Instead of
                    conferring together about the Greek particles, Oxford men were obliged to
                    consider what they should think and say about the king’s divorce. The fate of
                    More, the finest scholar at Oxford, and a writer of European reputation, of whom
                    Charles V. said to the English ambassador, “We would rather have lost the best
                    city of our dominions than such a worthy councillor,” dispirited and alarmed all
                    English men of letters. In such dangerous times wariness, quietness,
                    unobtrusiveness, must have seemed to be the one way of safety. When the tyrant
                    died, men breathed indeed more freely; but the rapacity and indifference to
                    letters of Protector Somerset’s government must have filled all university men
                    with the feeling that the tenure of their endowments was anything but secure,
                    and such a state of mind is not good for the pursuits of learning. Under Mary
                    there was some revival of literary activity; a collection was mode and published
                    of the English works of Sir Thomas More; and new editions of Gower and Lydgate
                    were printed. Warton truly observes, that “when we turn our eyes from [this
                    reign’s] political evils to the objects which its literary history presents, a
                    fair and flourishing scene appears.” On the other hand, the compulsory revival
                    of the scholastic philosophy at the universities, which involved, as we are
                    told, the depreciation of the new learning, was an unpleasant feature of the
                    times. There is a well-known passage in Ascham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schoolmaster,</hi> where, speaking of Cambridge in Mary’s time, he says, that
                    “the love of good learning began suddenly to wax cold, the knowledge of the
                    tongues was manifestly contemned; the truth being,” he goes on to say, “that
                    plans were laid by the university authorities to bring back the works of Duns
                    Scotus, and all the rabble of barbarous questionists,” into the academical
                    course, in the place of Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, and Demosthenes. To throw
                    contempt on the schoolmen,— though it was not confined to the Protestants, for
                    More, Erasmus, Colet, Pace, and many other Catholics had expressed more or less
                    of a similar aversion,—yet was characteristic of them, for their theologians
                    without exception rejected the <hi rend="italic">Schola.</hi> Therefore Gardiner
                    and Bonner appear to have resolved to force scholasticism on the young men of
                    their day, simply because they did not like it.</p>
                <p>Yet at Oxford things cannot have been so bad, for it was in this reign that
                    Trinity College was founded by Sir Thomas Pope, a zealous Catholic, “in the
                    constitution of which the founder principally inculcates the use and necessity
                    of classical literature, and recommends it as the most important and leading
                    object in that system of academical study, which he prescribes to the youth of
                    the new society. For, besides a lecturer in philosophy appointed for the
                    ordinary purpose of teaching the scholastic sciences, he establishes in this
                    seminary a teacher of humanity.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wartou.</p></note> The accession of Elizabeth brought
                    another change. The schoolmen were again ejected, and with contumely, from
                    English seats of learning. By a singular irony of fate, the name of the owner of
                    one of the brightest and most penetrating intellects ever given to man, Duns
                    Scotus, came to be used, in Englaud, as a synonym for a blockhead. Polite
                    literature was now so exclusively cultivated that it destroyed philosophy. The
                    old systems were discredited, but no new system was adopted in their place. Nor
                    has philosophical speculation ever recovered iu England that high place in the
                    hierarchy of the sciences which is its due. In the first twenty years of the
                    reign of Elizabeth though exact scholarship did not flourish much, there was a
                    great and very beneficial activity in the work of making translations from the
                    classics. The names of Golding, North, Phaier, Marlowe, and Stanihurst indicate
                    the authors of the chief of these. Fairfax and Harringtou translated the
                    master-pieces of Tasso and Ariosto. But for the ample store of fresh materials
                    thus supplied, the genius of Shakespeare, who had not a university education,
                    must have displayed itself under comparatively restricted forms.</p>
                <p>Little need be said of those inferior descriptions of poetry which this peιiod
                    produced. Stephen Hawes, in his <hi rend="italic">Pastime of Pleasure,</hi>
                    endeavoured, but with very imperfect success, to effect that blending of
                    allegory with romance which was to be the brilliant achievement of Spenser. The
                    mind of Alexander Barclay seems to have been swayed by that Teutonic affinity of
                    which we spoke in a former section; he turned to Sebastian Brandt rather than to
                    Petrarch, and preferred the grotesque humour of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Narrenschiffe</hi> to the sonnets on Zawra. In Skelton, almost the only poet of
                    the first twenty years of Henry VIII.’s reign, the coarser fibres of the English
                    nature are offensively prominent. His fondness for alliteration, and
                    indifference to the syllabic regularity of his verse, show that he too belonged
                    to the Teutonizing party among the English writers, and that he may be
                    affiliated to Langland and the other alliterators of an earlier age. He
                    occasionally wrote some pretty little lyrics,—witness {he musical lines <hi
                    rend="italic">To Maistress Margary Wentworth,—</hi> but buffoonery and a coarse
                    kind of satire were what his nature prompted him to, and in these he excelled.
                    His attacks on Wolsey’s pride, luxury, and sensuality are well known, nor can it
                    be said that they were not deserved; still, as proceeding from an incontinent
                    priest, they remind us unpleasantly of “Satan reproving sin.” The macaronic
                    verse in which this poet delighted, a farrago of Latin words, classical and
                    barbarous, French words, cant expressions, and English terms clipped or
                    lengthened at pleasure, was called by our ancestors, for many years after his
                    death, “Skeltonical;” but Warton has shown that he did not invent it, but that
                    it was in common use in his time both in Italy and in France. The end of the
                    reign of Henry VIII. was illustrated by the poetry of Surrey and Wyatt. These
                    two writers, having resided long in Italy, and learnt, like Chaucer, justly to
                    appreciate the greatness of Italian literature, which none of their countrymen
                    since Chaucer seemed able to do, “greatly polished,” as Puttenham says, “our
                    rude and homely manner of vulgar poesie from that it had been before, and for
                    that cause may justly be sayd the first reformers of our English metre and
                    style.” To Chaucer’s heroic verse Surrey restored the syllabic regularity which
                    it had lost in inferior hands, and stripping it of rhyme, he for the first time
                    produced English blank verse. Into this rhythm he translated part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid.</hi> He shares with Wyatt the credit of having naturalized
                    the <hi rend="italic">sonnet</hi> in English literature.</p>
                <p>In Scotland there arose in this period several poets of considerable mark, all of
                    whom, in respect of their turn of thought and the best features of their style,
                    may be properly affiliated to Chaucer. Heuryson wrote in “rhyme royal
                    ”—Chaucer’s favourite metre—the <hi rend="italic">Testament of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Faire</hi><hi rend="italic">Creseyde,</hi> a sort of supplement to
                    Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Troylus and Cryseyde.</hi> Iu the poetical remains
                    of Gawain Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, there is much melody and sweetness. In the
                    poems of Dunbar the influence of Chaucer is especially noticeable. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Thistle and the Pose</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Golden</hi><hi rend="italic">Terge</hi> are poems of the same class as the <hi

                    and vision, are employed in both. Sir David Lyndsay began by being a great
                    admirer and 1 imitator of Chaucer, but the Teutonic affinities of his mind waxed
                    ever stronger, and he ended by gaining great <pb break="no"

                    satires, directed against the abuses of his day, especially those which deformed
                    the church. His latest work, a <hi rend="italic">Dialog concerning the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Monarchen</hi> appeared in 1553.</p>
                <p>Tn the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama</hi> it was described how the modern
                    drama grew up under the shadow of the church, and an attempt was made to convey
                    a clear notion of the - mode in which the ancient miracle plays were performed.
                    As the people grew richer and more numerous, and the arts of life were improved,
                    and experience suggested ways of correcting blemishes and adding fresh splendour
                    to the spectacle, these plays were exhibited with ever increasing pomp. Yet, at
                    the same time, the lay spirit getting hold of them more and more, and the
                    religious laxity of the Renaissance attacking the clergy, we find those which
                    date from the 15th century not only grotesque, but gross to the last degree.
                    Their composition in many parts betrays a scandalous accommodation or
                    condescension to the brutality or pruriency of the hearers. Take for instance,
                    the scene called “The Bridal of Mary and Joseph” in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coventry Mysteries.</hi> To interest masses of ignorant people it may have been
                    necessary to be simple, broad, and outspoken; but it could not have been
                    necessary to introduce a heap of filthy jokes, not found in their original,
                    gathering round the mystery of the Incarnation, for the sake of raising a
                    horse-laugh, and covering the cheeks of the country girls with blushes. It must
                    be remembered that the entire system of language and allusions in these plays is
                    <hi rend="italic">contemporary.</hi> Mary’s kinsman, Abizachar, is a mediaeval
                    bishop, with his court, his sumpnours, and his apparitors; the whole thing is
                    racy of the soil, and redolent of the national humour; you are no more
                    transported into Palestine than a travestie of “Medea” transports you into
                    Greece. The moral effects upon juvenile spectators of so much loose talk,
                    conveyed to them as it was with a <hi rend="italic">sanction</hi> (for a
                    religious aim was always professed, and indeed as a rule sincerely entertained
                    in these exhibitions), cannot have been of an improving nature.</p>
                <p>Besides the great serial plays, such as <hi rend="italic">The Chester—The
                    Coventry—</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Townley Mysteries,</hi> in the
                    successive scenes of which all the principal truths and doctrines of religion,
                    beginning with the creation, and ending with “Doomsday,” were represented, a
                    demand arose for special plays, treating of the life, or the miracles, or the
                    martyrdom of some favourite saint. Such were <hi rend="italic">The Conversion of
                    St Paul, St Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">St Anne,</hi> which may be
                    seen in a MS. in the Bodleian library. These were sometimes performed in the
                    churches, on the festival of the saint celebrated in them, sometimes in the
                    halls of royal palaces or colleges, sometimes again within the precincts of
                    monasteries. Gradually something more refined, more in the fashion, than any
                    -miracle play, was called for at courts and colleges. Then arose the moral
                    plays, in which the allegorical treatment and metaphysical refinements which
                    were of the taste of the age were applied to dramatic entertainments. Saints and
                    angels were discarded; and virtues, vices, and abstract notions of various kinds
                    took their place as the <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae.</hi> The devil of
                    the miracle plays, who had more and more become a grotesque and comic character,
                    at least in many of them, appeared as the “vice” or “iniquity” of the moral
                    plays, and introduced into them also a corresponding comic element; this “vice,”
                    as is "well known, was gradually transformed into the clown of the modern stage.
                    Skelton wrote two moral plays, one called <hi rend="italic">The
                    Nigramaηsir,</hi> which was performed before Henry VII. and his court at
                    Woodstock, the other <hi rend="italic">Magnyfycence.</hi> A more ambitious
                    effort was the <hi rend="italic">Satyre</hi><hi rend="italic">of Thrie
                    Estaits,</hi> by Lindsay; this enormous moral play was acted before the Scottish
                    court in 1535, and occupied nine hours in the representation. The dulness and
                    tediousness of plays of this kind, owing to the want of human interest,
                    prevented them from holding their ground against the more natural form of the
                    drama which the imitation of the ancients soon introduced; yet Air Collier, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">History of Dramatic Poetry,</hi> has shown that moral
                    plays continued to be written down to the very end of the reign of Elizabeth.
                    Translations and imitations of the plays of Plautus and Terence paved the way
                    for the reign of a purer taste. Sixteen years after it had witnessed <hi
                    rend="italic">The. Nigrarnansir,</hi> the English court was refreshed by “a
                    goodie comédie of Plautus,” probably through the instrumentality of Sir Thomas
                    More, who was then in high favour with Henry. The interludes of John Heywood,
                    court-jester to the same king, were another step in advance. The personified
                    qualities are here dropped, and persons take their place; these persons,
                    however, are not yet individuals, but representatives of classes, “a pedlar,” “a
                    palmer,” &amp;c. The earliest proper comedy that has yet been discovered is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ralph Roister Doister</hi> of Nicholas Udall, the head master
                    of Eton College. In this play, written to be performed by his scholars, Udall
                    imitates so far as he can the style and manner of Terence. It is divided into
                    acts and scenes, and is written in hobbling alexandrine rhyming lines, which, as
                    containing twelve syllables, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> six feet, he obviously
                    thought were the nearest English reproduction of the iambic trimeter. He did not
                    see that the movement of our heroic blank verse, in spite of its being shorter
                    by two syllables, represents more faithfully than any other English metre the
                    movement of the iambic trimeter; while such rough alexandrines as his only
                    recall the Saturnian verse of Naevius. The recognition of the fact that for the
                    English drama the proper metre is the blank verse of ten syllables was due to
                    the finer perceptions of Sackville, who, with Norton, produced the tragedy of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ferrex and Porrex,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gorbοdue,</hi> in
                    1561; this, the earliest regular tragedy that has been discovered, was played
                    before Queen Elizabeth in the hall of the Inner Temple. For some years the drama
                    continued to be beholden to the hospitality of the court, or some legal society,
                    or educational institution (Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, St Paul’s school,
                    &lt;fcc.), for the local habitation where it might display its illusions. But as
                    the popular delight in such exhibitions increased at this time faster than the
                    Puritanic aversion to them (although this also was gaining ground, as we shall
                    see), it was in evitable that the stage should cease to be movable and
                    migratory, and establish itself in a permanent home. The first public theatre
                    was opened at Blackfriars in 1575; the histrionic art became a recognized
                    profession; many other theatres sprang up before the end of the century; Italian
                    plays were adapted, Latin plays translated, episodes of English history
                    dramatized; and, on the whole, a kind of dramatic atmosphere was generated in
                    the English metropolis, highly favourable to the career of a great artist,
                    should such a one appear.</p>
                <p>More’s philosophical fiction of <hi rend="italic">Utopia,</hi> imitated from
                    Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Atlantis,</hi> appeared in Latin in 1516; it is the
                    picture of an ideal commonwealth. The <hi rend="italic">Goνernour,</hi> by Sir
                    Thomas Elyot, was also intended to be a political treatise; but under the
                    despotism of Henry « the subject was too dangerous, and the author confines
                    himself almost entirely to questions connected with education. The earliest good
                    English prose, in Mr Hallam’s opinion, is found in Sir Thomas More’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Henry V.,</hi> which appeared in 1513. But the curious
                    treatise by Sir John Fortescue, written more than thirty years before, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Difference between an A bsolute and a Limited Monarchy,</hi> is
                    really very good English, and contains few words that are not now in use; if it
                    were divested of its barbarous <pb break="no"

                    prose style was much improved by the various works of Roger Ascham, who taught
                    Latin to Elizabeth, and held learned conversations with Lady Jane Grey.</p>
                <p>The religious convulsions by which the country was shaken to its centre during
                    this period are of little direct interest to the historian of literature; for
                    the lines of literary development which the activity of preceding ages had
                    marked out were not seriously deflected, nor did the theological controversy
                    produce on either side works which, like Hooker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> or Bossuet’s <hi rend="italic">Variations,</hi> may
                    claim, on account of perfection of style or power of treatment, a permanent
                    place in literature. The Reformers of Henry the VIII.’s reign were the heirs and
                    continuators of “Lollardy,” but joined to it, from the armoury of Luther and
                    Calvin, new views on predestination, the futility of works, justification by
                    faith alone, and the final assurance of the elect, which had indeed a practical
                    bearing of the most important kind, but were not set forth by our native writers
                    in particularly forcible terms or attractive forms. William Tyndale, who carried
                    on a long and acrimonious controversy with Sir Thomas More, is perhaps the most
                    important writer on that side. Cranmer’s writings show much learning,
                    considerable grasp of intellect, and a certain beadth of style; they are
                    deficient, however, in sincerity and manliness. The homely wit and rough
                    satirical power of Latimer are well illustrated in many of his sermons. He, and
                    most of the English Reformers, exemplify in a marked way the Teutonic affinity
                    of which we have more than once spoken; the desire to be sturdily independent,
                    coupled with a sense of teeming latent energy,—of a potentiality of great
                    achievement on this side and on that,—indicate in them at once the strength and
                    the blemish of the Teutonic genius. After the accession of Elizabeth, the
                    leading men among the clergy, refusing to take the oath of supremacy, were for
                    the most part driven into exile, and for many years waged war, in heavy treatise
                    or light pamphlet, against the new settlement of religion. The names of Sander,
                    Harpsfield, Harding, Stapleton, and many others occur in this connexion. But as
                    they wrote for the most part in Latin, for the sake of Continental readers,
                    their efforts produced little effect, and are now scarcely remembered. Jewel,
                    the Protestant bishop of Salisbury, who had been in exile at Strasburg under
                    Mary, and contracted a close friendship with Peter Martyr, wrote an <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology</hi> (1562) in reply to these disputants, from whom the
                    work drew forth loud charges of inaccuracy and unfairness of quotation. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology</hi> was in Latin, but the <hi rend="italic">Defence of
                    the Apology,</hi> written in answer to Harding, was in English. The laborious
                    exercise of thought on these topics, and the warfare with pen and tongue which
                    was the result, could not fail to increase the elasticity and enlarge the
                    adaptivity of the language, and so far tended to improve it as an organ of
                    literature.</p>
                <p>VI, <hi rend="italic">The Old Civilization in conflict with Puritanism,</hi>
                    1579-1660.—Regarding the position of the Roman see in the Christian church as a
                    “separable accident,” the acceptance or rejection of which made no essential
                    difference, the literary men of the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth, while
                    rejecting, chiefly on political grounds, the authority of that see, had no
                    quarrel in other respects with the religion which had come down to them from
                    their forefathers, nor with the forms of civilization and efforts towards a
                    higher culture which that religion had encouraged. Both in Spenser and
                    Shakespeare we notice a decided repugnance towards Rome, and a disposition to
                    deny her claim to obedience (compare the description of Duessa in the Faerie <hi
                    rend="italic">Queens,</hi> and the denunciation of papal power put by
                    Shakespeare in the mouth of King John); but with this exception they belong to
                    the old school; they might have been Englishmen of fifty years before, instead
                    of twenty or thirty years after, the Reformation. This has been pointed out in
                    detail by Mr Thornbury and others in the case of Shakespeare; they have shown
                    how alien the notions of Puritanism were to his heart and mind, except in the
                    one point of opposition to'Rome. Spenser’s description of the house of Coelia,
                    and his invective against the Blatant Beast, not to refer to many other
                    passages, show that the same thing held good of him. But it is not our object to
                    dwell on this; the point to which we would call attention is, that the poets and
                    dramatists of this period, as well as a large body of the clergy, clave heartily
                    to the civilization and culture which they had inherited from the past. To this
                    form of civilization the Puritan or ultra-reforming party, which began to show
                    its strength under the lax rule of Archbishop Grindal, was radically opposed.
                    The culture which bad gathered treasures from every side, and welcomed all that
                    was good and beautiful in paganism, was tainted and abominable in their eyes. To
                    them it seemed that a Christian society should be exclusively formed and built
                    up on models furnished by the Old and New Testaments. To come to the particular
                    tendencies of Puritanism with which we have now to do,—it looked with sour
                    displeasure on the English poetry and drama of the day, and, according as it
                    possessed power, suppressed them. What meant these loose and profane sonneteers
                    by writing about their mistresses in language that was little short of
                    idolatrous, and celebrating Bacchus, Venus, and Apollo in terms which could
                    hardly be acquitted of blasphemy? Why, if they must rhyme, could they not
                    compose comfortable hymns of Zion, and if they must have music, sing the Psalms
                    of David? Expression was given to these sentiments in a pamphlet breathing a
                    spirit of comparative moderation,— the <hi rend="italic">School of Abuse</hi> of
                    Stephen Gosson (1579). Sir Philip Sidney in his able reply, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Defence of Poesy,</hi> vindicated; the legitimacy of the taste for
                    literature and art which Englishmen had inherited from their forefathers. Again,
                    innumerable allusions in the works of the dramatists of this and the next reign,
                    including Shakespeare, prove the animosity which subsisted between them and the
                    Puritans, whom they rightly regarded as the implacable enemies of their art. On
                    the outbreak of civil war the Puritans, gaining the upper hand in London,
                    immediately shut up the theatres. It is not, therefore, without reason that we
                    have characterized the epoch which we are considering as that of the “conflict
                    between Puritanism and the old civilization.”</p>
                <p>Poetry, which does not, like the drama in its more developed stages, require any
                    local establishment in order to produce its effects, pursued its flight in
                    defiance of Puritan censure. It was not, however, unaffected by it. The
                    disapproval of him and his works, entertained by a large section among the most
                    virtuous of his countrymen, irritated the poet by its exaggeration, and often
                    made him out of recklessness import an additional degree of licence into his
                    language. Yet morality was in the end the gainer. For in spite of narrowness,
                    and exaggeration, and occasional hypocrisy, there was real earnestness and
                    virtuous intention in the great body of the Puritans; and to these qualities
                    society eventually did homage by refusing to tolerate, in poetry at least, what
                    was openly and scandalously immoral. In spite of one or two who leap over the
                    line, poetry in the 18th century, and still more in the 19th, has not permitted
                    her votaries to write as they please, but has prescribed to them measure and
                    seemliness. This may indeed be attributed to the increasing refinement of
                    European life, but that refinement itself, so far as it is moral, is to a large
                    extent the work of the Puritan spirit.</p>

                <p>Without further preface let us turn to the consideration of that amaziDg
                    phenomenon, the literature of the Elizabethan age. Many circumstances, many
                    slowly elaborated changes, had prepared the way. The cautious peace-policy of
                    Elizabeth, her wise love of economy, and her care to surround herself with able
                    counsellors, produced their natural fruits in a state of general prosperity
                    never experienced before. Every adventurous and inquiring mind was stimulated by
                    the reports continually arriving of the discovery of “islands far away,” of
                    riches and beauty which the earth had hitherto veiled from her children revealed
                    to wondering eyes in America and the East, of inventions which enlarged the
                    power, and discoveries which widened the knowledge, of man. Again, the greatly
                    augmented use of the language as a literary instrument, consequent upon the
                    religious dissensions now temporarily, silenced, had, as already explained, made
                    it a much fitter organ for thought than it had been in the reign of Henry VIIL
                    Lastly, the powerful influences now pressing in from abroad must be duly
                    weighed. The genius of Ariosto had clothed mediaeval romance in a splendid garb,
                    which, for the first time since the 13th century, made the subject attractive to
                    cultivated minds. Ta3so ’ s epic, with its sustained grace and sweetness, had
                    shown how the shades and half-shades of sentiment in which refined spirits
                    delight can be expressed by corresponding <hi rend="italic">nuances</hi> of
                    language. Certain eminent writers in France, especially Du Bellay and Ronsard,
                    had consecrated considerable powers and incessant activity to the work of
                    reforming the language and literature of their own country through the
                    concentrated study and fearless imitation of ancient models. Considering all
                    these various elements, we shall be better able to understand how, given a
                    gorgeous imagination like that of Spenser, and a mind of universal range like
                    that of Shakespeare, these writers were able to place that enormous difference
                    between themselves and their predecessors which separates the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faerie Queene</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Pastime of Pleasure,</hi> and the
                    comedies of Shakespeare from those of Still and Udall.</p>
                <p>Without stopping to criticise, and reserving the drama for separate
                    consideration, we must endeavour by a brief description to convey some notion of
                    the poetical exuberance of the Elizabethan era. Spenser’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faerie Queene,</hi> a colossal fragment of a still more colossal design,
                    relates ostensibly the romantic adventures of brave knights and fair ladies; but
                    every incident has an allegorical meaning, and the propagation of the several
                    moral virtues is the professed object of the entire work. The well-known stanza
                    which he invented, consisting of nine lines, the last an alexandrine, with three
                    rhymes, is so skilfully constructed and so well adapted to our language, that it
                    has been frequently employed since, with marked success, by eminent poets. Burns
                    used it for the <hi rend="italic">Cotter’s Saturday Night,</hi> and Byron for
                    <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold.</hi> The rhymes in it are better arranged than
                    in the standard metre of Italy, the <hi rend="italic">ottavα rima,</hi> because
                    the distribution is such as to bind the whole structure better together, and to
                    avoid that palpable break between the first six lines and the concluding couplet
                    which is noticeable in the stanza of Tasso and Ariosto. Again, the extra
                    syllables in the ninth line seem exactly to counterbalance the risk of <hi
                    rend="italic">monotony</hi> which the additional line would otherwise entail.
                    The sonnets of Shakespeare, if we accept the acute interpretation of Mr Simpson,
                    indicate the influence of some aristocratic friend of the poet, who, having
                    travelled much in Italy and formed the acquaintance of members of the learned
                    “academes” for which Italian cities, were then famous, had learned from them
                    those Platonizing speculations about love and its kinds—the vulgar, the civil,
                    the chivalrous, and the ideal love—which are partially reproduced in the
                    sonnets. Among Shakespeare’s other poems the chief were <hi rend="italic">Venus
                    and Adonis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the Pape of Lucreece,</hi> pieces
                    remarkable for their luscious melody and ornate elegance. The classical and
                    mythological themes attest at once the receptivity of the intellect of
                    Shakespeare, a country-bred youth who had studied at neither university, and the
                    strength of the Renaissance movement, from which no mind, even the most
                    powerful, could then hold itself aloof. Of the same class is Marlowe’s beautiful
                    poem of <hi rend="italic">Hero and Leander,</hi> translated from the Greek of
                    the pseudo-Musaeus. George Chapman produced, about 1601, a complete translation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in long fourteen syllable lines. It was the
                    first time that this feat had been accomplished in any modern language; and the
                    fact well typifies the intensity of force with which the English intellect was
                    now working in every direction. Robert Southwell, the Jesuit, put to death by
                    the Government in 1696, left behind him a few religious poems of great beauty.
                    He is by some considered the first of the metaphysical school of poets; but the
                    credit (or discredit) of that leadership rather belongs to Donne. Marston, Hall,
                    and Gascoigne (the author of the <hi rend="italic">Steel Glass)</hi> may be
                    regarded as the founders of English satire. Sir Philip Sidney, the ornament of
                    Elizabeth’s court, wrote sonnets and songs, which, though imitated from Italian
                    and Spanish models, were freighted by his powerful mind with a burden of thought
                    and passion not to be found in the originals. The attempts of Daniel and Drayton
                    in the epic style (<hi rend="italic">Wars of the Poses, Barons'</hi>
                    lΓ&lt;Z7∙s), were failures; but wherever we meet with many ventures, it cannot
                    be but that some will fail. Of such poems as Warner’s <hi rend="italic">Albion’s
                    England,</hi> or Drayton’s <hi rend="italic">Poly-Olbion,</hi> or Tusser’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Five Hundred Points of Husbandry,</hi> it is unnecessary to
                    speak.</p>
                <p>The class of poets to whom Johnson attached the name “metaphysical,” while Milton
                    calls them “fantastics,” includes Donne their founder, Cowley, Crashaw,
                    Cleveland, and several others. In date they belong rather to the reigns of James
                    I. and Charles I. than to that of Elizabeth. They are distinguished by their
                    fondness for “conceits,” or intellectual <hi rend="italic">tours de force,</hi>
                    the general aim of which was to gain credit for ingenuity, and a deep insight
                    into the nature of things, by tracing resemblances or analogies between objects
                    apparently remote and diverse. This poetry of conceit, which nearly corresponded
                    to the <hi rend="italic">estilo</hi><hi rend="italic">culto</hi> of Spain, is
                    usually said to have been invented by the Neapolitan poet Marini, author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sospetto di Erode,</hi> and by him propagated in France,
                    whence it came to England. It was merely another development of that tendency to
                    the mystical in thought and the far-fetched in language, characteristic of the
                    Gothic ages, which we have seen more fully exemplified in the countless
                    allegories and moral plays of previous periods. In Donne the style is
                    insufferable; “conceits” are strewn about his pages like puns about the
                    conversation of a punster, and they are not half so amusing. Cowley, on the
                    other hand, was a true poet; the daring flights of his fancy, the tenderness of
                    his feelings, and the grace and profoundness of his musings, still rescue much
                    that he wrote from oblivion. Composing, in imitation of Pindar (though he did
                    not really understand the Pindaric metres), irregular passages of song which. he
                    called “Pindariques,” he gave the first example of a class of poems which
                    comprises performances so memorable as the <hi rend="italic">Alexander's
                    Feast</hi> of Dryden and the <hi rend="italic">Barel</hi> of Gray. Crashaw, the
                    translator of the <hi rend="italic">Sospetto di Erode,</hi> is in the highest
                    degree a worshipper of the far-fetched. He is the author of the celebrated line,
                    describing the miracle of Cana in Galilee,—</p>
                <p>Lympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit.</p>

                    in the world, and had too much good taste and good sense, to go very far with
                    them. He is the English song-writer <hi rend="italic">par excellence;</hi> his
                    is the only name which we can think of, when Burns is cited for Scotland and
                    Béranger for France. His manner was so good and his style so clear that Dryden
                    calls him the “father of English numbers,” and declares that but for him “none
                    of us could write.” Pope allows to Waller <hi rend="italic">smoothness,</hi> but
                    ascribes much more to the influence of Dryden himself:</p>
                <p>“Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join The varying verse, the full
                    resounding line, The long majestic march, and energy divine.”</p>
                <p>In the last section we noticed the rise of true comedy and tragedy, and gave the
                    date of the building of the first regular theatre at the Blackfriars. Returning
                    to the subject, we propose to examine the commencements of the Elizabethan drama
                    in somewhat more detail, treating (1) of the actors, (2) of the plays which they
                    performed, (3) of the stages which they had at their disposal, including under
                    this head their resources of scenery and stage effect.</p>
                <p>1. From an early periol of the reign we find frequent mention of companies of
                    players travelling from town to town, and performing in the town-halls, under
                    the sanction of, and with remuneration from, the respective corporations, such
                    of the plays which they had brought as might seem suitable to the audience
                    expected. It is noteworthy that every such company announced itself as “the
                    servants” of my lord this, or the earl of that, and indeed were really such; had
                    they given themselves out for an independent body of· players, the stern laws
                    against vagabondage then prevailing would have made ’ them at once amenable to
                    the sharp jurisdiction of the local magistrates. Thus we read of the servants of
                    the Lord Strange, those of the earls of Leicester, Warwick, Derby, &amp;c. These
                    noblemen enrolled the bands of players among their retainers, and probably
                    maintained and gave them wages for a part of the year, but allowed them at other
                    times, under the patronage of their high names and with licences under their
                    hands, to make a living by entertaining the public. It was the servants of the
                    earl of Leicester who in 1574 obtained from the queen a writ under the privy
                    seal, authorizing them to perform “comedies, tragedies, interludes, stage-plays,
                    and such other like as they have already used and studied, or hereafter shall
                    use and study, as well in the city of London as throughout the realm of
                    England.” But when the players prepared to avail themselves of their privilege,
                    a conflict of authorities became apparent. The mayor and corporation of London
                    asserted their right of control over all dramatic performances within the limits
                    of the city, and issued orders providing, amongst other things, that the players
                    whom they might license should contribute half their receipts to charitable
                    purposes. Probably a portion of the corporation was, even at this early period,
                    actuated by Puritan sentiments. The poor players, who under such regulations
                    would have soon found their occupation gone, or at any rate unremunerative,
                    turned their eye to the vacant spice between St Paul’s and the river, where
                    stood the ruins of the great convent and church of the Black Friars
                    (Dominicans). On this site, which was outside the jurisdiction of the city, they
                    established the first theatre by converting to their purpose some of the
                    dilapidated buildings. Years passed; the number of the players increased; and in
                    1589, as we learn from a curious memorial which they addressed in that year to
                    the privy council, they were sixteen in number, “all of them sharers in the
                    Blackfriars play-house.” The twelfth name subscribed to this list was that of
                    William Shakespeare; the ninth that of the dramatist George Peele. These facts
                    show that that “separation of powers,” which, in the drama as in politics, is
                    the fruit of an advanced experience, did not then exist. The offices of lessee,
                    stage-manager, actor, and play-writer were all combined in these early players.
                    They owned the theatre in which they acted, furnished their own stage, chose
                    their own plays, and, to a greater or less extent, wrote them. After having
                    received the royal licence in 1574, this company ceased to bear the name of the
                    earl of Leicester, but described themselves as “Her Majesty’s poor players.” The
                    trace of this early connection with the court still remains in the appellation
                    “Theatre Royal,” assumed by several of the older London theatres.</p>
                <p>2. With regard to the nature of the dramatic performances, these included,
                    besides those specified in the licence to the Blackfriars Company, moral plays
                    and histories. Under the general description of moral play we may include those
                    that were written with a controversial purpose, either for or against the
                    Reformation, such as the plays by Bishop Bale, <hi rend="italic">Lusty Juventus,
                    Every Man, fyc.</hi> Quite a number of such pieces were put on the stage by the
                    Catholics after the accession of Elizabeth, with the view of turning the new
                    state services into ridicule; these drew down a special prohibition from the
                    Government. Many dramas, called sometimes tragedies, sometimes histories, were
                    on classical subjects, such as <hi rend="italic">Catiline’s Conspiracies</hi>
                    (by Stephen Gosson, who afterwards wrote vehemently against the stage), <hi
                    rend="italic">Cupid and Psyche, Ptolemy,</hi> and plays on the lives of Pompey
                    and Caesar. The audience being limited, the companies of players numerous, and
                    the expense of scenery and dresses trifling, novelty in the pieces represented
                    became the predominant source ofattraction; hence the extraordinary variety of
                    plays produced at this early period. Scriptural subjects were popular; thus
                    among the earliest printed plays are Nash’s <hi rend="italic">Christ's Tears
                    over Jerusalem,</hi> and Peele’s <hi rend="italic">David and Bethsabe.</hi>
                    “Histories” dealt often with personages and events of the ancient world. But
                    they also presented in dramatic forms passages from the story of England, many
                    of which, by tradition and continual discussion, still lived in the memory, and
                    vividly stirred the feelings of the people; and it was natural that dramas of
                    this class, as they came to be planned with more art and composed with greater
                    power, should transcend in interest the dramas with classical plots, and
                    appropriate the name of “histories” to themselves. One of the earliest of these,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Famous Victories of Henry V.,</hi> was acted about 1580;
                    Shakespeare founded on it one of his historical plays. The history of <hi
                    rend="italic">Edward II.</hi> by Marlowe, Greene’s <hi rend="italic">James
                    IV.,</hi> and Peele’s <hi rend="italic">Edward I.</hi> all date somewhere about
                    1590; the older play of <hi rend="italic">King John</hi> appeared in 1591; and
                    the original plays which, refashioned or retouched by the hand of Shakespeare,
                    come before us as the three parts of <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.,</hi> seem to
                    have been produced between 1590 and 1595.</p>
                <p>Before the time when Shakespeare began to write for the stage, it may be said
                    that several respectable or even remarkable tragedies had appeared, that some
                    good and flowing historical dramas had been written, and that a great variety of
                    interludes, approaching in character to our farces, and not deficient in wit and
                    drollery, had been produced. To prove the above assertion as to tragedy, it
                    would be enough to adduce Marlowe’s powerful plays, <hi rend="italic">Dr
                    Faustus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tamburlaine the Great,—</hi> the first strong
                    to move the tragic passions, the second dazzling and astonishing us by its
                    soaring rants and gorgeous rhetoric. The clever interludes of John Heywood would
                    alone sustain what we have stated as to pieces of that description. In comedy,
                    on the other hand, very little had been achieved. Of those that were in prose,
                    like Gascoigne’s <hi rend="italic">Supposes</hi> and Nash’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pierce Penniless,</hi> the rough uncouth language was unrelieved by any wit
                    that could pass muster in a later age. No comedies in verse superior to those of
                    Greene can perhaps<pb break="no"

                    of literary fault,</p>
                <p>3. With regard to the stage itself, the building of the first theatre in London
                    has been already described. But for many years previously temporary theatres had
                    been made out of the court-yards, with their surrounding galleries, of London
                    inns, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> the Belle
                    Savage in Ludgate Hill, the Red Bull in Bishopsgate Street, and the Cross Keys
                    in Gracechurch Street. It is to the second of these that Gosson alludes in his
                    <hi rend="italic">School of Abuse</hi> (1579), when he speaks of “the Jew shown
                    at the Bull,” and goes on to describe it so as to make it clear that this was an
                    old play with a plot resembling that of the <hi rend="italic">Merchant of
                    Venice,</hi> If any one desires it, he may still help his imagination to picture
                    the scene, by going into the court-yard of one of the few old city inns still
                    left, the “Four Swans” in Bishopsgate Street for instance, and imagining a stage
                    erected at one end, the galleries crowded with aristocratic spectators, seated
                    or standing, and the open space below filled with play-goers of the common sort,
                    admitted at the charge of one penny, and with the canopy of heaven above their
                    heads. Five of these theatrical inns were turned into play-houses between 1570
                    and 1630. The company that owned the Blackfriars Theatre erected a new one
                    called the Globe in 1594 on the Bank-side, a position corresponding to one on
                    the present Thames embankment; this, being for summer use, was not roofed in. A
                    play-house called “The Theatre” was built at Shoreditch, outside the city
                    liberties, little, if at all, after the time at which the Blackfriars house was
                    opened , near it stood the “Curtain.” Other theatres, the Swan, the Hope, the
                    Rose, &amp;c., rapidly sprang up; and it is estimated that not fewer than 200
                    licensed play-houses existed in different parts of London at the end of the
                    reign of Elizabeth. All this time the players continued, to desiguate
                    themselves, and to be, the servants either of the queen or of some nobleman;
                    without such protection they could not have exercised their function either
                    safely or profitably. In these primitive theatres no scenery was used; that was
                    first introduced by Davenant after the Restoration. A curtain then, as now, met
                    the spectator’s eye on entering; it was slowly drawn up, and he saw a stage
                    strewn with rushes, the side walls hung with arras; a large board with a name
                    painted on it, “Westminster,” “Corinth,” “Messina,” &amp;c., informed him where
                    the scene of the play to be performed was laid; imagination did all the rest.
                    When a battle was to be fought, “two armies fly in represented with four swords
                    and bucklers, aud then what hard heart will not receive it for a pitched field?

                <p>Amidst such rude surroundings, and with such imperfect appliances, the mighty
                    genius of Shakespeare was fain to live and act. It has been observed that
                    English comedy was less advanced at the time of his coming up to London (about
                    1586) than the other dramatic forms; and it is in comedy accordingly that his
                    early triumphs were won, and his extraordinary superiority to all his
                    predecessors most signally demonstrated. <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's
                    Lost</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Comedy of Errors</hi> were probably his
                    first essays; they were followed by <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream,
                    Two Gentlemen of Verona,</hi> &lt;fcc. The versification of dramatic dialogue
                    had been thoroughly reformed by Marlowe, whose sense of rhythm was exquisite;
                    English blank verse had been wrought into a fine and fitting material, ready to
                    receive whatever impression a gifted dramatist might stamp upon it. But Marlowe
                    was no meditative observer of human life, no accurate discerner of human
                    motives. The language, therefore, that he puts in the mouth of his different
                    personages does not greatly vary; they are all apt to take to ranting on the
                    least provocation. Shakespeare added to Marlowe’s skill of composition a power
                    of characterization which no dramatist, ancient or modern, ever surpassed. To
                    this power, as its fitting accompaniment, was joined a gift of modulation, by
                    which the language assigned to each character was made suitable to it and to no
                    other, and this with a truth and naturalness which the readers and spectators of
                    every following age have recognized. Again, turning, like Chaucer, with eager
                    longing to the refining influences which came from the south, he adjusted and
                    polished his dialogue with the utmost care, till to the swiftness aud evenness
                    of movement which he might have learnt from Marlowe he united much of the easy
                    grace of Ariosto and of the sweetness of Tasso. He probably read an immense
                    number of Italian novels, either in the original or in translations; many of his
                    comedies are founded upon such tales. Thus prepared, he could with safety, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Merry</hi> Jl⅛s <hi rend="italic">of Windsor,</hi> deal with
                    home scenes, and a plot of his own invention, without running any risk of
                    falling into the coarseness and vulgarity of <hi rend="italic">Gammer Gurion,
                    George-a-Greene,</hi> and hundreds of other pieces, written by men in whom the
                    Teutonic affinity of the race predominated unchecked. To these qualifications
                    Shakespeare added a sound dramatic judgment, which, as was natural, improved
                    with years and experience, teaching him what to seek and what to shun, so as to
                    secure that popularity which is the test of dramatic excellence. As an acting
                    play, <hi rend="italic">The Temp&gt;est,</hi> written near the end of his
                    career, is far superior to <hi rend="italic">Love’s Labour</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">s Lost.</hi> But to the last he did not attain to supreme
                    excellence in this direction; the unity of action, necessarily sacrificed in the
                    histories, is not always preserved in. dramas where its retention would have
                    been easy; nor is that subordination of inferior parts to the central action,
                    which dramatists of less power have often successfully managed, always duly
                    atteuded to by Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>Of neither the comedies nor the tragedies of Shakespeare can it be said that they
                    are in a special sense “dramas of character.” The boasting soldier, the lying
                    traveller, the religious hypocrite, the scheming matron, the ambitious tyrant,
                    and many other clearly marked types, are not pourtrayed for us in the plays of
                    Shakespeare with that sharpness of outline which they present in the works of
                    Plautus, Molière, and Alfieri. The cause may perhaps be sought in the absence
                    from Shakespeare’s mind of all exaggeration, and in the fact that without some
                    slight exaggeration these striking dramatic types which take hold on the memory
                    and the imagination cannot, be produced. Shakespeare saw men as they are, and so
                    described them; and the consequence is that, although neither Macbeth nor
                    Richard III. exhibits the stock character of the “ambitious tyrant,” each
                    displays a special form of ambition, modified, as always happens in real life,
                    by many concomitant qualities and aims, to trace the lineaments of which will
                    reward in a high degree the pains of the literary analyst. It is this quality of
                    essential truth of presentation which has gathered round our Shakespeare’s
                    dramas the instructive and beautiful criticism of a Gervinus, the
                    interpretations of a Goethe, and the historic faculty of a Guizot or a
                    Villemain.</p>
                <p>In the exhibition of tragic passions, and in the range of the appeal which they
                    make to the moral sentiments of an audience, Shakespeare’s tragedies have never
                    been surpassed. Considered as acting plays they are of varying excellence. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> both
                    founded on Italian novels, the incidents move on in a ’ swift and well-combined
                    sequence,, which, from this point of view, leaves nothing to be desired. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> though from tradition and habit it always attracts
                    large audiences, is better suited for the closet than the stage; the <hi
                    rend="italic">drag</hi> of the third and fourth acts is undeniable. In none of
                    the tragedies is there any <pb break="no"

                    <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet;</hi> here the action is powerfully and
                    successfully concentrated. The Roman plays, based on Plutarch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives,</hi> though they abound in passages of great power and
                    beauty, are not so constructed as to produce the highest dramatic effect.</p>
                <p>When we turn to the other dramatists, Shakespeare’s contemporaries and
                    successors, the one point about them all that most strikes us is, their amazing
                    exuberance. The English genius, as M. Taine in substance remarks, is naturally
                    abundant and full of force; if left to itself, it attends more to quantity than
                    to quality; it is daring and enterprising, and knows not when it is over
                    matched, as English soldiers are said not to know when they are beaten. Of this
                    national vigour a large proportion was in the Elizabethan times directed to
                    literature, and particularly to the stage. The development of the drama had now
                    gone on without any notable check for many generations. All the artistic faculty
                    of the country which before the Reformation had applied itself to other arts,
                    such as decorative architecture, painting, and sculpture, now, when the scope
                    for the exercise of these was suddenly reduced to the narrowest limits, tended
                    to seek and find a refuge in the Thespi an art. Space does not permit of our
                    noticing these dramatists in any but the briefest manner. Ben Jonson, proud of
                    his learning and his university education, invented most of his own plots, and
                    plumed himself on his strict observance of the unities. In the plays of Beaumont
                    and Fletcher the influence of the Spanish drama, the glory of which had been
                    carried to a great height by Calderon and Lope de Vega, is noticeable. The
                    intensity of Massinger and the pathos of Ford, amid much that is grotesque or
                    repulsive, preserve their dramas from entire oblivion. Other names are those of
                    Webster, Chapman, Heywood, Dekker, Marston, Middleton, and Rowley. The plays of
                    Shirley were at the height of their popularity when, after the breaking out of
                    the civil war, the theatres were closed by order of the parliament. This order
                    is the overt act of Puritanism, by which, after having first complained of, then
                    protested against, then furiously denounced, the abuses of the stage, it
                    proceeds, now that it has got the handling of the civil sword, to remove both
                    use and abuse by force. The violent language of Prynne in the book (1633) to
                    which he gave the title of <hi rend="italic">Histriοmastix</hi> (a barbarous
                    compound signifying “the player’s scourge ”), though at the time cruelly
                    punished by the Star Chamber, told of a great and increasing force of public
                    opinion behind him, of which he wa3 but the mouth-piece. Puritanism, by the
                    order of suppression, at once avenged the insults and ridicule with which the
                    dramatists had assailed it, and cut down a vigorous scion which had grown up out
                    of the root of the ancient civilization. The drama was restored before twenty
                    years were over; but it was a new creation, and never won the people’s love as
                    the old Elizabethan drama had done. It was an affair of courts and coteries, and
                    was almost shaken down by the blunt reproaches of one honest, plain-spoken man,
                    Jeremy Collier. Puritanism possessing itself more and more of the popular
                    conscience, the revival of a <hi rend="italic">national</hi> drama became
                    impossible. Our theatres are supported by the miscellaneous urban population
                    which is always to be found in great cities; but as a nation we have had no
                    drama since the civil war.</p>
                <p>In the department of Fiction we have to note a new transformation of the romance,
                    by which it assumes the form of pastoral novel. The tale of chivalry, modified
                    so as to recommend a religious ideal by Walter Map and his fellow workers, then
                    passing into the love-story with allegorical embellishments in the hands of
                    Lorris, was further changed by Sannazzaro, Montemayor, and other Spanish and
                    Italian writers, into the love-story with pastoral and mythological
                    embellishments. Here of course we trace the influence of the classical revival ·
                    allegory is dropped as too cumbrous; and a florid phraseology, culled from the
                    idylls of Theocritus, the miscellaneous works of Lucian, and other classical or
                    quaei-classical sources, takes its place. The <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> of
                    Sir Philip Sidney was suggested by Sannazzaro’s pastoral romance of the same
                    name, but can be read with more interest, because we see that it has been made
                    the vehicle by means of which a powerful mind makes known its thoughts on many
                    intricate and important questions, in metaphysics, political science, art, and
                    social ethics. But the prolixity of the work, together with its confused
                    arrangement, would always prevent it from attaining to anything like the
                    popularity which it enjoyed when, and for some time after, it appeared. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Euphues</hi> of Lyly, a kind of philosophical novel, written in an
                    affected and pedantic style, has, since the ascription to its influence by Sir
                    Walter Scott of the magniloquent bombast which he puts in the mouth of Sir
                    Piercie Shafton in the <hi rend="italic">Monastery,</hi> and considers to be
                    characteristic of the conversation of courtiers at that period, given rise to
                    the term “euphuism.” Yet it must be allowed that Sir Piercie Shafton’s talk is
                    quite a caricature of the language in <hi rend="italic">Euphues;</hi> of the
                    two, it more resembles the high-flown language that we meet with in Sidney’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Arcadia.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Mundus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alter</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Idem</hi> of Hall
                    (afterwards bishop of Norwich) is a satirical romance, written from the
                    clerico-despotic point of view, in the aim of exhibiting the debasement which
                    the principle of democracy, if carried out consistently and over a long period,
                    would, according to the author’s theory, bring upon both social and individual
                    man. One of the last and most pernicious delusions of the infatuated community
                    described in the book consists in establishing “a perpetual parliament.” Such
                    were the advisers, obeying whose fatal suggestions Charles I. reigned eleven
                    years without a parliament, and brought things to a pass whence civil war was
                    the only issue.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> of Richard Hooker, published
                    near the close of the 16th century, a solid intellectual basis, illustrated by
                    great learning and the attractions of a grave and majestic style, was for the
                    first time given to the conception of the <hi rend="italic">via media,</hi> in
                    which Anglican churchmen believed they saw a secure shelter for moderate minds,
                    midway between Rome and the extreme forms of Protestantism. The work is
                    naturally directed rather against the Puritans, who were numerous both in church
                    and state, and might eventually, as in fact they did, gain the upper hand, than
                    against the Catholics, whom the laws already silenced and disarmed. The
                    restiveness of the Puritans under the existing laws and church ordinances,
                    which, as they thought, left religion insufficiently reformed, suggested to
                    Hooker an inquiry into the nature of laws, and the grounds of their binding
                    force; this is the subject of the celebrated disquisition in the first book. The
                    Puritans were not convinced, and the struggle between them and the Anglicans
                    went on increasing iu violence, until, after the outbreak of war, the ascendency
                    of the Puritan element in the Lower House, and the secession of most of the
                    peers to Oxford, enabled its enemies temporarily to suppress the established
                    church. During the suppression, a work of great abi <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> ity, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Discourse on the Liberty of
                    Prophesying</hi> (1647), appeared from the pen of Jeremy Taylor. Fifty years
                    have made a great difference; the champion of Anglicanism no longer insists on
                    obedience, but pleads for toleration; if only the Church of England could be
                    established again in certain districts, he would be willing to see the worship
                    of many different sects, provided that they all agreed to accept the Apostles’
                    Creed as a common standard, carried on in other parts of the country. The lapse
                    of a few years restored to the church its former status without <pb break="no"

                    toleration was laid by till the Revolution.</p>
                <p>The scholastic philosophy fell, as we have seen, at the change of religion; and
                    for some time nothing took its place. When philosophical studies were revived,
                    they took a new direction, and were pursued in a new spirit. The old philosophy,
                    summing up the wisdom of Greece and that of the Christian schools, said to the
                    student, “Know God, know thyself; from this twofold knowledge learn what is
                    duty; that done, investigate at discretion either nature or the world of ideas.”
                    In practice, however, a dry logic and metaphysic, encumbered with
                    technicalities, formed the sole intellectual pabulum provided for most students
                    of philosophy. The new doctrine, introduced by Bacon, said, “Know Nature, and
                    for that purpose study thy own mind, and discover the criteria by which nature’s
                    ways may be tested; the knowledge so gained will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >power,</hi> which, well used, will enrich and adorn human life.” Mr Hallam,
                    representing the general English opinion, calls Bacon “the father of modern
                    science;” but his claim to the title is disputed both by the French and by the
                    Italians. However this may be, it is certain that he very early conceived the
                    idea of working out a new and complete system of philosophy; and to a juvenile
                    work unfolding his project in outline, which seems to have been written about
                    1584, he gave the title <hi rend="italic">Temporis</hi><hi rend="italic">Partus
                    Maximus,</hi> the greatest birth of Time. The phrase sounds arrogant, but was
                    not really so; all that Bacon meant to say was, that the new doctrine was the
                    inevitable outcome of a time now ripe for its reception,—the growth of the
                    Zeit-geist, to use a modern phrase, —and that it was impossible to overstate its
                    importance and potency. But his life was too much taken up with active labours
                    at the bar, on the bench, and in the councilchamber, to permit of his carrying
                    his vast plans into execution. All that we possess of his philosophy is
                    contained in the <hi rend="italic">Advancement of Learning</hi> (1605), the <hi
                    rend="italic">Instauratio</hi><hi rend="italic">Magna</hi> (1620), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Augmentis Scientiarum</hi> (1623). The
                    <hi rend="italic">Instauratio</hi> is a colossal programme of his philosophy in
                    six divisions, of which only the second, the “Novum Organum,” is worked out, and
                    that not completely. The “Novum Organum” was designed to be the new logic of
                    induction, which Bacon regarded as the mind’s proper instrument in utilizing the
                    fruits of experience. “Experience and observation are the guides through the
                    Baconian philosophy, which is the hand-maid and interpreter of nature.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hallam.</p></note>
                    Nevertheless the particular instrument which he invented, the method of
                    instances, is too cumbrous for practical use, and in fact never has been
                    employed in physical inquiries. “If we have not tried it," says Mr Ellis, in one
                    of his exceedingly able introductions to the works of Bacon, “it is because we
                    feel confident that it would not answer. We regard it as a curious piece of
                    machinery, very subtle, elaborate, and ingenious, but not worth constructing,
                    because all the work it could do may be done more easily another way.” It is not
                    in virtue of his method, which will not work, nor on account of special
                    contributions to any branch of physical science, for none such exist, that so
                    high a place among philosophers is assigned to Bacon by his countrymen. It is
                    rather on account of the lofty enthusiasm which animates his writings, and makes
                    him appear in them as the hierophant of Nature, eloquently pleading against the
                    neglect of her worship.</p>
                <p>The edifice of Christian philosophy lay in ruins, as we have seen, from the time
                    of the Renaissance; Bacon offered a partial substitute, designed to endow man
                    with power over nature; it was left for Hobbes, his assistant and disciple, to
                    make an attempt to occupy the whole of the ancient field of thought. He desired
                    to instruct mankind as to the origin, nature, and value of their conceptions
                    respecting God and themselves, to investigate the moral nature of man, and to
                    define the forms of guidance and of conduct best suited for a being so
                    constituted in mind and heart. His principal work was published in 1651 under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Leviathan.</hi> The fundamental principle from
                    which he starts is, that every thought which can arise in the mind of man is a
                    “representation or appearance of some quality of a body without us, which is
                    commonly called an object.” “There is no conception,” he proceeds, “in a man’s
                    mind which hath not at first, totally, or by parts, been begotten upon the
                    organs of sense. The rest are derived from that original.” The doctrine of
                    innate ideas, and every suggestion that it is possible for man to obtain real
                    knowledge otherwise than through the reports of the senses, are by this
                    preliminary tenet rejected. He proceeds, with the utmost acuteness, and a power
                    of close and sustained observation which is truly admirable, to analyse the more
                    important conceptions concerning God, time, infinity, substance, &amp;c., which
                    find a harbour within the mind. His explanations and definitions on all these
                    heads bear, as might be expected from his primary tenet, a strong materialistic
                    impress. He is also a nominalist; all objects, according to him, exist singly
                    and separately; the only universal is the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> given to a
                    number of objects which agree in certain given respects; the belief in the
                    existence of universals as <hi rend="italic">ideas</hi> he rejects, not as
                    erroneous but as absurd; nothing exists for him between, or besides, the object,
                    and the human faculties perceiving and naming it. Of the belief in a God he says
                    that “by the visible things of this world and their admirable order a man may
                    conceive there is a cause of bhem <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> which men call
                    God, and yet not have an idea or image of Him in his mind.” “As God is
                    incomprehensible, it follows that we can have no conception or image of the
                    Deity; and consequently all His attributes signify our inability or defect of
                    power to conceive anything concerning his nature, and not any conception of the
                    same, excepting only this, that there is a God.” In spite of statements of this
                    kind, which are obviously capable of being taken in a good sense, it has been
                    customary to regard Hobbes as an atheist. The cause is found in the complete
                    inadequacy of his system of morals to make good what might be wanting in his
                    speculative tenets. It is not the omissions and one-sidedness of his metaphysics
                    alone, but it is these, coupled with the perversions in his moral philosophy,
                    which have affixed to his name a reputation for atheism. The doctrine of the
                    existence of God, even attenuated to the form which we have seen above, might
                    have been sufficiently integrated by a sound doctrine respecting the human
                    conscience, the best witness for God, according to the general belief, that it
                    is in man’s power to appeal to. But when we examine Hobbes’s teaching on moral
                    matters, we find it full of paradox and absurdity. Every passion and feeling
                    which can move the human heart is, according to him, the more or less disguised
                    offspring of self-love. He scoffs at the very notion of free-will. The warnings
                    of conscience are merely the fear of something disagreeable happening to
                    ourselves, if we proceed in a particular line of conduct towards our neighbours.
                    Justice and virtue are chimeras; that is just which is commanded by the laws, or
                    which a man has covenanted to dp; that is virtuous which tends to the general
                    well-being of the community in which w e move.</p>
                <p>Hobbes’s views on civil society and government were first given to the world in
                    his <hi rend="italic">De Cive</hi> (1647); but this was afterwards incorporated
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Leviathan.</hi> The state of nature, he holds, is a
                    state of war; each man has, until he is restrained^ a natural right to take
                    everything around him for his own use; every other man has an equal right; war
                    is therefore inevitable. But men find that in the long-run <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n442/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0442-0423"/> peace conduces to their enjoyment more than war;
                    they are willing, therefore, that the natural right which each possesses should
                    be abridged, and with this end in view they enter into a covenant under which a
                    government is set up over them, charged with maintaining peace, and attending to
                    their welfare in other ways. After this has been done, the subjects cannot
                    change their government without its consent. There are three possible forms of
                    government, —monarchy, aristocracy, democracy,—in each of which the sovereign
                    power cannot be limited or divided. He appears to have thought the limited
                    monarchy of England a vicious form, which events had shown to be practically
                    untenable, the division of power between sovereign and democratic assembly
                    having led to civil war. Of the three forms he much prefers monarchy, that is,
                    absolute monarchy. He thinks it even more important that the sovereign should
                    not be hampered by any opposition on the part of the priesthood, than that he
                    should not be disturbed by the democracy. Accordingly he insists that the state
                    and the church should be the same body under different aspects, the sovereign of
                    the one being also the supreme head and ruler of the other. The sovereign, if he
                    be a Christian, is to determine what religious dogmas shall be taught by the
                    clergy, and to be the judge in the last resort on questions affecting those
                    dogmas. “This,” as Mr Hallam observes, “is not very far removed from the
                    doctrine cf Hooker, and still less from the practice of Henry VIII.”</p>
                <p>There is ample evidence that the philosophy of Hobbes exercised a baneful
                    influence on the morality of a large number of educated men in the last half of
                    the 17th century. But for his love of paradox, this influence would doubtless
                    have been still greater. In an eloquent peroration, Mr Hallam thus sums up his
                    examination of the political and ethical writings of the philosopher of
                    Malmesbury :—“The political system of Hobbes, like his moral system, of which,
                    in fact, it is only a portion, sears up the heart. It takes away the sense of
                    wrong, that has consoled the wise and good in their dangers, the proud appeal of
                    innocence under oppression, like that of Prometheus to the elements, uttered to
                    the witnessing world, to the coming ages, to the just ear of heaven. It
                    confounds the principles of moral approbation, the notions of good and ill
                    desert, in a servile idolatry of the monstrous leviathan it creates, and after
                    sacrificing all right at the altar of power, denies to the Omnipotent the
                    prerogative of dictating the laws of His own worship.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Reaction and Counter-Action,</hi> 1G60-1700.—At the
                    Restoration, the king and his personal friends, who had lived abroad during the
                    Commonwealth and Protectorate, brought to England a sense of fitness in things
                    literary, and an aversion to what was grotesque and exaggerated in style, which
                    they had picked up in the polished society of the French salons. In poetry,
                    perhaps, no reform was needed. The prevalence of good taste and good sense,
                    assisted by the example of Milton, who in his juvenile poems scorned to use the
                    “new-fangled toys” of the fantastic poets, had already condemned the school
                    which delighted in “conceits.” There is a purity of form in the odes of Waller,
                    in the works of Denham, and even in much that in his later years came from the
                    pen of Cowley, which prevented exception being taken to them on the score of
                    refinement. With regard to prose style and the drama the case was different.
                    When men looked back for twenty years and more to the theatre as it was before
                    the troubles, and remembered the plays of Jonson and Shirley, they felt that
                    there was much need of a change. The gay young <hi rend="italic">roué</hi> of
                    Jonson’s plays is a coarse, brutal, and insupportable personage; his “clenches”
                    and sallies are not wit, but the noisy outcome of a superficial cleverness,
                    aided by a flow of animal spirits. The easy badinage and well-managed <hi
                    rend="italic">double entendre</hi> of the French comic stage were new phenomena,
                    of which that of England had never had the least conception. Nor, in tragedy,
                    was there any inclination to return to the piled up agony—“horror on horror’s
                    head ”—of the plots of Ford and Fletcher. Corneille had shown that the
                    sentiments of honour and levé in their chivalrous intensity, when exhibited as
                    in conflict with the harsh demands of circumstance and the world, are capable of
                    producing the finest tragic situations. Dryden’s heroic plays (7‰ <hi
                    rend="italic">Indian Emperor, The Conquest of Granada,</hi> &lt;fcc.) were up to
                    a certain point imitations of Corneille; the extent to which they are
                    sensational and crowded with incident was a feature taken from the theatre of
                    Spain. The verse is rhymed in imitation of his French models; and in more than
                    one of his prefaces or essays Dryden ably urged the claims of “his long loved
                    mistress, Rhyme,” as an indispensable decoration without which the requisite
                    weight and dignity of the tragic style could not be attained. In the article on
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama</hi> (vol. vii. p. 434), notice has been taken of
                    the chief works, both in tragedy and comedy, produced by our dramatists between
                    the Restoration and the end of the century. Dryden, whose power and insight grew
                    with advancing age, recognized, after devoting himself to the heroic style for
                    years, the superiority of Shakespeare, abandoned rhyme, and produced in 1690 his
                    finest play <hi rend="italic">Don Sebastian.</hi> But it was then too late to
                    arrest the decay of the drama. The Dutch king who then sat on the Stuart throne,
                    the Dutch army which had placed him there, the exultation of the Whigs and the
                    dissenters, were all so many indications that the Teutonic element in the
                    English mind was again in the ascendant. And the ascendency of the Teutonic
                    element, then still more than in previous ages, on account of the gulf which had
                    been established between the Teutonic and Latin races by the Reformation,
                    implied the predominance of an energy which preferred strength to grace, the
                    useful to the beautiful, industry to art. All these impulses were of course only
                    confirmed by the religious and moral views which are grouped under the general
                    name of Puritanism. The drama, therefore, being in opposition to the prevailing
                    spirit, fell ever lower and lower; and though momentarily uplifted, in later
                    times, by the genius of a Goldsmith or a Sheridan, it has never regained its
                    hold upon the nation. A modern critic has compared our drama, commencing with
                    the Elizabethan age and ending with the present day, to a huge pyramid which
                    stands on a broad and magnificent base, dwindles continually, and ends in
                    nothing. Even at this day, there is still too much of the Puritan temper in
                    general society to admit of the success of any proposal in parliament tending to
                    the encouragement and support of the drama by the state, as a department of
                    national culture.</p>
                <p>The prose style of the French writers was, at the time of the Restoration, much
                    superior to ours. We had no one to oppose to Segrais, Fontenelle, Balzac,
                    Voiture, Menage, and Bouhours, to select only the principal names among the
                    French critics and <hi rend="italic">beaux esprits.</hi> Nor was this
                    superiority of our neighbours sensibly dimiuished till the next century, when
                    Addison, Steele, and Swift redressed the balance. Yet it must be conceded to
                    Dryden that the prose of his numerous essays, prefaces, and dedications,
                    prefixed or subjoined to his published plays (especially the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on Dramatic Poesy},</hi> is incomparably more polished and more effective
                    than any of the rude attempts at criticism which our writers had hitherto
                    attempted. There is, however, a certain wildness clinging to Dryden’s style, in
                    spite of his efforts to improve it, and in spite of his wit and the promptitude
                    of his vivacious intellect: one never feels quite secure against the occurrence
                    of a solecism. Hobbes’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n443/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0443-0424"/> style is more unexceptionable; he had resided
                    much in France, and consorted with French <hi rend="italic">literati,</hi> and
                    thus learned the charm of a perfectly clear and simple way of writing. Among the
                    divines of this age there was much eloquence, much richness and force, but
                    little good style. Nothing can be more copious than Taylor, but it is a <hi
                    rend="italic">«toying</hi> manner; his facility of speech and coining
                    imagination are masters of him, not he of them. Isaac Bar row, who died in his
                    forty-seventh year iu 1677, seems to be the best of them; he has more
                    self-command than Taylor, more earnestness than South, and more dignity than
                    Baxter. Against Tillotson’s style no particular objection can be urged, except
                    that it does not prevent his <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> from being dull and
                    dry.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi> of Jobu Bunyan (1684) the style,
                    without being elevated or distinguished, is plain and manly. It is of course
                    free from pedantry, which cannot be where there is no learning; but it is also
                    free from affectations, and—almost always—from vulgarity. It is interesting to
                    observe in this,—the most popular English work of the century,—the revival of
                    Hie old allegorical way of writing which was so much relished in the age of
                    Chaucer. Mr Hallam remarks that there is some inconsistency or defectiveness of
                    plan; the persecution of the pilgrims iu the city of Vanity, and the adventure
                    of the cave and the two giants, might with equal propriety, so far as the
                    allegorical meaning is concerned, have been placed at any other stage of the
                    pilgrimage. This is true; but it is only saying that in these passages the tale
                    overpowers the allegory; considered as incidents iu the tale, they could not
                    have been better placed than where they are.</p>
                <p>In the heyday of reaction against the hypocrisy and violence of the Puritans, it
                    may be imagined that neither they nor their principles found any quarter. A long
                    satire in doggerel verse, the <hi rend="italic">Hudibrαs</hi> of Samuel Butler,
                    one of the best second-rate poets of the day, was especially devoted to their
                    discomfiture. The general texture of this poem is loose and careless; ⅛he
                    versification, as a rule, too unpolished to invite to a second reading; still
                    there are epigrammatic couplets and sarcastic descriptions in it which will be
                    remembered while English literature endures. Denham, best known as the author of
                    the pretty descriptive poem of <hi rend="italic">Coopers Hill,</hi> wrote many
                    pieces in the spirit of the reaction, which in him, as in Davenant and others,
                    went to the length of identifying Puritanism with Christianity, and rejecting
                    both together. Such at least seems the natural conclusion to be drawn from a
                    perusal of Denham’s strange poem entitled <hi rend="italic">The Progress of
                    Learning.</hi> In Dryden’s poetry the temper and policy of reaction are
                    exhibited with great distinctness. At first, and for many years after the
                    Restoration, his attacks are chiefly upon the political side of Puritanism; he
                    rings the changes on “rebellion,” “faction,” “disobedience,” and “anarchy.” In
                    <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitofhel</hi> (1681) he argues, with that skill
                    of ratiocination in metre which never forsakes him, against the tenets of
                    democracy and the absolute right of a majority :—</p>
                <p>“Nor is the people's judgment always true;</p>
                <p>The most may err as grossly as the few.”</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Threnodia</hi><hi rend="italic">Augustalis</hi> he talks of
                    “senates insolently loud;” and in the <hi rend="italic">Hind and Panther</hi>
                    (1687) cleverly presses home against the clergy, who were grumbling at the
                    arbitrary acts of James IL, their own declared principles of “passive obedience”
                    and “submission for conscience’ sake.” In middle life Dryden began to take a
                    lively interest in the controversy on the grounds of religious belief; we see
                    him in the <hi rend="italic">Religio</hi><hi rend="italic">Laici</hi> (1681)
                    perplexing himself with the endeavour to ascertain the limits of the province of
                    authority and that of private judgment. Waiving the question as to the entire
                    sincerity, or rather disinterestedness, of his conversion, we find him, after
                    that event, ex emplifying the reaction against Puritanism in an extreme degree;
                    as he had magnified the authority of the prince in the political sphere, so now
                    he magnifies the authority of the church in the religious sphere. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Hind and Panther,</hi> as all the world knows, is a
                    theologico-political dialogue, disguised under a thin, a very thin veil of
                    allegory, on some of the questions debated between the churches of Rome and
                    England, and also on some of the political theories then in vogue.</p>
                <p>As for the drama, the mere fact of its revival was a part of the reaction against
                    Puritanism. In the coarse play of <hi rend="italic">The Roundheads, or the Good
                    Old Cause,</hi> by Mrs Aphra Behn, which came out shortly after the Restoration,
                    some of the great Commonwealthsmen are exhibited on the stage, of course in an
                    odious light. Dryden kept clear, in his dramas, of scurrilities of this kind,
                    probably because he himself had been brought up among Puritans. In the famous
                    play of <hi rend="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</hi> (1685) by Crowne, the character
                    of the Whig-Puritan, Mr Testimony, is a compound of hypocrisy, knavery, and
                    cowardice. Yet at the time when this play was represented, the party of the
                    counter-action, represented now by the names of Whig and dissenter, was already
                    so strong that Crowne could say of them in his dedication to the duke of
                    Ormond,—“There were no living, if some great men, elevated not only in quality
                    but understanding above the rest of the world, did not protect us [the
                    dramatists] from those barbarians, because they know us.” After the Revolution
                    there was a truce; the comedies of Congreve and Wycherley have no political
                    bearing. The comic stage was hardly, if at all, employed for party purposes till
                    the reign of Queen Anne, when the strong high-church temper which prevailed in
                    the country caused the revival of <hi rend="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</hi>
                    (1711). A few years later Cibber, in his play of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nonjuror,</hi> imitated from Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Tartufe,</hi> attacked
                    the nonjurors and the Catholics in the interest of the Hanoverian succession. As
                    altered by Bickersteth, the same play appeared soon afterwards with the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Hypocrite;</hi> here dissentis attacked in the persons of
                    Dr Cantwell and Mawworm.</p>
                <p>In political philosophy the reactionary spirit was represented by Sir Robert
                    Filmer, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Patriarcha</hi> (1680), argued that
                    legitimate kings inherited the absolute power over their subjects, which he
                    assumed Adam and the patriarchs to have possessed and exercised over their
                    families. This doctrine was opposed by the republican Algernon Sidney, and also
                    by Locke, whose admirable <hi rend="italic">Treatises on Government</hi>
                    appeared in 1688. Though not indisposed to admit that the monarchical
                    constitution of existing kingdoms was originally <hi rend="italic">imitated</hi>
                    from the patriarchal rule, which in the infancy of society is known to have
                    existed, nay, which still exists in families and clans, Locke denied that this
                    imitation implied any devolution of right or power; the origin of civil right he
                    sought, like Hooker, in a contract, expressed or implied, between the governors
                    and the governed, which bound the one to govern on certain prescribed terms,
                    that is, according to law, and the other to obey the lawful commands of the
                    government. It is well known that this doctrine of an original contract found
                    its way into that celebrated state-paper, the Declaration of Rights, in which it
                    is asserted that James II. had “endeavoured to subvert the constitution of this
                    kingdom, <hi rend="italic">by breaking the original contract between king and
                    people."</hi></p>
                <p>In other departments of literature, as well as political philosophy, the
                    counter-action strongly asserted itself. Milton, “on evil tongues though fallen,
                    and evil times,” knew that he should “fit audience find, though few,” when at
                    the close of life he gave his long-promised service to the epic muse, and sang
                    “an elaborate song to generations.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0444-0425"/> The <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> is
                    indisputably the work of a great and lofty mind,—of a mind armed by nature with
                    an astonishing moral energy, and equipped with powers of imagination and
                    conception suitable to the charge of a vast enterprise. This is the more
                    apparent, because the diction of tbe poem certainly falls below the standard of
                    purity and evenness which the best writers of the day had reached, while the
                    peculiar nature of his subject involved Milton in the greatest difficulties. A
                    number of awkward and ill-sounding words, the use of which would fix the note of
                    pedantry on any one else than Milton, were formed by him from the Latin, and
                    freely employed in the <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost;</hi> how injudiciously,
                    the mere fact that not one of them has held its ground and come into common use
                    is sufficient to prove. The subject,—belonging neither to history nor legend, so
                    that details could not be supplied by tradition, and could only be invented at
                    the imminent risk of profaneness,—was baffling by its very grandeur and
                    simplicity. It did not in itself present a sufficiency of changes and incidents
                    to furnish out the material of a long epic composition; hence Milton was obliged
                    to have recourse to episodes, with which nearly half the poem is taken up. It is
                    noteworthy how weighty and dignified a rhythm blank verse becomes in his hands.
                    Never, as used by him, does it even tend to be the dull, insignificant, tiresome
                    metre which it was in the hands of later writers, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Thomson, Young, and even Wordsworth, in their negligent hours. Milton, in whose
                    eyes the Cavaliers of the Restoration were—</p>
                <p>“The sons</p>
                <p>Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine,”</p>
                <p>neither wished nor expected to be read at court. Forty years later, when
                    counter-action had accomplished the Revolution, and Whiggism had secured much of
                    the ground from which its parent Puritanism had been contemptuously thrust back,
                    Whig critics like Addison found no difficulty in gaining a hearing, when they
                    pressed upon general society the consideration of the surpassing claims of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> to the admiration of Englishmen.</p>
                <p>In the department of history, the reaction produced, in Clarendon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Rebellion,</hi> a masterly and enduring work. The
                    writers of the counter-action were also busy in this field; and Burnet’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Reformation</hi> (1679) was thought to lend so much
                    support to Protestant and liberal principles that he received the thanks of the
                    House of Commons for writing it.</p>
                <p>The materialistic empiricism of Hobbes gave place in this period to what has been
                    called the sensistic empiricism, or sensationalism, of Locke. Inasmuch as this
                    philosopher struck two important blows at principles which the Whig-Puritans
                    detested,—at the principle of authority, by deriving all human knowledge from
                    experience, and at the doctrine which ascribes reality both to the accidents, or
                    sensible qualities, of objects, and to the substances in which they are supposed
                    to inhere, by (with Descartes) awarding mere subjectivity to accidents, and
                    relegating substance to the region of the unknowable,—he may properly be
                    regarded as the philosopher of the counter-action.</p>
                <p>The first book of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Human Understanding</hi>
                    (1689) is devoted to the endeavour to disprove the doctrine of innate ideas.
                    Yet, when we proceed to examine Locke’s own view of the origin of our knowledge,
                    it would appear at first sight that he admits one source which is independent of
                    the reports of sense. Our knowledge, he says, is made up partly of ideas of
                    sensation, partly of ideas of reflection. These last are supplied to the mind by
                    its own operations; we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that we think, believe,
                    doubt, will, love, &lt;fcc. Now, if these operations were assumed to have any
                    other basis than sensible experience, ideas of reflection might be a source of
                    knowledge independent of the senses. But as his argument proceeds, it is evident
                    that Locke had no such meaning. All such mental operations, in his view, are
                    dependent on the mind’s having previously been supplied with ideas by the
                    senses. “In time the mind comes to reflect on its own operations about the ideas
                    got by sensation, and thereby stores itself with a new set of ideas, which I
                    call ideas of reflection.” This and many similar passages are decisive as to
                    Locke’s belief, that there is but one original gate of ideas, viz., the senses.
                    The mind at birth is a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa,</hi> or, to use his own
                    illustration, a “sheet of white paper;” whatever knowledge it afterwards
                    acquires is written on it by the finger of experience. This denial of <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> knowledge w as not effectually confuted till the
                    rise of Kant, near the close of the 18th century. It followed from Locke’s
                    principles that belief in revealed religion (which in his case was perfectly
                    sincere) was simply and entirely a question of external evidence. If the
                    evidence for the truth of the alleged fact or doctrine appeared sufficient, the
                    mind would accept it; if not, reject it; but no principle inherent in its own
                    constitution could be appealed to in either case to aid its judgment; for on
                    Locke’s system no such principles existed.</p>

                    Dryden had descended into the tomb; aud his mantle had fallen on no poet.
                    Grateful for support manfully rendered when all the w orld was against him, he
                    had, in some moving and musical lines, designated in Congreve the successor to
                    his fame —</p>
                <p>“Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue,</p>
                <p>But shade those laurels which descend to you :”</p>
                <p>but that cold man of fashion never rose above the point which he had reached in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mourning Bride.</hi> A poet, however, appeared before
                    long, but he was a Whig poet; that is, he represented respectability,
                    common-sense, and the <hi rend="italic">juste milieu;</hi> —the cause which
                    fires the blood, the ideal which kindles the imagination, were strange to him.
                    This was Addison, whose <hi rend="italic">Campaign</hi> (1704), an heroic poem
                    on the battle of Blenheim, is much in the style of that portion of Dryden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Aηrnιs</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirabilis</hi> which describes the
                    duke of York’s victory over the Dutch fleet, but is written with more care and
                    more concentration. To the production of <hi rend="italic">Cato,</hi> a tragedy
                    which observes the rules, and aims at exhibiting the lofty grandeur and the
                    devotion to principle of the Roman character, Addison seems to have been induced
                    partly by his protracted stay in Italy (where his attention was engrossed by
                    classical monuments, and turned with indifference from mediaeval), partly by the
                    desire to win laurels in the field where Corneille and Racine bad shone with
                    such distinction, and to show that an English dramatist could be as <hi
                    rend="italic">correct</hi> as they. No other poem of note, with the single
                    exception to which we shall presently refer, was written in the reign of Anne.

                    written rather to give vent to his spleen, and exercise his misanthropic humour,
                    than under the presence of any motive which ordinarily influences poets. Parnell
                    wrote one or two didactic pieces, and Rowe some pastoral ballads, which are not
                    w ithout merit. Defoe’s satirical poems, <hi rend="italic">The True-Born
                    Englishman</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ode to the Pillory,</hi> possess the
                    interest which the indomitable character and caustic humour of the man impart to
                    them. As a dissenter, he felt properly grateful to the Dutch prince, one of the
                    first acts of whose reign was to establish a legal toleration, and was equally
                    indignant with the clergymen and gentlemen of England, who, though glad to be
                    rid of James IL, felt sore at the thought that the Revolution was effected by
                    foreign regiments. This feeling led to a temporary insistance in society on the
                    fact that a man was <hi rend="italic">an Englishman born;</hi> and it is this
                    insistance w hich Defoe assails with homely but effective ridicule in the <hi

                    his public exposure in that “state machine” for having written <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Shortest Way with the Hissenters.</hi> This was an ironical pamphlet,
                    occasioned by the disgust with which Defoe was inspired by the conduct of the
                    wealthy dissenters in London, who occasionally conformed to the worship of the
                    establishment in order to qualify themselves under the Test Act for holding
                    office. Defoe recommends the passing of an Act by which a dissenter attending a
                    conventicle shall be made punishable by death or imprisonment for life. Many of
                    the clergy took the pamphlet seriously, and approved of it; when it was
                    discovered that the advice was ironical, the exasperation against Defoe was so
                    great that it resulted in his being condemned to pay a heavy fine and to stand
                    in the pillory. The <hi rend="italic">Ode</hi> has a nervous strength, almost
                    dignity, of style, which cau seldom be asserted of the writings of Defoe.
                    Referring to this incident, Pope, whose Catholic rearing made him detest the
                    abettor of the Revolution and the champion of William of Orange, wrote in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hunciad—</hi></p>
                <p>“Earless on high stands unabash'd Defoe”—</p>
                <p>though he knew that the sentence to the pillory had long ceased to entail the
                    loss of ears.</p>
                <p>The exceptionally remarkable poem to which reference was made in the last
                    paragraph was Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism,</hi> which appeared
                    in 1711. Of all such poems the <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi> of Horace is
                    the original model—a model, it may be added, which has never been surpassed. The
                    classical taste, and the desire to conform to the ancient rules, which had
                    obtained a complete ascendency in the literary circles of France during the
                    reign of Louis XIV., were now almost equally prevalent in England. Boileau’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Épître sur l’Art Poétique,</hi> and the critical writings of
                    Bossu, Bouhours, Dacier, and Sarasin, led to the appearance in England of such
                    works as Roscommon’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Translated Verse,</hi>
                    Sheffield’s two <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> on satire and on poetry, and the
                    critical attempts, in prose, of Rymer and Dennis. The receptivity and power of
                    Pope’s intellect were naturally employed at an early period of his career on a
                    line of thought, in literature and art, which interested so many able minds, and
                    was, so to speak, in the air. He lays down in the <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>
                    rules for the guidance of critics in judging, which, he contends, they are as
                    much bound to observe as poets are to follow the rules of art in writing. The
                    acuteness of observation, the terseness of definition, the brilliance of wit,
                    and the keenness of polished invective which distinguish the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay,</hi> render it, though containing little that is absolutely new, a
                    composition of which English literature may well be proud.</p>
                <p>But the chief literary achievements of this period were expressed in prose. Prose
                    is the medium which befits the <hi rend="italic">seculum rationalisticum</hi>
                    which is now opening, an age in which men do not trouble themselves about new
                    ideas, but reason and debate upon those which have been already manifested.
                    Ideas possess themselves of the whole man, and impel him to remodel his life in
                    accordance with them. The idea of the theocratic republic, growing into distinct
                    shape in the minds of Milton, Cromwell, and other Puritans, drove them to march
                    through war, regicide, and revolution towards its accomplishment. The idea of
                    hereditary monarchy, ruling by virtue of a right of which the origin is lost in
                    the mists of a venerable antiquity, and is therefore assumed to be divine,
                    animated the Jacobites of 1700, as it animates the French legitimists of our own
                    day. But neither of these two ideas had, after turning England upside down,
                    succeeded in establishing itself; the country had acquiesced perforce in a
                    compromise. The partisans of the theocratic republic were forced to put up with
                    king, constitution, law, and an Erastian church; nevertheless they were
                    tolerated, and even allowed to write and preach what they pleased, so long as
                    they did not openly advocate sedition. The partisans of hereditary monarchy were
                    forced to accept a king, and then a queen, and then a whole dynasty, whose
                    rights had no older or more sacred origin than the Acts of Settlement of 1689
                    and 1701; still some deference was paid to their cherished sentiments, inasmuch
                    as the new stock of royalty was not sought from an alien tree, but was a scion,
                    though not the legitimate scion, growing from the old Stuart trunk. With this
                    makeshift English loyalty was fain to be content. Thus on both sides the
                    consistent theorists, the men of an idea, were discountenanced; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">via media</hi> in politics and religion, since it seemed to be the
                    only practicable path, was more and more frequented by men of sense. Then a host
                    of reasoners and debaters arose, bent upon showing, not that the compromises
                    were logically sound, which they could not do, but that the extremists were
                    dangerous fools. Moreover, since the compromise might be held and viewed from
                    opposite sides, endless debate was possible, and actually arose, as to the right
                    way of viewing it, whether mainly as a concession to liberty and democracy, or
                    mainly as the guarantee of order and conservatism. In contests of this kind the
                    pens of many able writers were engaged in the reign of Anne; we may mention in
                    particular Swift, Steele, Addison, and Arbuthnot. We will briefly examine their
                    chief performances, first in general literature and then in theology and
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>Swift, appointed to the deanery of St Patrick’s in 1713, was generally believed
                    to have no faith in revealed religion, but to adhere to what we have called “the
                    compromise” for the sake of what he could get by it. On the night before his
                    installation, a copy of verses was affixed to the door of St Patrick’s
                    cathedral, containing these amongst other lines :—</p>
                <p>“This place he got by wit and rhyme,</p>
                <p>And other ways most odd;</p>
                <p>And might a bishop be,—in time,</p>
                <p>Did he believe in God.”</p>
                <p>“Look down, St Patrick, look, we pray, On this thy church and steeple;</p>
                <p>Convert thy dean on this great day, Or else, God help the people.”</p>
                <p>This reputation for unbelief was acquired through the publication of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tale of a Tub</hi> (1704), in which Swift employed the
                    unequalled resources of his scornful wit in satirizing the extreme parties, the
                    consistent doctrines, which the Revolution had discomfited. In the celebrated
                    apologue of Peter, Martin, and Jack (by whom we may either understand
                    Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism, or the Church of Rome, that of England,
                    and the Puritans), it is hard to say whether the assault on Peter’s knavery and
                    mendacity, or on Jack’s fanatical folly, be the∣more unsparing. Of Martin, who
                    represents rational religion, moderation, common-sense,—in a word, the
                    compromise,—· Swift has only expressions of approval. But we know that what men
                    <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> to be a compromise, they cannot heartily love; and
                    it is therefore only in conformity with what we should expect, to find that for
                    every page given to the commendation of Martin, at least twenty are employed in
                    reviling Peter or ridiculing Jack. Hence the general effect of the work as a
                    whole is that of an attack on Christianity; and on this account its perusal was
                    much recommended by Voltaire.</p>
                <p>But there were other upholders of “the compromise” who had nothing of Swift’s
                    cynical temper, nay, who were conspicuously warm-hearted, eager, and generous.
                    Such a man was the Irishman Richard Steele. He seems to have ∣ been descended
                    from one of those Cromwellian adventurers who were rewarded for their services
                    to the Puritan <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n446/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0446-0427"/> commonwealth by grants of land at the expense of
                    the Irish. It was natural, therefore, that his political sympathies should be of
                    an Orange hue, and that he should regard William III. as the greatest of
                    deliverers, the most beneficent of conquerors. For, but for the battle of the
                    Boyne, it cannot be doubted that the confiscations of previous reigns would have
                    been in great measure reversed, and the native Irish resettled on their own
                    soil; in which case families of English origin and of recent importation, like
                    that of Steele, would have fared but badly. Hence in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christian Hero</hi> (1701), written while he was in the array, and again in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Taller,</hi> Steele launches forth into glowing panegyrics on
                    his Dutch hero, which would have satisfied Lord Macaulay himself. The
                    foundations being secure, Steele, whose education was English (he was at the
                    Charterhouse and at Oxford along with Addison), employed hi3 voluble
                    argumentative tongue and his racy Hibernian humour to improve the
                    superstructure. Mild reasoning, gentle ridicule, harmless banter, might, he
                    thought, be used with effect to assuage the rancour of old animosities, soften
                    the asperity of party spirit, expose the weak side of vanity, and introduce a
                    temper of “sweet reasonableness” into all social relations. Availing himself of
                    the advantages which his position as conductor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Government Gazette</hi> gave him for obtaining early news, Steele started the
                    <hi rend="italic">Taller</hi> in 1709, with the view of entertaining with
                    instructive and amusing gossip the readers whom the promise of news from the
                    seat of war had already attracted. The imaginary editor, Isaac Bickerstaff (the
                    name was borrowed from Swift, who had employed it in his ironical controversy
                    with Partridge the almanac-maker), dates his communications from various
                    coffee-houses according to their subject matter. Addison, who was at the time in
                    Ireland, soon discovered the authorship of the <hi rend="italic">Taller,</hi>
                    and was enlisted with joy by Steele as a contributor. It was succeeded by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> (1711-1713), planned by the two friends in
                    concert, with the same general objects as the <hi rend="italic">Taller ,</hi>
                    but with better machinery. Almost at the opening, in No. 3, Addison wrote a
                    clever vindication of the revolution-compromise, which the Jacobite leanings of
                    some among the ministry appeared at the time to place in jeopardy. With this
                    exception, political questions are scarcely mentioned by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator,</hi> who in his character of a mild censor of manners, “pietate
                    gravis ac meritis,” affects to stand aloof from the strife of party, and by
                    expostulation and advice, undertakes to reform society. “The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taller</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> were published,” says Dr
                    Johnson, “at a time when two parties, loud, restless, and violent, each with
                    plausible declarations, and each perhaps without any distinct termination of its
                    views, were agitating the nation; to minds heated with political contest they
                    supplied cooler and more inoffensive reflexions: and it is said by Addison that
                    they had a perceptible influence upon the conversation of that time, and taught
                    the frolic and the gay to unite merriment with decency.”</p>
                <p>By turning to fresh intellectual fields the minds of the upper classes—the people
                    in good society—to whom the theatre was now a forbidden or despised excitement,
                    Addison and Steele did without doubt allay much restlessness, still or amuse
                    many feverish longings. Its ideals discredited or found impracticable, the
                    English mind, disenchanted and in heavy cheer, took up with languid interest
                    these pleasant chatty discoursings about things in general, and allowed itself
                    to be amused, and half forgot its spiritual perplexities. Nothing was settled by
                    these papers, nothing really probed to the bottom; but they taught, with much
                    light grace and humour, lessons of good sense and mutual tolerance; and their
                    popularity proved that the lesson was relished. The characterization which we
                    meet with in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> has been justly admired. Sir
                    Roger de Coverley is an excellent type of the English country gentleman of that
                    day—unintelligent and full of prejudices, but manly, open-hearted, and
                    conscientious. The mercantile classes are represented, less adequately, yet in a
                    dignified and attractive manner, by Sir Andrew Freeport. Captain Sentry, as the
                    representative of the army, is not so satisfactory; compare him with Uncle Toby
                    and Corporal Trim in Sterne’s <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> and the
                    contrast between a dull, wooden figure, and personages who bring the life of the
                    British army in Flanders exactly and vividly before our eyes, is immediately
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>The theological controversies of the period were carried on chiefly between
                    deists and churchmen on the one hand, and non jurors and oath-takers on the
                    other. There will always be able men to whom revealed religion will not commend
                    itself, because demonstration of its truth is in the nature of things
                    impossible, and the portal through which conviction must be reached is too lowly
                    for many to enter. In this age of reasoning, the English writers who followed
                    Hobbes in eliminating the supernatural from Christianity considered it tobe
                    their duty to exhibit their proofs in the clearest and most systematic manner.
                    Thus arose the school of English deists. Toland, the author of a good life of
                    Milton, led the way with <hi rend="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</hi>
                    (1702). Tindal followed with <hi rend="italic">Christianity as Old as the
                    Creation,</hi> in which an attempt is made to identify Christ with Crishna, and
                    to evaporate the Christian religion into a solar myth. Collins, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourse on Free-Thinking,</hi> took the line of impugning the
                    trustworthiness of the text of Scripture. He was answered by Dr Richard Bentley
                    in a tract called <hi rend="italic">Phileleutherus Lipsieηsis,</hi> in which it
                    is maintained that the text of the Greek Testament is on the whole in a sounder
                    state than that of any of the Greek classical authors. Berkeley combated
                    free-thinking in the philosophical dialogue of <hi rend="italic">Alciphron.</hi>
                    Bishop Butler, and afterwards Warburton, contributed important works to the same
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>In philosophy the trains of thought which Hobbes and Leibnitz had pursued were
                    either further developed, or led to opposing reactions. Hobbes’s selfish theory
                    of morals, and his disposition to leave out the idea of God from his system of
                    the universe, found resolute opponents, not only in Clarke and Berkeley, but
                    also in Shaftesbury, the noble author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics.</hi> The treatises composing this work were published at
                    various times between 1708 and 1713. Shaftesbury maintains the disinterested
                    theory of; morals, but rather in a rhetorical way than with much solidity of
                    argument. he derives virtue, beneficence, and compassion, not, as Hobbes had in
                    each case done, from a source tainted by self interest, but from the delight
                    which the mind naturally takes in actions and feelings conformable to its own
                    unperverted nature. In his general reasonings on the constitution of nature and
                    of man, Shaftesbury is an optimist; but his optimism acquires its serenity at
                    the cost of surrendering the distinction between good and evil, virtue and vice.
                    Like Pope (who, indeed, in the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man,</hi> versified
                    and condensed freely the glowing rhetoric of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics),</hi> Shaftesbury</p>
                <p>“Accounts for moral as for natural things the Deity whom he celebrates in
                    eloquent periods is not a being who hates moral evil while permitting it, but
                    one from whose elevated point of view that which seems to us worthy of
                    reprobation must appear as necessary to the working out of a vast scheme of
                    paternal government. These views bear a considerable resemblance to the
                    hypothesis more cautiously put forward by the late Professor Mansel,&gt; and at
                    once combated by Mr Mill and Professor Goldwin Smith, which suggested that man’s
                    ideas of justice and injustice, right and wrong, were perhaps<pb break="no"

                    existed in the mind of God. It is obvious that the Supreme Being of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Characteristics,</hi> in whose eyes the excesses of the Reign of
                    Terror would be merely a hurricane purifying the moral atmosphere, and who would
                    see “with equal eye”</p>
                <p>“A heιo perish or a sparrow fall ”—</p>
                <p>has little in common with the God of the New Testament, whose absolute rejection
                    of iniquity is the very basis on which revealed religion is built, and in whose
                    eyes the least of his reasonable creatures is “of more value than many
                    sparrows.” This dissonance between Christianity and his own system was evident
                    to Shaftesbury himself, and led him to speak disrespectfully of the former in
                    various places of his writings. He is accordingly classed by Leland among
                    deistical writers. Pope, less clearsighted, would not admit that the philosophy
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> (which is precisely the same as that
                    of Shaftesbury) was in any way repugnant to Christianity; and Warburton argued
                    laboriously on the same side. Nevertheless, in his <hi rend="italic">Universal
                    Prayer,</hi> Pope implicitly retracted the main tenet of the longer poem; and
                    posterity has held that Crousaz, the assailant of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay,</hi> understood its real bearing better than Warburton its defender</p>
                <p>Disturbed at the thought of the predominance which the spread of Locke’s
                    sensationalist philosophy might be expected to give to the material interests of
                    man, yet not choosing to revert to any of the old systems which let in the
                    principle of authority, Berkeley conceived the strange idea of denying the
                    validity of the inferences made by every perceiving mind concerning the objects
                    perceived. He denied the existence of matter, or material substance, which is
                    merely the name given by philosophers to the “something” which underlies and
                    supports the sensible qualities of an object. The objects themselves, he
                    admitted, are real; the ideas which the mind forms concerning them are also
                    real; moreover, these ideas constitute for man the sole road to the knowledge of
                    the objects. Instead of holding with Locke that the objecte, by the impressions
                    which they make on the senses, engender ideas, he held that the ideas implanted
                    by the Creator in the human mind teach it all that it can possibly know about
                    the objects. This ideal philosophy, having a merely subjective base—growing
                    neither out of tradition nor experience—might obviously be twisted to the
                    vindication of any system of opinions whatever. Hume, therefore, as we shall see
                    in the next section, had not much difficulty in reducing it <hi rend="italic">ad

                    started.</p>
                <p>In France and Spain, Lesage and Lazarillo de Tonnes had already won laurels by
                    writing humorous tales of fiction in prose. Defoe, with us, was the first of a
                    series in which he has had so many brilliant successors, by composing <hi
                    rend="italic">Pobinson Crusoe</hi> (1719). Many other fictitious tales, in all
                    which he aimed at the appearance of being a truthful narrator of facts, followed
                    from the same facile pen. But in the texture of these, as in the mind that
                    produced them, there was something coarse and homely; they could not supplant
                    for refined rêaders the high flown romances of Franco. That was reserved for the
                    sentimental novels of Richardson; <hi rend="italic">similia similibus

                <p>IX. <hi rend="italic">The Triumph of Compromise,</hi> 1729-1789.—In the early
                    part of this period, Pope, who died in 1744, was still the great literary force;
                    for most of the remainder of it, that honour belonged to Samuel Johnson. Nothing
                    can more strongly demonstrate the vitality of the political principles which
                    triumphed at the Revolution than the fact that both these great men, though in
                    secret they abhorred the compromise, had no choice but to acquiesce in it. Pope,
                    whose grounds of dislike were both religious and political, indemnified himself
                    for his acquiescence by many a scornful gibe and bitter sarcasm levelled at the
                    German family which had seated itself on the Stuart throne. Witness the mocking
                    adulation of the opening lines of the epistle to Augustus (George IT ), or the
                    scathing satire with which he pursued the memory of Queen Caroline both in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Epilogue to the
                    Satires,</hi> though he knew, and even admitted in a note, that that princess in
                    her last moments “manifested the utmost courage and resolution.” Johnson, whose
                    objection to the compromise was almost wholly political, was an arrant Jacobite
                    in feeling to the end of his days. One of his earliest productions, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marmor</hi><hi rend="italic">Norfolciense,</hi> is a clever and
                    cutting Jacobite squib. Allusions in his satire of <hi rend="italic">London</hi>
                    (1738) show the same political colour, and probably had much to do with the
                    sympathizing approval which Pope expressed for the unknown poet, who, he said,
                    would soon be <hi rend="italic">deterre.</hi> And although, after he had
                    accepted a pension from George III., he could not decently, as he smilingly
                    admitted to Boswell, “drink King James’s health in the wine that King George
                    gave him the money to pay for,” yet the old feeling lurked in his mind, and
                    found violent expression in a recorded conversation as late as 1777. “He had
                    this evening a violent argument with Dr Taylor as to the inclinations of the
                    people of England at this time towards the royal family of Stuart. He grew so
                    outrageous as to say that, ‘ if England were fairly polled, the present king
                    would be sent away to-night, and his adherents hanged to-morrow.'”</p>
                <p>But, in general, the compromise met with inward no less than outward assent on
                    the part of all the leading minds of the nation, literary men and divines
                    equally with statesmen. For the first part of the period, the resolute common
                    sense of Walpole, and the moderate churchmanship of Warburton, accurately
                    represented the English mind. The defect of a compromise is, as was said in the
                    last section, that it does not kindle enthusiasm; under it politics and
                    politicians are apt to grow dull and vapid. Such a state of things prevailed at
                    the time of the rising of 1745, when the young Pretender was not very far from
                    succeeding, from sheer inertness on the part of those concerned in upholding the
                    Revolution settlement. Soon afterwards there was a change. Young men grew up,
                    before whose eyes floated visions of an expanding empire; the rapid advance of
                    the American colonies, the success of Englishmen in India, on both which fields
                    France was then our rival, stimulated the genius of the elder Pitt, and
                    furnished themes for the eloquence of Burke. Then the value of those principles
                    of political liberty which had been consolidated at the Revolution came to be
                    understood. Through these Pitt achieved in the Seven Years’ War his memorable
                    triumph over the absolute monarchies of France and Spain; and at the Peace of
                    Paris (1763) England stood at the greatest height of national glory which is
                    recorded in her history. Yet the brilliant scene was soon overcast. A Toryism
                    without ideas, which was but in fact the portion of Revolution-Whiggism which
                    refused to move with the times, aided by the personal influence of a
                    narrow-minded, illiberal king, got possession of the administration, and
                    immediately everything went wrong. The American war succeeded, and neither the
                    authority of Chatham nor the enlightenment of Burke and Wyndham could prevent
                    its ending in disaster. Soon after the Peace of Versailles the younger Pitt,
                    then a sincere Whig, came into power. He applied himself with great skill and
                    industry to the work of binding firmly together that inheritance of
                    empire,—still sufficiently ample, —which the peace had left us, when in the
                    middle of his task he was suddenly confronted by the portentous outbreak of the
                    French revolution.</p>
                <p>This period witnessed the foundation of the science of political economy by Adam

                    eminent historians and philosophers, of whose works some notice will be taken
                    presently. In other departments of literature, after the death of Pope, it was
                    but poorly distinguished. Gray will be long remembered for the beauty and melody
                    of some of his pieces,—the <hi rend="italic">Elegy in a Country Churchyard,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bard,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Progress of
                    Poesy.</hi> In the elegant poems of Goldsmith occur passages of sentiment, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the famous lines “Ill fares the land,” &lt;fcc., which
                    read like anticipations of Rousseau. The satires of Churchill, though vigorous
                    and pointed, are founded upon no intelligible principle; they have no universal
                    character, like those of Pope, nor do they represent any definite political or
                    religious view; rather they are dictated by mere national prejudice <hi
                    rend="italic">{e-g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Prophecy of Famine,</hi> a
                    tirade against the Scotch), or by vulgar partisanship,—the eternal animosity of
                    the outs against the ins. The <hi rend="italic">Rosciad</hi> was a satire upon a
                    stage sunk so low as not to be worth satirizing. There is much sweetness and
                    grace in the verses of Shenstone; they formed part of the intellectual food
                    which nourished the strong soul of Burns. Collins’s <hi rend="italic">Ode to the
                    Passions,</hi> so much praised by our grandfathers, is gradually passing out of
                    ken. The <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi> of Young demand our notice, as
                    the work of a man of large intellectual capacity, though of ignoble character.
                    His meditations, though they never pass into the mystical or transcendental
                    stage, are just and edifying; in applying them he displays a rich sermonizing
                    vein; but a flavour of cant hangs about his most ambitious efforts. Beattie’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Minstrel,</hi> a poem in the Spenserian stanza, deserves a
                    passing word of commendation; it unites manly dignity to refinement and delicacy
                    of feeling. Cowper, ever on the brink of insanity, resorted to literature in
                    order to prevent his mind from preying on itself. An amiable piety makes his <hi
                    rend="italic">Task,</hi> a long moralizing poem in blank verse, attractive to
                    many minds; from the mere literary point of view, it must be allowed to be a
                    feeble production. As he gained more confidence in himself, he developed a
                    curious sort of mild feline humour, which appears in the delightful ballad of
                    <hi rend="italic">John Gilpin,</hi> and in several shorter pieces. The strength
                    which had been wanting all his life came to him near its close, and inspired him
                    to write those stanzas of wondrous majesty and beauty which have the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Castaway;</hi> —unhappily it was thestrength of spiritual
                    despair.</p>
                <p>Beyond the Tweed, as Johnson was sinking towards the grave, and when the voice of
                    English poetry had almost ceased to sound, a man of genius was coming to
                    maturity, whose direct and impassioned utterances, straight from the heart of
                    nature, were to reduce the frigid imitators of Pope to their proper
                    insignificance, to startle the dull worshippers of the conventional, and to
                    prepare the English-speaking world for that general break-up of formulas which
                    the tempest of the French Revolution was about to initiate. Robert Burns was a
                    native force; no foreign literature moulded him, no influence of Continental
                    thought either made or marred him. He had the education of a Scottish peasant,
                    and his self-culture does not appear to have consisted in much more than reading
                    Pope and Shenstone, the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> Sterne’s novels, aud a
                    few other popular books. His natural powers were of the finest and highest
                    order. Truly writes his countryman, the late Professor Craik: “Burns’s head was
                    as strong as his heart; his natural sagacity, logical faculty, and judgment were
                    of the first order; no man, of poetical or prosaic temperament, ever had a more
                    substantial intellectual character.” The man being such, and such the equipment
                    with which education and circumstance had furnished him, we observe with
                    interest that he came into serious collision, on becoming complete master of his
                    powers, with the religious system,—that of the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland,—in
                    which he had been brought up. It neither awed, nor attracted, nor convinced him.
                    He never wrote more powerfully, or with a more searching humour, than when
                    employed in exposing the hypocrisy and fanaticism of certain of its
                    ministers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Holy Willies
                    Prayer,” “The Holy Fair,” &amp;c.</p></note> If he had friends among them, it
                    was among the “Moderates,” a party corresponding to the Broad Church clergy of
                    the present day, whom their colleagues in the Presbyterian ministry regarded
                    with undisguised abhorrence. Religion, therefore, established no control over
                    him; and unhappily this splendid nature found no resource in philosophy, nor
                    moral strength within, which could avail to save him from the tyranny of his
                    passions. “Vina, Venus,”— two out of the three banes spoken of by the Roman
                    epigrammatist,—undermined too soon that stalwart frame, and silvered that
                    glorious head. He died in his thirtyseventh year in 1796, leaving behind him,
                    besides a few longer pieces, more than 200 songs, among which may be found gems
                    of pathos, melody, and beauty, which any nation might be proud to wear in its
                    intellectual coronet.</p>
                <p>In the history of the drama during this period, the most noteworthy feature is
                    the return of Shakespeare to the stage, brought about, soon after the middle of
                    the century, by the reverent zeal of Garrick. When Drury Lane theatre was opened
                    in 1747, chiefly for the performance of Shakespeare’s plays, Johnson wrote the
                    celebrated Prologue which was delivered on the occasion, describing the great
                    dramatist as “exhausting worlds and then imagining new,” as spurning the
                    “bounded reign” of real existence, and forcing time to “pant after him in vain.”
                    Comedy, no longer gross, had become commonplace. From this reproach the two
                    admirable plays of Goldsmith, <hi rend="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</hi> and
                    7'7/e <hi rend="italic">Good-Natured Man,</hi> temporarily freed it; nor could
                    it be justly imputed during the period of Sheridan’s connection with the stage,
                    from 1775 to 1780. But the wit that blazes,—the fun that sparkles,—in the scenes
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Rivals</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Critic,</hi> are
                    of no purely English growth. Sheridan’s Irish birth and Celtic temperament must
                    be largely credited with the brightness and permanent attractiveness of his
                    plays.</p>
                <p>Prose fiction, which more and more came to supply that kind of intellectual
                    distraction which had before been sought in the drama, and, aided by the
                    printing press, to diffuse its blessings (if they are blessings) to strata of
                    the population which the drama had never reached, was employed in this period by
                    several writers of rare ability. Fielding’s <hi rend="italic">Tom Jones</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Amelia,</hi> Richardson’s <hi rend="italic">Clarissa
                    Harlowe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sir Charles Grandison,</hi> made the same
                    kind of stir in general society that had been caused by Dryden’s heroic plays
                    some eighty years before. An ingenious French critic (Philarète Chasles) has
                    attempted to trεce in the works of these writers the conflict, though much
                    transformed, of the Puritans and Cavaliers of an earlier age. Lovelace, he
                    thinks, represents the insolent temper and disregard for morality of the
                    aristocratic Cavaliers; Clarissa, his victim, the daughter of a virtuous middle
                    class family, exhibits the substantial rectitude of that “good old cause,” which
                    licentious courts could persecute but could not subdue. Fielding, the
                    aristocrat, recalls and continues the jovial recklessness of the men of the
                    Restoration; Richardson, the plebeian, is in the line of Milton, Penn, Fox,
                    Bunyan, and other witnesses. Yet these resemblances are after all superficial.
                    It is true that Fielding cannot help writing like a gentleman, and a member of
                    an ancient house; while Richardson, though he is fond of giving titles to his
                    characters, betrays perhaps by his <hi rend="italic">seriousness</hi> his
                    breeding among the upper and most respectable classes of the proletariate. But
                    when we_.look more closely, we find <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n449/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0449-0430"/> that both Fielding and Richardson adhere firmly
                    to the Revolution-compromise, both in religion and politics,—and the one quite
                    as much as the other. Fielding is as zealous a Protestant as Bunyan or Baxter;
                    and the doctrine of nonresistance was rejected by him as warmly as by the Whig
                    prosecutors of Sacheverell. Richardson, again, is neither a republican nor a
                    nonconformist. He finds no objection, on the score of tolerance and latitude, to
                    the church of Burnet, Tillotson, and Hoadly; and the hereditary presidency which
                    the Act of Settlement had vested in the Hanoverian family was too feeble and
                    inoffensive to excite in the breast of the most zealous of Whigs fears of the
                    preponderance of the regal power in the constitution. Both Richardson and
                    Fielding are entirely satisfied with the political and religious constitution of
                    the land they live in. Dismissing such fancies, let us consider what were the
                    actual occasions which led to the production of <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi>
                    and the novels which followed it, and in what relation they stand to preceding
                    literary work. They were in the main at once the symptoms and the developing
                    causes of a reaction against the sentimental romances with which ladie3 and
                    gentlemen had stuffed their heads and beguiled their time in the 17th and in the
                    early part of the 18th century. A list of the chief works of this kind of
                    literature is to be found in Addison’s amusing paper on Leonora’s library <hi
                    rend="italic">(Spectator,</hi> No. 37); it includes Sidney’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcadia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Grand Cyrus, Cassandra, Pharamond,
                    Cleopatra,</hi> &amp;c*, the works named being all translations from the French
                    romances of Scudery and Calprenède. The excessive popularity of this kind of
                    reading is intimated by Addison when he says (No. 92), adverting to letters
                    which he has received in relation to his project of forming a perfect “lady’s
                    library,” that he has been “advised to place <hi rend="italic">Pharamond</hi> at
                    the head of his catalogue, and, if he thinks proper, to give the second place to
                    <hi rend="italic">CassaηdraP</hi> In the character of Leonora herself, Addison
                    mildly ridicules the sentimentality, affectation, and unreality which such
                    reading, carried to excess, engenders. Richardson, whose father was a Derbyshire
                    joiner, and who was brought up to the trade of a printer, in which he persevered
                    all his life and prospered, had reached his fiftieth year when he was requested
                    by two London booksellers to write for publication a series of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Familiar Letters,</hi> for the instruction of persons who did not know how to
                    express themselves properly in writing about the ordinary affairs of life. He
                    consented, but proposed to give a moral and improving turn to the instruction to
                    be communicated; to this the booksellers at once agreed. While he was writing
                    model letters giving advice to young women going out to service, the incidents
                    of a story which had come within his own experience occurred to his mind. It
                    seemed to him that this story, if told by way of letters, “in an easy and
                    natural manner, suitable to the simplicity of it, might possibly introduce a new
                    species of writing that might turn young people into a course of reading
                    different from the pomp and parade of romance writing, and, dismissing the
                    improbable and marvellous, with which novels generally abound, might tend to
                    promote the cause of religion and virtue.” The heroine of his tale was a simple
                    country girl, without book learning, but strong in virtue and honesty of heart,
                    to whom he gave the name <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> (one of the two
                    princesses in Sidney’s <hi rend="italic">Arcadia),</hi> as if to show that, to
                    quote from Emerson, “the life of man is the true romance, which, if it be
                    valiantly conducted, will yield the imagination a higher charm than any
                    fiction.” Pamela’s virtue is assailed by the young libertine in whose house she
                    is living as a servant; she resists him, and her “virtue” is “rewarded <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,l</hi> (this is the second title of the book) by the honour
                    and glory of marriage with this reprobate, who, being a fine gentleman, and
                    stooping to a union with a “lass of low degree,” atones for all past
                    shortcomings by this amazing condescension. The book was well received; Pope,
                    then declining towards the tomb, praised it as “likely to do more good than
                    twenty volumes of sermons.” There was, however, a strain of vulgarity in the
                    manner in which the catastrophe of this romance of real life was narrated; and
                    this defect was noted by the eagle eye of Fielding. As a burlesque upon <hi
                    rend="italic">Pamela,</hi> he wrote (1742) the <hi rend="italic">Adventures of
                    Joseph Andrews.</hi> Joseph is a virtuous footman who resists the improper
                    advances of the titled lady in whose service he is; this of course was mere jest
                    and caricature; in the end Joseph, instead of, like Pamela, marrying out of his
                    condition, is wedded, as common sense would dictate, to a pretty modest girl of
                    his own rank. The bent of his own powers, and the suitableness of this new field
                    for their employment, must have been revealed to Fielding while writing <hi
                    rend="italic">Joseph Andrews.</hi> Till now it had been his ambition to shine as
                    a dramatist, and he had produced some plays of no inconsiderable merit; but soon
                    after the appearance of his first novel he quitted the stage and gave up the
                    remainder of his life, so far as it was not engrossed by the duties of a zealous
                    police magistrate, partly to the production of essays on social topics, partly
                    to novel-writing. <hi rend="italic">Tom Jones</hi> (1749) is allowed to be his
                    master-piece; it is one of the finest pieces of character-painting to be found
                    in the whole range of literature. Yet it must be understood that Fielding’s
                    characters belong to a social medium from which the ideal and the heroic are
                    shut out by the conditions of its existence; the “compromise” which England had
                    accepted repressed enthusiasm and a high strain of virtue in every direction; no
                    creations, therefore, possessing the immortal interest of some of those in <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> could be expected from him who has been sometimes
                    called the “English Cervantes.” But taking them as they are, the characters of
                    Tom Jones and Blifil, of Thwackum and Square, present us with inimitable types.
                    Tom Jones, as the generous, manly youth, whom passion hurries into vice, but
                    good feeling and innate rectitude never fail to rescue, is contrasted with the
                    artful hypocrite Blifil, whose outward demeanour pays a homage to virtue which
                    his secret practices and desires undo. Thwackum, the pedagogue, shows what comes
                    of a pedantic learning which has nothing of the largeness of true culture;
                    Square, the thinker, exhibits the moral decadence that results from a grovelling
                    philosophy. In 1748 Richardson published <hi rend="italic">Clarissa
                    Harlowe,</hi> and in 1753 &gt;S⅛'r <hi rend="italic">Charles Grandison;</hi>
                    both these novels are in the epistolary form. <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi>
                    soon obtained a European reputation, the sentimental metaphysics which
                    constitute so large a portion of it being exactly to the taste of a large number
                    of readers in France and Switzerland. Rousseau adopted the style, while
                    corrupting the principles, of the English author, when he wrote <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Heloιse.</hi> The casuistry of love and seduction is interminable; so also is
                    the novel of <hi rend="italic">Clarissa,</hi> yet perhaps no reader who had
                    launched fairly into it ever put the book down unfinished. It excites a deep
                    tragic interest which no formal tragedy produced in England had awakened for
                    several generations; the noble Clarissa, dying because she cannot brook a stain
                    which yet touched not her will, nor came near her conscience, is a spectacle
                    pathetic and touching in the extreme. The chivalrous, but provokingly perfect,
                    Sir Charles Grandison was the character created by Richardson as a kind of
                    contrast to, and compensation for, the aristocratic villain, Lovelace. His
                    embarrassing situation between two lovely women who both adore him, and both of
                    whom he loves, the English Harriet and the Italian Clementina,— though in the
                    brief telling it seems absurd,—is managed in the novel with so much art and <hi
                    rend="italic">vraisemblance</hi> as to inspire the reader during seven volumes
                    with a genuine perplexity and solicitude. His abrupt half-declaration to
                    Harriet—</p>

                <p>“Honour forbids me; yet honour bids me;—yet I cannot be unjust, ungenerous,
                    selfish!”—is a delicious <hi rend="italic">morceau</hi> which can never fail to
                    captivate, and fill with <hi rend="italic">attendrissement,</hi> souls of
                    sensibility. After Richardson and Fielding came Smollett, with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Roderick Random</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Humphrey Clinker,</hi>
                    novels of coarser mould, and Sterne with <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Sentimental Journey.</hi> As works of humour, which
                    contain also several admirable and minutely drawn pictures of character, the two
                    last-named works, or at any rate <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy,</hi> stand
                    alone in our literature; but they are not in the proper sense of the term
                    novels. It is interesting to note that Sheridan borrowed some of his most
                    popular characters from the novelists; Charles and Joseph Surface are evident
                    copies of Tom Jones and Blifil; while Tabitha Bramble and Sir Ulic Mackilligut
                    are no less manifestly the originals of Mrs Malaprop and Sir Lucius O’Trigger.
                    These are not the only resemblances; in fact <hi rend="italic">Humphrey
                    Clinker</hi> is the mine out of which Sheridan dug <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rivals.</hi> Nothing was more common, in the drama of the Elizabethan age, than
                    for the play-wrights to take their plots from novels. But in the present case we
                    note a difference in the mode of procedure, which is a marked testimony to the
                    increased relative importance of the novel. The Elizabethan dramatists borrowed
                    only names and incidents; they created their characters. The Georgian dramatists
                    often borrowed their characters ready made from the pages of the novels, now
                    glowing with a warmer life and richer colouring than their own. To the novels
                    already mentioned Goldsmith’s <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</hi> (1766)
                    must be added,—the book which first drew Goethe’s attention to English
                    literature, and disclosed the hitherto unsuspected <hi rend="italic"
                    >idyllic</hi> side of the existence of the good Protestant village pastor. To
                    pass over inferior writers (Frances Burney, Henry Mackenzie, &lt;fcc.), enough
                    has been said to show that England, after the middle of the 18th century,
                    obtained a school of novel-writers of her own, and shook herself free from the
                    trammels alike of French classicism and French romanticism; nor have the able
                    writers who then came into prominence ever wanted worthy successors down to the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>The luminous intellect of Voltaire had, in the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur les
                    Moeurs,</hi> cast a fresh light on history, which was soon reflected in the
                    writings of English students in this field. In the preface to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai,</hi> Voltaire said that the question was no longer to
                    inform the world “in what year a prince who did not deserve to be remembered
                    succeeded another barbarian like himself, in the midst of a rude and coarse
                    nation.” Henceforth it would be the business of a historian to seek out, amidst
                    the throng of recorded events, “that which deserves to be known by us,—the
                    spirit, the manners, the usages of the principal nations.” Not believing in
                    Christianity, and looking to intellectual and literary culture as the great
                    means of human progress, Voltaire naturally regarded the history of the first
                    ten centuries of our era as “no more deserving of being known than the history
                    of the wolves and the bears;” feudalism and the Middle Ages filled him with
                    disgust; it was only when he came to the Renaissance, with its revival of
                    learning, its tolerance of theological differences, and its love of polish, that
                    he seemed to find anything worth writing a history about. H ume, composing a <hi
                    rend="italic">History of England</hi> (1754) under the influence of ideas not
                    very dissimilar to those of Voltaire, and commencing with the Stuart period, was
                    not likely to write favourably of the Puritans, who were neither tolerant nor
                    polished. His work accordingly gave much offence to the Whig party, which had
                    inherited the political traditions of Puritanism. Robertson’s historical
                    pictures,—of Scotland, of Charles V., and of the settlement of America, —did
                    not, except incidentally, go back beyond the period of the Renaissance; the
                    actions of men who lived before that age seemed to him scarcely on a par with
                    the “dignity of history.” Gibbon’s great work, the <hi rend="italic">Decline and
                    Fall of the Roman Empire,</hi> is designed to trace the gradual political
                    debilitation of the empire, and the extinction of letters and arts through the
                    ravages of the barbarians; thence passing with a firm and vigorous step through
                    the long night of barbarism he dilates with eloquence and delight on the story
                    of the rekindling of the flame of learning, and the renewed appreciation of
                    beauty and refinement, which characterized the Italian Renaissance of the 14th
                    and 15th centuries. We see that the historians of the 18th century, our own
                    among the number, regarded the early and middle ages of our era as the province
                    of the antiquary and the annalist rather than the historian proper,—who, if he
                    dealt with them at all, should despatch them in brief summaries, in which,
                    assuming an air of great superiority, he should try the men of the 9th or any
                    other early century by the prevalent ideas of the eighteenth. Obviously, in the
                    age in which we live, we have “changed all that;” the age of the Renaissance no
                    longer presents itself to our eyes with such an overpowering lustre; and
                    research into the motives and cast of thought of a Charlemagne or a Henry II.
                    seems to us no longer beneath the “dignity of history.”</p>
                <p>In theology, one very remarkable work belongs to this period,— Butler’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Mature</hi>
                    (1736). This is an apologetic work, and may perhaps be regarded as the last word
                    in the deistical controversy. Butler, whose caution and fairness of mind are
                    truly admirable, and who does not pretend that the inquiry which he institutes
                    leads to more than <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> conclusions, argues in this
                    work that it is just as difficult to believe nature to have proceeded from and
                    to be ruled by God, as to admit that Christianity has a divine origin. This line
                    of reasoning, though cogent as against the deists, most of whom admitted a
                    divine author of nature, is obviously insufficient to meet the scepticism of the
                    present day, which, embracing the theory of evolution, either rejects the belief
                    in a First Cause altogether, or declines to examine it, as lying beyond the
                    scope of the human faculties. The <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> of Bishop
                    Butler, in which he established against Hobbes the fact of the existence in the
                    human mind of disinterested affections and dispositions pointing to the good of
                    others, belongs rather to the department of philosophy than that of
                    theology.</p>
                <p>The philosophical speculations of this period may be described as a series of
                    oscillations round Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> o∕ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">the Human Understanding,—</hi> Hume
                    taking Locke’s principles,and turning them into a theory of scepticism;
                    Hutcheson starting the theory of a new “sense” never dreamed of before, the
                    moral sense; Hartley and Priestley developing Locke’s sensationalism into
                    materialism; while the Scotch school (Reid, Beattie, Dugald Stewart), recoiling
                    from the consequences of Locke’s system, attempted to smuggle “innate ideas”
                    back into philosophy under the names of “common sense,” “instinctive judgments,”
                    “irresistible beliefs,” and so forth. Such brief examination of these writers as
                    our limits allow will mako our meaning clearer.</p>
                <p>Locke’s system, says Dugald Stewart,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Outlines of Moral Philosophy,</hi> ed. by

                    our simple ideas, led him “to some dangerous opinions concerning the nature of
                    moral distinctions, which he seems to have considered as the offspring of
                    education and fashion.” How Berkeley combated the tendencies of Locke’s
                    principles we have already seen. Hutcheson, an Irishman of great acuteness, who
                    was appointed to a philosophical chair at Glasgow in 1729, unwilling to admit
                    that our moral ideashad no other ultimate source than sensation, yet wishing to
                    conform as much as possible to Locke’s terminology, referred the <pb break="no"

                    But this was to use the word “sense” in a different meaning from what it had
                    ever borne before; inasmuch as the objects of this so-called sense, being the
                    qualities of moral actions, must be of necessity incorporeal, intangible, and
                    imperceptible, and, as such, totally unlike the objects of the faculties
                    commonly called senses, viz., sights, sounds, smells, tastes, &amp;c. Nor was
                    anything gained for the independence and immutability of morality; for it was
                    argued by commentators on Hutcheson that, if the moral faculty were a “sense,”
                    then the qualities perceived by it, like the secondary qualities of material
                    objects perceived by sensation and reflection, must be understood as subjective
                    not objective, as existing in and for the perceiving mind alone, aud not
                    inherent in the actions themselves, which would thus become colourless and
                    neutral, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> destitute of moral character.</p>
                <p>A return upon scepticism was a frequent incident in the history of the Greek
                    schools of thought, especially when the principles of opposing systems had been
                    put forth with unusual warmth, and their supporters had found reconciliation and
                    the explanation of differences out of the question. An example of this, in the
                    history of English thought, is furnished by the case of Hume. Provoked by the
                    extravagant paradoxes of Berkeley, who had ecclesiastical and professional
                    reasons for trying to convince men that material objects had no reality,—mind
                    was everything,— since the mystical and unnatural state of mind so engendered
                    would favour the reception of any theology the philosopher might afterwards
                    desire to implant,—Hume undertook to prove that mind had no real existence any
                    more than matter, or that, if it had, such existence could not be proved. When I
                    talk of “my mind,” he said, how do I know that there is anything really existent
                    which corresponds to the words? By the impressions and sensations of which I am
                    conscious? But these only prove themselves; no one of course denies them; I only
                    deny, at least I say you cannot prove, the existence of au entity in which these
                    impressions inhere, and to which you give the name of “mind.” If there was no
                    flaw in such reasoning, philosophy was brought to a stand, and no certainty of
                    any kind was attainable by the human faculties.</p>
                <p>Before the Scotch school and the great Immanuel Kant appeared to challenge these
                    conclusions, David Hartley, in his <hi rend="italic">Observations on Man</hi>
                    (1749), espoused the tenets of Locke, and applied all his ingenuity to
                    explaining the origin of as much of our knowledge as he could with any
                    plausibility so treat, by referring it to the physical principle of the
                    “association of ideas.”</p>
                <p>In the treatise already referred to, Hume declares that he does not wish to
                    undermine or even to combat any man’s belief; his aim was only to demolish bad
                    logic, to expose the emptiness of alleged proofs of the divine government which
                    were no proofs at all, and to make men see that “belief is more properly an act
                    of the sensitive than of the cogitative part of our nature.” The line of thought
                    suggested by this and similar expressions appears to have been taken up and
                    eagerly pursued by Reid, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Human
                    Mind upon the Principles of Common Sense</hi> (1764), maintains that a large,
                    and not the least important part of our knowledge is acquired, not, as Locke
                    asserted, through sensation and reflection, but by means of immediate and
                    instinctive judgments, in forming which the <hi rend="italic">common sense</hi>
                    of all mankind is at one. The moral faculty, according to Reid, judges of right
                    and wrong in this instinctive way: it is a branch of common sense. Beattie, who
                    was a better poet than he was a philosopher, pushed Reid’s theory to an extreme
                    which bordered on the ridiculous, including among the “irresistible” and
                    “necessary” beliefs of the human mind a number of notions which are really of a
                    historic and derivative character. Dr Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen,
                    adopting the system of Locke as a basis, wrote on <hi rend="italic">Matter and
                    Spirit,</hi> criticised the philosophy of Reid, and discussed the tenet of
                    philosophical necessity; a strong materialistic bias pervades his writings. A
                    greater thinker than any that Europe had witnessed since Descartes, now arose in
                    Germany. This was Kant, whose ambition it was to put a period to the desolating
                    prevalence of scepticism, and deliver philosophy from the instability and
                    uncertainty by which it had been long beset. His <hi rend="italic">Critique of
                    the Pure Peason</hi> appeared about 1781. Against Locke, he showed that the mind
                    can form neither conceptions nor judgments without the pre-existence in the
                    thought of the absolute and universal ideas of time, space, unity, cause, being,
                    &amp;c.,— which ideas proceed from the intelligence itself, without any action
                    being exerted on the organs of sensation. They are <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> that is, prior to sensible experience; they belong to the pure
                    reason, and may be regarded as the forms of our knowledge,—forms which the
                    understanding applies to the material furnished by perceptions. He does not,
                    however, allow that these ideas, though <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> have
                    any objective character; and for this metaphysical subjectivism he has been
                    strenuously assailed by the Platonizing and orthodox schools of the present day.
                    Against the materialists he maintains, in the <hi rend="italic">Critique of the
                    Practical Peason,</hi> that the “moral motive,” or principle, which the
                    intelligence (called in this aspect the practical reason) furnishes us with for
                    the direction of our will, is immutable,—absolute,— necessary,—given <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> by the reason, and presenting to us the supreme and
                    universal good as the final end of our existence, our desires, and our efforts.
                    This motive is <hi rend="italic">duty,</hi> or the moral obligation imposed on
                    the human will by a power above it, which, consequently, is not man himself. To
                    the knowledge, therefore, derived from the practical reason, Kant ascribes an
                    <hi rend="italic">objective</hi> character, which, as we saw, he denied to the
                    forms of the pure reason. This law of duty supposes liberty in man as the very
                    condition of the obligation which it imposes on him. Here of course Kant is at
                    variance with the necessitarians and materialists. There being a necessary
                    connection between virtue, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the obedience to duty,
                    and the supreme good which it seeks, yet this connection being only partially
                    realizable in this life, Kant infers the reality of a future life and the
                    immortality of the soul. And, in view of our powerlessness to bring about this
                    harmony between happiness and virtue, he infers the existence of a First Cause,
                    infinitely powerful, just, and wise, which will establish it hereafter. The
                    colossal system of Kant was known to Dugald Stewart (whose first work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Outlines of Moral Philosophy,</hi> appeared in 1793), but only
                    through the medium of an imperfect Latin translation; from this cause, probably,
                    he is thought to have failed to do full justice to it. Dugald Stewart, who was
                    appointed to the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh in 1785, was the master
                    of a clear and charming style, which made his lectures the delight of a large
                    circle of pupils. Among these were numbered not a few, in the spheres both of
                    thought and action, who have left their mark 0n the age and the society to which
                    they belonged,—Brougham, Lord Palmerston, Lord Russell, Francis Horner,Lord
                    Lansdowne, Jeffrey, Sir Walter Scott, Sydney Smith, James Mill, Alison the
                    historian, and Dr Chalmers,—a varied and brilliant auditory for one pιofessor to
                    have lectured to and influenced in his day. One of the most interesting of
                    Stewart’s numerous works is his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation concerning the
                    Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of
                    Letters in Europe.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Outlines</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0452-0433"/> (the work above mentioned', he argued, keeping
                    generally to the lines of Butler and Hutcheson, that there is a moral faculty in
                    man, that it is guided by duty not by interest, and that these two are not in
                    the present state of the world identical, nor are the feelings that are inspired
                    by actions prompted by the one the same as those which are suggested by actions
                    prompted by the other. Right and wrong, he thinks, must be held to be intrinsic
                    qualities of actions, and not merely modes of the mind observing those actions.
                    Everywhere he is firm and explicit on the immutability of moral distinctions. In
                    fact, in its general outcome his ethical philosophy resembles pretty closely
                    that of Kant; but it is not thought out with the same rigour of logic, nor
                    founded on as searching a psychological analysis, nor expressed in as exact a
                    terminology, as belong to the writings of the philosopher of Königsberg.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution,</hi> 1789-1832.—Probably there was
                    not a single gifted mind in any country of Europe upon which the tempest of the
                    French Revolution did not come with a stimulating or disturbing influence. Young
                    men— hasty counsellors ever, from the days of Rehoboam,—thrilled with hope and
                    flushed with excitement, announced and believed that a golden age had opened for
                    mankind. Wordsworth hastened from Cambridge in 1792 to France, where he lived
                    more than a year, and formed some Girondist acquaintances; Coleridge invented a
                    scheme for an ideal community which was to form a model settlement, to be
                    conducted on principles of pantisocracy, on the banks of the Susquehanna;
                    Southey nearly got himself into trouble by publishing <hi rend="italic">JVat
                    Tyler,</hi> a dramatic sketch of an inflammatory and seditious character. On the
                    other hand, the young Walter Scott looked with shrewd, clear eyes on the
                    tumultuous scene, and was not tempted to throw himself into the vortex; for him
                    the treasures of Europe’s mighty past were real and precious, and not to be
                    bartered for any quantity of visionary hopes and fairy gold. Soon the
                    proceedings of the Revolutionists made it clear enough that human nature and
                    human motives were not changed; and the rauks of reaction were rapidly filled.
                    In England an immense effect was produced by the appearance of Burke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reflections on the French Revolution</hi> in 1791. The
                    sympathizers with the French republicans dwindled in number so fast, that at the
                    end of the century, as it was sportively said, the whole of the opposition to
                    Pitt’s Government in the House of Lords went home from the debate in a single
                    hack cab. Wordsworth, Southey, and Coleridge changed round to the Conservative
                    side. The appearance in France of the <hi rend="italic">Genie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Christianisme</hi> (1802) by Chateaubriand marked the
                    commencement of the great continental reaction. The public policy of England
                    became essentially conservative; she endeavoured to prop up all the old
                    monarchies on the Continent, whether they deserved to live or not; she harboured
                    thousands of French priests; she supported the temporal power of the pope. A
                    remarkable dissonance hence arose.between the policy of the country and some of
                    the finest notes in its literature, while the English aristocracy was putting
                    forth its full strength to combat Jacobinism by land and sea, the spirit of
                    revolution breathed from the pages of Shelley and Byron. The war with Napoleon
                    waβ waged with the approval of the great majority of the nation; but the able
                    critics and publicists who conducted the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>
                    (started in 1802) were vehemently opposed toit, and would, if their influence
                    had prevailed, have withdrawn the sword of England from the contest at least ten
                    years before Waterloo.</p>
                <p>The romantic poems of Scott <hi rend="italic">(Lay of the Last Minstrel, Marmion,
                    Lady of the Lake,</hi> &amp;c.) were popular because they were in sympathy with
                    the return (now strongly pronounced) of the European mind towards chivalry,
                    feudalism, and the mediaeval spirit. The works of the Renaissance were no longer
                    praised; its art was held to be imitative or debased, its refinement to be
                    superficial, its enthusiasm factitious. Taking its cue from Rousseau, all the
                    world was thirsting, or pretending to thirst, after nature and simplicity; the
                    <hi rend="italic">naivete</hi> and spontaneity, real or imagined, of the “ages
                    of faith” seemed incalculably better than the <hi rend="italic">finesse</hi> and
                    self-consciousness of modern times. Working this vein somewhat too long, Scott
                    was at last outshone in it by Byron, whose romantic tales <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bride of Abydos, The Corsair, The Giaour,</hi> &amp;c.) were still more remote
                    from the dulness and conventionality of ordinary life than those of Scott. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold,</hi> a poem finely but unequally versified in
                    the Spenserian stanza, the noble poet described himself,—for no one ever doubted
                    that he was himself “the great sublime he drew,”—travelling through Spain,
                    Italy, and Greece, a prey to melancholy discontent, brooding over the perishing
                    relics of departed greatness, but unable to utter any formula potent for its
                    re-creation other than vague cries for the bursting of all fetters which repress
                    the spirit or the limbs of men The increasing moral disorder of Byron’s mind is
                    marked by the appearance of <hi rend="italic">Don Juan,</hi> a long rambling
                    poem, written after his wife had left him, and he had gone to the Continent in
                    1816, never to return. In 1823 he joined the Greek insurgents who had taken arms
                    to throw off the Turkish yoke. He landed at Missolonghi, spent large sums of
                    money, but effected nothing of importance; and in April 1824 he was cut off by a
                    fever.</p>
                <p>Shelley is a striking illustration of the influence which the revolutionary
                    literature of that age possessed in moulding or modifying human character. His
                    own earliest recollections dated to a time when all ranks of English society
                    were animated by feelings of horror and detestation at the French “Terror,” and
                    in no mood to embrace any revolutionary sentiment, or even give a hearing to any
                    novel opinion. Yet the mind of Shelley—nursed upon the sceptical suggestions of
                    Hume, the utopian speculations of Godwin, and the antinomian dreams of Rousseau,
                    and pushing to extremes, from the fervour of a nature in which prudence and
                    diffidence found no place, all that he read— was in a state of high revolt, even
                    in his college days, against all that was held sacred by other men. Sent away
                    from Oxford, he fell in with the bright high-spirited Harriet Westbrook, and
                    induced her to marry him. But all bonds, including those of matrimony, which
                    fettered the free inclinations of the mind, Shelley had taught himself to regard
                    as a tyranny to be withstood. He grew tired of Harriet, formed a connexion of
                    free love with Mary Godwin, and deserted his hapless wife, who, two years
                    afterwards, committed suicide. Whether Shelley would e-ver have brought his wild
                    actions and wilder thoughts under any discipline it is impossible to tell, for
                    he was cut off by a sudden and early death. His poems display the most perfect
                    and wonderful mastery of the resources of the English language for the purposes
                    of imaginative expression that has ever been attained to among our poets. As
                    Pope and 'Dryden gave us logic in metre, so Byron and Shelley gave us rhetoric
                    in metre. Splendid pieces of declamation may be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Childe Harold</hi> and “Isles of Greece” of the one poet, and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hellas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Revolt of Lslam</hi> of the
                    other. The “Sky-lark,” and some other poems, considered as creations of the pure
                    imagination, have surely never been surpassed.</p>
                <p>An accidental circumstance,—the finding of an old unfinished MS. in a forgotten
                    nook of a cabinet,—turned Sir Walter Scott into the path of prose fiction, in
                    which his strong memory and inexhaustible imagination, joined with a gift for
                    picturesque description, and the faculty, within certain limite, of creating and
                    presenting living types of character, eminently qualified him to excel. Then <pb

                    series of novels, commencing with <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi> and ending
                    (when his mind had partially given way) with <hi rend="italic">Castle
                    Dangerous.</hi> We do not forget that a living French critic, whose admirable
                    style makes even his paradoxes attractive, treats the Waverley Novels with
                    little ceremony; they were taken, he says, for faithful copies of the antique
                    world in Europe •at a time when people knew no better; now we go to the original
                    sources of information, and find that he distorts everything. But, in the first
                    place, so far as the Waverley Novels consist of the skilful evolution of plots
                    invented by the author, and of the contrasted play of characters created by
                    him,—and not of historical pictures,—this criticism does not touch them at all.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Peυeril of the Peak,</hi> for instance, where a peculiar
                    zest attaches itself to the love of Julian Peveril for Alice Bridgenorth on
                    account of the political and religious differences which divide their fathers,
                    though Scott might be proved to have omitted some important features in his
                    historic sketch of the Restoration, still the deep attraction of the story would
                    not lose its charm. So again, in <hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe,</hi> although the
                    repulsion between Saxon and Norman—the concrete picture of which, presented in
                    this novel, so deeply impressed the historian Thierry—be to some extent an
                    exaggeration of the feelings which actually prevailed between the two races
                    under Richard I., yet neither does this inaccuracy affect the substantial
                    truthfulness and instructiveness of the historic <hi rend="italic">tableau,</hi>
                    nor, if it did, would the tragic passages which describe the siege of the castle
                    of Front-de-Bceuf exercise an inferior fascination. But, secondly, the real
                    meaning of M. Taine’s charge is, not that Scott has mis-read history, but that
                    he has not read it from the special philosophical standpoint of M. Taine. He did
                    not read it in the conviction of the relativity of all events, nor regard it
                    simply as the evolution of the Welt-Geist, nor believe that human society,
                    through the stages of theology and metaphysics, advances inevitably to the bourn
                    of positive science. But it remains to be proved whether these views of history
                    will not prove more ephemeral than the simpler conceptions which possessed the
                    mind of Sir Walter Scott.</p>
                <p>Reference was made above to the commencement of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review</hi> in 1802. The tendencies of thought which distinguished its founders
                    were of so remarkable a character,—exercised so marked an effect on the
                    philosophy, the legislation, and even the literature of their times,—and are
                    still so influential, that some attempt to analyse and describe them must be
                    made. There were varieties of opinion among the writers for this celebrated
                    review from the first; amongst them were mere Whigs and mere literary critics,
                    but that which gave it a backbone was its being partially the organ of a party,
                    known somo years later by the name of “Philosophical Radicals.” This school took
                    its philosophy from Locke, Bentham, and Adam Smith. It held that the old systems
                    which admitted the principle of authority were for ever ruined and discredited,
                    that, as government was an affair of contract, so religion was an affair of
                    evidence, and that, since the same evidence was estimated differently by
                    different minds, the right course was, to confine religion within the domain of
                    the individual conscience, tolerating all forms of it not antisocial, but giving
                    political prominence to none. Coleridge, in an eloquent work published in
                    1829,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Constitution of Church and State.</hi></p></note> supported the theory of a
                    national church, not as the channel for teaching religious truth, but as
                    providing a machinery for diffusing culture and enlightenment, as well as
                    teaching morality by example, through the length and breadth of the land. This
                    view was too Platonic for the school we are now considering—which, however, did
                    not attack the already existing established church, but contented itself with
                    insisting that its clergy should be vigilantly controlled by the state, lest
                    they should teach principles or practices inconsistent with the general good.
                    Churches they regarded as decrepit and perishing institutions; it was the state
                    which, in their eyes, flourished in immortal youth; and their hopes of future
                    good were involved in the development of civilization under its auspices. They
                    believed in the gradual advance and perfectibility of the race through the
                    operation of wise institutions, furthering the free play of all the human
                    faculties, while guaranteeing the order and stability of society. The happiness
                    that would thence arise, consisting in the realization of “the greatest good of
                    the greatest number,” they regarded as the satisfaction of enthusiasm and the
                    goal of effort. To political economy, that eminently <hi rend="italic">lay</hi>
                    study, and to the development of physical science, they looked for the measures
                    and the means requisite for the attainment of this happiness. Moreover, since,
                    from their point of view, there was nothing absolute in moral sanctions, it was
                    ridiculous fora nation to hamper itself by adherence to engagements contracted
                    by a former generation, on the plea of national honour, if such adherence was
                    prejudicial to the interests of the living. Views of this kind, beginning even
                    then to be propounded, drew from Burke the exclamation that the “age of chivalry
                    was past,” and that “that of sophists, economists, and calculators had
                    succeeded.” The study of social grievances, and of the means of removing them,
                    assumed a prominent place among their objects, and gave rise to much laudable
                    and beneficial activity. On humanitarian grounds they supported the agitation
                    against slavery which Christian philanthropists like Clarkson and Wilberforce
                    had commenced from a religious motive. Senior occupied himself with the evils of
                    the old poor-law; Francis Horner became a great authority on finance; Sir Samuel
                    Romilly took up the reform of our criminal jurisprudence; Ricardo, J. S. Mill,
                    and M'Culloch studied the laws of the creation and distribution of wealth, and
                    demonstrated the impolicy of restrictions on trade. The benefits of national
                    education began to be seen and enforced; and Lancaster and Bell entered upon
                    useful labours connected with tffe organization of schools and the supply of
                    teachers. Harriet Martineau wrote popular tales, and Elliott “Corn-law Rhymes,”
                    in order to indoctrinate the multitude with sound views on economical questions.
                    In short, all the good was done or attempted which men starting from the basis
                    of empirical philosophy could do or attempt; whatever was outside the range of
                    that philosophy was neglected.</p>
                <p>There is something rather saddening in the contemplation of the careers of most
                    of the eminent literary men of this epoch. Byron and Shelley were cut off in the
                    flower of their days; Southey’s overtasked brain gave way some years before his
                    death, and the same fate befell Ireland’s gifted singer, Thomas Moore. Scott,
                    ruined through too much haste to be rich, literally worked himself to death to
                    clear off the mountain of liability which his implication in Ballantyne’s
                    failure had thrown upon him. Coleridge, though he lived to old age, had weakened
                    a will originally irresolute, and shattered nerves originally over-sensitive by
                    the fatal practice of opium-eating; in the time of grey hairs he subsided into a
                    dreamy talker about “sum-in ject” and “om-in-ject.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Carlyle’s <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Sterling.</hi></p></note> Wordsworth alone preserved to the last an unimpaired
                    sanity of mind and body, for which he might thank the simplicity and serenity of
                    his life in Westmoreland, where he settled on his return from France. Rapt in
                    profound meditation, he communed among the mountains with the spirit of the
                    universe; and the beauty of the crag, the tarn, the flower, transmitted itself,
                    through <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n454/mode/1up"

                    wondrous melody. When the period of inspiration was past, he quietly conformed
                    to the religion and politics of his neighbours, and wrote much in support of
                    them; but these later works are pitched in a lower key.</p>
                <p>Since the death of Scott, the power of literature, combined with journalism, has
                    been continually on the rise. The novelists, while describing, have modified our
                    social customs; the essayists have been instrumental in bringing about political
                    reforms; the poets have stirred,—generally to thoughts and desires of
                    change,—the impressible hearts of the young. The power of art over the human
                    mind, and its influence in determining the aspects of life, have been, in all
                    English-speaking countries, declining, while that of literature has been
                    advancing. Whether this particular distribution of the master-influences that
                    affect mankind will continue to prevail, or whether artis destined to regain
                    among us a portion of its early power, and the sway of literature to be
                    correspondingly restricted, is a question which the future must decide.</p>
