                <p><label type="entry">EVAPORATION</label> is that process by which liquids arid
                    solids assume the gaseous state at their free surfaces. The rate at which
                    evaporation takeβ place depends upon the temperature of the liquid or solid, the
                    extent of the exposed surface, and the facility with which the gaseous particles
                    can escape from the neighbourhood of the surface either by diffusion through the
                    air or by the motion of the air itself. Hence a strong wind will generally
                    accelerate the process of drying. The passage from the gaseous into the liquid
                    condition, or <hi rend="italic">condensation,</hi> and into the solid condition,
                    or <hi rend="italic">sublimation,</hi> are processes the converse of
                    evaporation. The evaporation of a liquid is a phenomenon which we observe daily,
                    and that of a solid sometimes presente itself to our notice, as when snow
                    vanishes by evaporation during a long frost though the temperature never rises
                    to the freezing point. Camphor and iodine also readily evaporate at ordinary
                    temperatures without liquefying, and sublime on the surfaces of the vessels in
                    which they are placed.</p>
                <p>A gas is a substance a finite portion of which will distribute itself through any
                    space, however great, to which it has free access. A substance which can exist
                    in the liquid or solid state at ordinary temperature and under ordinary
                    atmospheric pressure is usually, when in tho gaseous condition, called a vapour;
                    but, though it is easy to give arbitrary definitions, no satisfactory
                    distinction between gases and vapours has yet been made. In fact, the word
                    “vapour” is rapidly giving place to “gas” in most instances. The greatest amount
                    of any substance which can exist in the gaseous condition in the unit of volume
                    depends upon the temperature, but is almost independent of the presence of any
                    other vapour or gas, provided that such gas or vapour possess no chemical

                    will then be accompanied by condensation of part of the vapour, and the space
                    will remain saturated at the new temperature; while if any increase of
                    temperature occur, the space will cease to be saturated with the vapour it
                    contains, and further evaporation will take place if any of the corresponding
                    liquid be present, but if not the space will remain unsaturated, and the vapour

                    which may occupy the same space, the condensed liquid assumes the state of
                    cloud, fog, or mist. The temperature at which a portion of space is saturated

                    condensation, because the increase in the space occupied does not compensate for
                    the reduction of temperature; but there are other vapours which become
                    super-heated by expansion, because the increase in volume more than compensates

                    been generally adopted.</p>
                <p>When a quantity of water is heated from the lower surface, the water near the
                    bottom is at a higher temperature than the superincumbent layers, and the
                    bubbles of steam formed there on rising are surrounded by water at a temperature
                    below the boiling-point, and, being consequently unable to sustain the pressure
                    to which they are exposed, they collapse with a slight sound. These sounds
                    repeated in rapid succession constitute the “singing” of the kettle, and are
                    exchanged for a very much softer sound when the whole of the water reaches the
                    boiling-point, and steam bubbles escape from the surface. Though bubbles of pure
                    steam once produced can exist under atmospheric pressure if the temperature be
                    above the boiling-point, yet such bubbles will not necessarily be produced in
                    pure water as soon as it reaches that temperature. If water which has been
                    carefully freed from air by long boiling be heated in a clean glass vessel, its
                    temperature may be raised considerably above the boiling-point; but as soon as
                    the continuity of the water is broken by the formation of a bubble of steam,
                    ebullition ensues with explosive violence, and the temperature falls nearly to
                    the boiling-point. Drops of water suspended in a mixture of linseed oil and oil
                    of cloves of the same specific gravity have been heated by Dufour to 180° C.,
                    and generally fatty oils poured on the surface of water tend to prevent
                    ebullition. It has been stated that the boiling of <hi rend="italic">pure</hi>
                    water has not yet been observed. Certain solutions, especially strong solutions
                    of caustic alkalies, are very liable to an explosive evolution of steam at
                    intervals, and the best way of preventing it is the introduction, when possible,
                    of a small piece of a metal which can decompose water.</p>
                <p>Though the temperature at which water boils depends on the impurities which it
                    contains, and the nature of the vessel in which it is placed, yet the
                    temperature of the steam above the water depends only on the pressure. This has
                    been long acknowledged when the quantity of impurity dissolved in the water is
                    small, and in order to determine the boiling-points upon thermometers they are
                    immersed in the steam above boiling water without allowing their bulbs to touch
                    the water. When the quantity of salt dissolved is very great, the temperature of
                    the boiling solution is generally very much above the boiling-point of water.
                    Thus, according to Faraday, saturated solutions of common salt, nitre, and
                    potassic carbonate boil at 109°, 115 ’ 6°, and 140° C. respectively. The
                    temperature of ebullition of a saline solution is sometimes employed to
                    determine the percentage of salt present. Notwithstanding the high temperature
                    of the solution, it seems that the temperature of the steam when first liberated
                    from the solution is the same as that produced by water boiling at the same
                    pressure. This conclusion is supported by Dufour, though Magnus and some others
                    were of a different opinion. If a thermometer with a clean un protected bulb be
                    immersed in the steam above a concentrated saline solution boiling at ordinary
                    pressure, its temperature will quickly rise to 100° C., then become almost
                    stationary, and afterwards slowly rise to a temperature somewhat below that of
                    the liquid, and depending on its nearness to the solution and the facilities
                    which are offered for the escape of heat from the bulb. On removing the
                    thermometer and allowing it to cool, there will generally be found a quantity of
                    salt sticking to the bulb which has been splashed upon it from the solution. If
                    the bulb of a thermometer be covered with cotton which has been sprinkled with
                    some salt, and be then immersed in steam, whether above a saline solution or
                    above boiling water, its temperature will quickly rise considerably above the
                    boiling-point, and several thermometers whose bulbs have been covered with
                    different salts will indicate different temperatures if suspended side by side
                    in the same vessel of steam, leading us to suspect that the high temperature
                    recorded by the thermometer above the saline solution may be due in part at
                    least to salt which has been splashed upon the bulb. If the bulb be protected
                    from splashes by a metal screen placed below it, and from condensed water
                    trickling down the stem by a guard placed above it, the temperature will at once
                    rise to 100° C.; but the further rise of temperature will be so slow that it may
                    be accounted for by the radiation from the liquid and from the metal screen,
                    which of course becomes heated in the same way as a naked thermometer placed in
                    its position. If a test tube containing mercury be immersed in the solution, and
                    the thermometer bulb placed in it till it reaches the same temperature, on
                    raising it into the steam the temperature will be seen to fall considerably.</p>
                <p>If a small quantity of a liquid be placed in a metal vessel whose temperature has
                    been raised very much above the boiling-point of the liquid, vapour will be
                    produced so rapidly from the under surface of the liquid that it will be
                    supported on a cushion of its own vapour, and thus prevented from coming into
                    contact with the metal, the separation being so complete that if the liquid be
                    an electrolyte a current from an ordinary battery cannot be made to pass from
                    the liquid to. the metal. This condition of the liquid is called the spheroidal
                    state, and is often referred to as Leidenfrost’s phenomenon. It may frequently
                    be noticed that the drop is in a state of rapid rotation. If by any means an
                    indentation is made in the surface of the drop, vibrations will be set up in it,
                    causing the horizontal section to pass into the form of a curvilinear polygon,
                    in the same manner as the edge of a bell changes its form when struck. The
                    surface of the drop then presents a “beaded” or corrugated appearance, formed by
                    the superposition of the retinal images of the drop in the two extreme
                    conditions which it assumes, and therefore always presenting an <hi
                        rend="italic">even</hi> number of corrugations corresponding to the
                    vibrating segments. Surface tension of course supplies the forces necessary to
                    produce the vibrations. When a ventral segment projects beyond the mean surface
                    of the drop so as to form a “bead,” more surface is exposed by it to the heating
                    action of the metal than when it is in its mean position, and when it lies
                    within the mean, or spheroidal, surface so as to form a “flute,” less surface is
                    exposed by it; but as the generation of steam cannot be instantaneous, more
                    steam will escape from the segment while it is receding towards the centre than
                    while it is advancing, and thus the pressure of the escaping steam upon each
                    ventral segment will vary with the phase of vibration in such a manner as to
                    supply the energy necessary to the continuance of the motion. If the drop be
                    examined by ordinary daylight a fluted outlinι can be distinctly seen within the
                    beaded outline, but if i <pb break="no"

                    sparks, the separate vibration forms will be seen presenting half as many beads
                    and flutes as are presented when the images are superposed through the
                    employment of a continuous light. The lowest temperature at which the spheroidal
                    condition can be produced varies with the nature of the heated surface, the
                    liquid, and the temperature of the liquid when poured into the vessel. It is in
                    virtue of this condition that Faraday found it possible to freeze mercury in a
                    red hot vessel. When the metal is allowed to cool sufficiently, the liquid comes
                    into contact with it, and is wholly or partially converted into vapour with
                    explosive violence. In highly rarefied air water will assume the spheroidal
                    condition at very low temperatures, in consequence of evaporation being
                    accelerated by the diminution of pressure.</p>
                <p>Previous to the introduction of the molecular theory of gases many theories were
                    proposed to explain the diffusion of aqueous vapour through the air. Halley
                    supposed that vapour consisted of small hollow spherules or <hi rend="italic"
                        >vesicles</hi> filled with an <hi rend="italic">aura</hi> considerably
                    lighter than air, which caused them to ascend like balloons, and Atwood followed
                    his hypothesis. Even after the similarity of vapours to air and other so-called
                    permanent gases had been fully recognized, the <hi rend="italic">vesicular</hi>
                    theory was still held in a modified fbrm to explain the suspension of cloud and
                    fog; but in the case of very small drops the resistance of the air is sufficient
                    to prevent the drops acquiring more than an extremely small velocity in
                    consequence of their weight. Hooke supposed that air contains aqueous vapour in
                    a state of chemical solution; but this theory, like the preceding, fails to
                    explain evaporation in vacuo. De Saussure believed that water was first
                    converted into vapour by the action of heat, and then absorbed by the air on
                    account of a chemical affinity; while Halley, Leroy, and Franklin thought that
                    the attraction of the air was instrumental in the first formation of vapour. The
                    advocates of a still older theory maintained that aqueous vapour was a
                    combination of water particles with those of fire, which caused them to ascend,
                    and that contrary winds blowing the particles of water together loosened the
                    fire particles from them, thus allowing them to descend as rain.</p>
                <p>Desaguliers seems to have been the first to identify the nature of steam with
                    that of aqueous vapour at ordinary temperatures, and to recognize the fact that
                    steam is a transparent gas, while the cloud produced by a j. t of steam is
                    really condensed water. In a letter to the president of the Royal Society <hi
                        rend="italic">(Pled. Trans.,</hi> 1729, p. 6), Desaguliers maintained that
                    the cause of vapour rising in the air is a force of repulsion I etween its
                    particles, which separates them so far from each other as to render the vapour
                    specifically lighter than air. The resistance offered by water to compression he
                    accounts for by a similar repulsion. From some experiments with a steam engine
                    he concluded that water in being converted into steam under ordinary atmospheric
                    pressure expands to about 14,000 times its original volume instead of about 1G50
                    times as it actually does. Shortly after the above-mentioned letter was written,
                    Desaguliers, in “An Essay on the Cause of the Rise of Vapours and Exhalations in
                    the Air” <hi rend="italic">(Natural Philosophy,</hi> pt. ii.), attributed the
                    repulsion between the particles of vapour to an electrical action, supposing
                    that the particles of water were first electrified from the air and then
                    repelled by the air and by one another.</p>
                <p>In 1783 De Saussure published his <hi rend="italic">Essais sur</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Hygrométrie,</hi> which give an
                    account of many experiments executed on a great scale, and in some cases leading
                    him to correct conclusions. By placing a known weight of dry potassic carbonate
                    in a large glass balloon filled with air and saturated with aqueous vapour, and
                    finding the increase in the weight of the carbonate produced by absorption, he
                    determined the amount of vapour originally present. By filling the balloon with
                    dry air, and suspending in it a piece of wet linen, he determined the amount of
                    the water which evaporated from the loss of weight experienced by the linen.
                    These experiments were repeated with the balloon filled with hydrogen and
                    carbonic anhydride, and with mixtures of these gases, and both methods led to
                    the same result, indicating that the amount of vapour wa3 the same, if the
                    temperature remained constant, whatever gas were present. The inferences he
                    derived from his experiments at different temperatures were not, however,
                    justifiable; nor is there any ground for his division of vapour into four
                    classes, viz., pure elastic vapour, dissolved elastic vapour, vesicular vapour,
                    and concrete vapour, the last of which really consists of liquid drops.</p>
                <p>Deluc <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1792) enunciated the theory that the
                    quantity of vapour which can exist in any space depends <hi rend="italic">only
                        on the temperature,</hi> and is independent of the presence of any other
                    vapour or gas with which it has no tendency to combine chemically, being always
                    the same as if nothing but the vapour occupied the space; and this he verified
                    by pla&lt;flug his hygrometer with a little water under the receiver of an
                    air-pump, and showing that the indications of the hygrometer were independent of
                    the pressure of the air. Deluc was the first to propose that the hygrometric
                    state of the air should be measured by the ratio of the amount of vapour
                    existing in it to that required to saturate it at the temperature it possesses.
                    A more convenient measure has been proposed by Balfour Stewart, viz., the
                    quantity of vapour associated with the unit of mass of dry air.</p>
                <p>But it is to Dalton that we are chiefly indebted for a clear statement of the
                    laws of evaporation. In his <hi rend="italic">Meteorological Essays</hi> (1793,
                    p. 134) he states that “evaporation and the condensation of vapour are not the
                    effects of chemical affinities, but aqueous vapour always exists as a fluid <hi
                        rend="italic">sui generis</hi> diffused amongst the rest of the aerial
                    fluids.” Thus water at 80° Fahr, is on the point of boiling under a pressure of
                    1Ό3 inches of mercury, and from this he concludes that in the presence of dry
                    air water at 80° Fahr, will evaporate “till the density of its vapour,
                    considered abstractedly, becomes ⅛⅛th of what it is under a pressure of 30
                    inches, and its temperature 212°.” This statement, though inaccurate inasmuch as
                    it takes no account of· the expansion of a given mass of steam at constant
                    pressure when its temperature is raised from 80° Fahr, to 212° Fahr., yet shows
                    that Dalton had discovered the true law of evaporation, and thoroughly
                    understood its applications. If we substitute pressure for density, the
                    statement becomes correct. Again, on page 201 of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Essays</hi> he states his conviction, as the result of experiments and
                    observations,</p>
                <p>“That <hi rend="italic">the vapour of water (and probably of most other liquids)
                        exists at all temperatures in the atmosphere, ami is capable of bearing any
                        known degree of cold without a total condensation, and that the vapour so
                        existing is one and the same thing as steam or vapour of</hi> 212° <hi
                        rend="italic">or upwards.</hi> The idea, therefore, that vapour cannot exist
                    in the open atmosphere at a lower temperature than 212°, unless chemically
                    combined therewith, I consider as erroneous; it has taken its rise from the
                    supposition that <hi rend="italic">air</hi> pressing upon <hi rend="italic"
                        >vapour</hi> condenses the vapour equally with <hi rend="italic">vapour</hi>
                    pressing tη&gt;on tfljrøwr,— a supposition we have no right to assume, and
                    winch, 1 apprehend, will plainly appear to be contradictory to reason and
                    unwarranted by facts; for when a particle of vapour exists between two particles
                    of air, let their equal and opposite pressures upon it be what they may, they
                    cannot bring it nearer to another particle of vapour, without which no
                    condensation can take place, all other circumstances being the same; and it has
                    never been proved that the vapour in a receiver from which all the air has been
                    exhausted is precipitated upon the admission of perfectly dry air. Hence, then,
                    we conclude, till the contrary can be proved, that <hi rend="italic">the
                        condensation of vapour exposed to the common air does not in any way depend
                        upon the pressure of the air.”</hi></p>
                <p>(The italics are Dalton’s.) In these remarks Dalton manifests a clear
                    appreciation of the true state of the case. In his experiments he aimed directly
                    at the root of the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n765/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0765-0730"/> matter, and the results at which he arrived
                    are perfectly conclusive within the errors of his experiments. _ First he
                    measured the pressure of a quantity of dry air kept at constant volume for every
                    degree on Fahrenheit’s scale between the freezing and boiling poiuts; then he
                    found the pressure of pure steam in contact with water for every degree through
                    the same range, and lastly the rate of increase of pressure of a quantity of air
                    kept at constant volume but in contact with water when the temperature varied.
                    The results showed that at each particular temperature the pressure of the air
                    saturated with vapour was exactly equal to that corresponding to the dry air
                    together with that exerted by vapour alone when in contact with water at the
                    same temperature; from which he inferred that there is either no chemical action
                    between the air and vapour, or such action in no way affects the question at
                    issue with gases other than air and vapours other than aqueous. This conclusion
                    is frequently expressed by saying that gases and vapours behave to one another
                    as vacua. Most of these experiments were published in a paper in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Manchester Memoirs,</hi> vol. v.</p>
                <p>Dalton was the first to give a table of the maximum pressure of steam for
                    temperatures from 80° to 212° Fahr.</p>
                <p>The researches of Desormes, Gay Lussac, and Daniell all tend to corroborate
                    Dalton’s theory and the accuracy of hi3 experiments, the results of which may be
                    summed up in two statements, sometimes cited as Dalton’s laws, viz. :—</p>
                <p>I. In a space which contains a liquid and its vapour only, the liquid will
                    continue to evaporate until the pressure of its vapour attains a determinate
                    amount dependent only on the temperature.</p>
                <p>II. In a space containing dry air or other gas or gases a liquid will continue to
                    evaporate until the pressure exerted <hi rend="italic">by its vapour alone</hi>
                    is the same as if no air or other gas were present.</p>
                <p>The more recent researches of Regnault and Andrews have shown that the second law
                    is not quite true. It was, however, a great step in advance, and is sufficiently
                    accurate for all the purposes of chemical analysis and hygrometry. Two or more
                    vapours will act towards one another as vacua when, aud only when, their liquids
                    have no affinity for one another. When this is not the case, the pressure
                    exerted by the vapour above the surface of the mixed liquids is frequently much
                    less than that which can be exerted by the vapour of the more volatile liquid
                    alone. Thus sulphuric acid will absorb aqueous vapour, and alcohol will absorb
                    ether vapour, reducing the pressure to a small fraction of that exerted by the
                    ether vapour alone. Bisulphide of carbon and paraffin oil also diminish the
                    pressure of ether vapour. Since a mixture of liquids may boil when the pressure
                    of the vapour produced exceeds that to which the liquid is exposed, it follows
                    that a mixture of liquids which have no tendency to dissolve one another will
                    boil at a temperature below the boiling-point of either of them; but when the
                    liquids have an affinity for each other the boiling-point of the mixture will be
                    above that of the more volatile constituent.</p>
                <p>Γhe method employed by Gay Lussac for the measurement of the pressure of aqueous
                    vapour at low temperatures has not since been improved upon. He employed a
                    barometer tube whose length was considerably greater than the height of the
                    barometer, and having bent the upper portion (above the mercury) over so as to
                    slope downwards at an angle of about 60° with the horizon, he immersed the
                    closed end in a cold mixture at the temperature for which the pressure was to be
                    measured, and injected a little water into the barometer tube. The vapour
                    produced condensed in the cold part of the tube, and this process of
                    distillation continued until the whole of the water had evaporated from the
                    surface of the mercury, leaving it free to rise and fall in the tube. The
                    pressure of the vapour was afterwards always that due to the temperature of the
                    coldest part of the tube, for if at any time it exceeded this pressure,
                    condensation would commence and continue until the pressure was reduced to this
                    amount. A barometer tube dipping into the same trough of mercury, and containing
                    no water, was placed by the side of the experimental tube, and the difference in
                    the level of the mercury in the tubes was read by means of a microscope sliding
                    on a graduated pillar, this difference obviously indicating the pressure of the
                    vapour.</p>
                <p>The rate at which evaporation takes place has been the subject of much inquiry.
                    In 1772 Dr Dobson of Liverpool <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> lxvii.)
                    placed a cylindrical vessel, 12 inches in diameter, by the side of a rain-gauge,
                    and, allowing for the rain which fell into it, determined the total evaporation
                    during each month for four years. Dalton and Hoyle imitated more closely the
                    conditions presented by the soil, and filled a vessel three feet in depth with
                    gravel and sand, covering it with earth and sinking it in the ground; a pipe was
                    placed near the top and one near the bottom in order to collect any water which
                    might be free to run off, while the amount of rain received was measured by a
                    rain-gauge placed close to the vessel. At the commencement of the series of
                    observations the contents of the vessel were saturated with water, and the
                    difference between the amount of rain received and of water that escaped by the
                    pipes indicated the amount of evaporation.</p>
                <p>From observations of the rate of evaporation of water contained in a shallow tin
                    dish Dalton concluded that at different temperatures in calm air the rate of
                    evaporation is proportional to the maximum pressure of steam at that
                    temperature, diminished by the pressure of the vapour already existing in the
                    air, which pressure is determined from an observation of the dew-point, and that
                    when the air is in motion the rate of evaporation increases with the velocity of
                    the wind. It really depends not only on the temperature, but on the rate at
                    which the vapour can escape from the neighbourhood of the liquid, and
                    evaporation therefore proceeds more quickly when the pressure of the air is
                    diminished. Some considerations on the subject will be found in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Diffusion.</hi></p>
                <p>Many of Dalton’s experiments were subsequently repeated in a modified form by
                    Daniell, who examined the pressure of steam at various temperatures, and in the
                    presence of other gases, as well as the rate of evaporation. The chief monument
                    of Daniell’s work on this subject is his dewpoint instrument. Hutton was the
                    first to suggest the determination of the hygrometric state of the air from the
                    cold produced by evaporation; and Sir John Leslie employed the same method, in
                    connexion with the differential thermometer. For the theory of Mason’s dry and
                    wet bulb thermometers, or, as it is sometimes called, August’s psychrometer, see
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Diffusion.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1823 the determination of the maximum pressure of aqueous vapour at different
                    temperatures was referred to a commission of the Academy of Paris, and the work
                    was undertaken by Dulong and Arago, <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> 1hey measured
                    the pressure of steam at temperatures ranging from 100 C. to 224° C., by
                    observing the compression of a quantity of air imprisoned by mercury in a tube.
                    About the same time a committee of the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania
                    measured the temperature of steam in contact with water, at pressures varying
                    from one to ten atmospheres; but the results of the two series of experiments
                    did not agree very well. It was partly on this account that Regnault determined
                    to investigate the subject more thoroughly, ano it is to him we are indebted for
                    a table of the pressure o' aqueous vapour over a range of temperature varying
                    fron — 32° C. to 230° C. Some of his results, together witl <pb break="no"

                    publications of the Cavendish Society. The researches of Magnus, who arrived
                    independently at nearly the same results as Régnault, were published in <hi

                <p>Régnault also determined the density of aqueous vapour in air and in vacuo for
                    temperatures between 0° C. and 25° C., and concluded that when the pressure is
                    not very great nor the air nearly saturated (for when it is nearly saturated
                    there is probably deposition of moisture upon the glass vessels), the density
                    may be calculated from the known density of steam at the boiling-point and under
                    ordinary atmospheric pressure by supposing it to obey “the gaseous laws.”
                    According to Régnault the mass of a litre of dry air at 0° C., and under a
                    pressure of 760 millimetres of mercury, is 1^293187 grammes, and the density of
                    steam, compared with air at the same pressure and temperature as unity, is
                    ‘6235. Hence, by help of the table of pressures, the amount of aqueous vapour in
                    any given volume can be determined when we know the dewpoint and the temperature
                    of the air. If P denote the pressure of vapour at the dew-poiut in millimetres
                    of mercury, the mass of vapour in a litre of air at <hi rend="italic">V</hi> C.

                <p>A curve which represents the relation between the pressure and volume of the unit
                    mass of steam in contact with water as the temperature changes is called the <hi
                        rend="italic">steam line,</hi> and the corresponding curve for aqueous
                    vapour in contact with ice is called the <hi rend="italic">hoar-frost line.</hi>
                    Since water can be cooled below the freezing-point without solidifying, it is
                    possible to obtain data for drawing the steam line corresponding to a range of
                    temperature below 0° C. This Régnault did, and his results showed that the steam
                    line so continued does not coincide with the hoar-frost line, but that the two
                    intersect very obliquely just above the freezing-point. Régnault supposed that
                    this must be due to errors of measurement, and drew his steam line so as to
                    coincide with the hoar-frost line; but it has since been shown from theoretical
                    considerations, by James Thomson, that such a difference must exist, and that
                    the point ot intersection of the two curves corresponds to a particular relation
                    between the pressure, volume, and temperature for which ice, water, and steam
                    can all exist together in equilibrium, no other gas or vapour being present in
                    the inclosure. On examining Regnault’s results, the intersection of the curves
                    was found to be distinctly indicated by them. At this point the steam line, ice
                    line, and hoar-frost line intersect, and it has therefore been called the triple
                    point. The corresponding temperature is a little above.0 <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>The number of units of heat absorbed by the unit of mass of a substance, in
                    passing from the solid or liquid into the gaseous condition, without change of
                    temperature, is called the <hi rend="italic">latent heat of vaporization.</hi>
                    According to Andrews, the lateut heat of steam at 100° C. is 535 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9, or a gramme of water in being converted into
                    steam at 100° C. would absorb sufficient heat to raise 535 9 grammes from 0’ to
                    1° C.</p>
                <p>Soon after Dr Black enunciated his theory of latent heat, James Watt examined the
                    latent heat of steam produced at different temperatures, and concluded that,
                    when added to the amount of heat required to raise the unit of mass of water
                    from 0° C. to the temperature at which the steam is formed, the result, often
                    called the <hi rend="italic">total heat of steam,</hi> is the same for all
                    temperatures. This statement is known as Watt’s law, but is far from true, for
                    Régnault has shown experimentally that when steam is produced at a temperature
                    of <hi rend="italic">P</hi> C. its total heat is represented by 606 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 + <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 305i within
                    the limits of error of his experiments. Putting <hi rend="italic">t</hi> equal
                    to 100, this formula gives for the total heat of steam at 100° C. the value 637,
                    and its latent heat is therefore about 536, since about 101 units of heat are
                    required to raise the unit mass of water from 0° C. to 100° C. At 0° C. the
                    latent heat of steam is 606 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5. The latent heat of
                    steam is greater than that of any other known vapour. According to Favre and
                    Silbermann, the latent heat of the vapours of alcohol and ether are 208 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 31 and 91’11 respectively; and according to

                    liquids are frequently employed for the purpose of producing cold. The
                    cryophorus of Wollaston consists of a glass tube with a bulb at each end, one of
                    which is partially filled with water. The air is removed by boiling the water
                    and sealing the tube when full of steam. On turning all the water into one bulb,
                    and placing the other in a mixture of pounded ice and salt, the pressure of
                    vapour will be diminished by condensation taking place in the cold bulb, and
                    this allows such rapid evaporation to take place in the other bulb that the
                    water remaining in it becomes readily frozen. Gay Lussac showed that water
                    placed in a vacuum at 8° C., or in perfectly dry air at 2° C., may be frozen by
                    evaporation. The action of Carré’s freezing-machine depends upon the heat
                    absorbed by the rapid evaporation of ammonia, which has been liquefied by
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>Solid carbonic anhydride dissolved in ether will produce by evaporation <hi
                        rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> a temperature of about - 110° C., and Natterer,
                    by means of a mixture of liquid nitrous oxide and bisulphide of carbon
                    evaporating in vacuo, obtained a temperature which he estimated at - 140° C.</p>
                <p>When a vapour passes into the liquid or solid state a quantity of heat is
                    produced equal to that absorbed in evaporating at the same temperature. Thus, if
                    a gramme of steam be made to pass iuto 5’36 grammes of water at 0°, it will
                    raise the temperature of the water almost to 100° C., and if steam at 100° C. be
                    blown into a saturated solution of common salt, the temperature will rise to
                    109’ C. before the steam will pass freely through it.</p>
                <p>In 1822 Cagniard de la Tour inclosed a quantity of alcohol in a strong tube, so
                    as to occuDy about two-fifths of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n767/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0767-0732"/> its volume. A pellet of mercury was employed
                    to separate the alcohol from some air, the compression of which served to
                    measure the pressure in the tube. On heating the alcohol to about 225° C.
                    (according to De la Tour) it expanded to about twice its volume, and then
                    suddenly disappeared, the pressure being (according to the same authority) about
                    129 atmospheres. When the quantity of alcohol filled a much greater portion of
                    the tube, the tube burst. The experiment was repeated with ether, naptha, and
                    water, with similar-results; but in the case of water it was necessary to add a
                    little sodic carbonate to prevent the water dissolving the glass. The
                    experiments have since been repeated by Faraday, and still more recently by
                    Andrews. It was first noticed by Wolf <hi rend="italic">{Ann.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de Chimie,</hi> xlix. 230), afterwards by Drion <hi
                        rend="italic">{Ann.</hi><hi rend="italic">de Chimie,</hi> lvi. 221), who
                    examined Wolf’s results, experimenting with ether, and with ethylic chloride,
                    and subsequently by Andrews, that the curvature of the surface of the liquid
                    decreases as the temperature is raised, indicating a diminution in the surface
                    tension, while the surface itself becomes less strongly marked, till it entirely
                    loses its curvature, and then vanishes altogether, only a flickering hazy
                    appearance being visible in different parts of the tube. The temperature at
                    which the liquid and gaseous states merge into one another has been called by
                    Andrews the <hi rend="italic">critical point.</hi> Mçndeleef calls it the <hi

                <p>According to Drion, the critical points of ether, ethylic chloride, and
                    sulphurous anhydride are 190 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5 C., 184° C., and
                    157° C. respectively. Wolf experimented upon the diminution of the surface
                    tension of ether, water, and other liquids in capillary tubes, and finding it
                    diminish uniformly as the temperature increased between 0° C. and 100° C., he
                    calculated the temperatures at which the surface tension would entirely vanish,
                    and obtained 217° C. for ether and 537° C. for water.</p>

                    taking into account the mutual attraction of the molecules and the volume
                    occupied by the molecules themselves, has arrived at an equation which
                    represents in a somewhat rough manner the relation between the volume,
                    temperature, and pressure of a substance. When the pressure and temperature are
                    given, there are generally three roots representing the volume in the liquid,
                    gaseous, and unstable states respectively. At the critical point these three
                    roots become equal.</p>
                <p>From the values of the volume and pressure of water and steam at 0°, 100°, and
                    200° C., as deduced by Rankine from the observations of Régnault, Clerk Maxwell
                    has calculated that the critical temperature for water should be about 434° C.,
                    the critical pressure about 378 atmospheres, and the critical volume about 2 <hi

                <p>Dr Andrews has constructed an apparatus for the liquefaction of carbonic
                    anhydride, in which the gas is contained in a thermometer tube whose lower
                    portion is much wider than the upper part, and immersed in mercury contained in
                    a test tube, which is placed in a copper cylinder filled with water, to which
                    pressure is applied by inserting a steel screw. The lower end of the glass tube
                    is open, "and the upper part projects beyond the copper cylinder. If the
                    carbonic anhydride be heated beyond the critical point, pressure being applied
                    so as to keep some of the substance liquid until the critical point is reached,
                    and if the gas be then allowed to cool under this pressure, it will pass
                    continuously into the liquid state without any change in the nature of the
                    contents of the tube being apparent. On relieving the pressure the liquid will
                    boil.</p>
                <p>By the simultaneous application of cold and pressure Faraday succeeded in
                    reducing to the liquid state all known gases except hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
                    nitric oxide, carbonic oxide, and marsh gas, and in solidifying many of them.
                    The cooling was effected by the evaporation in vacuo of solid carbonic anhydride
                    dissolved in ether, which produced a temperature of about - 110° C.; and by this
                    means carbonic anhydride, chlorine, nitrous oxide, ammonia, cyanogen, and some
                    other gases were liquefied by cold alone at atmospheric pressure. Faraday was of
                    opinion that — 110° C. is above the critical temperature of air, oxygen,
                    hydrogen, nitrogen, carbonic oxide, and marsh gas. Andrews subsequently reduced
                    air to of its volume at ordinary pressure and temperature by means of pressure
                    and the cold produced by the same freezing mixture as was employed by Faraday.
                    Hydrogen was reduced to <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-⅛- <hi rend="subscript">
                        σ</hi> ∙ of its volume, oxygen to - <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-∣ <hi

                        <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi>, but no liquefaction ensued.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of 1877 Cailletet, at Chatillon-sur-Seine, compressed air and
                    other so-called permanent gases in an apparatus very similar to that of Andrews,
                    but provided with a means of suddenly relieving the pressure. The compressed
                    gases were cooled to - 29° C., and the cold produced by the sudden expansion
                    when the pressure was relieved was so intense that in each case a liquid spray
                    was produced. About the same time Pictet, at Geneva, succeeded, not only in
                    liquefying all the gases which had previously resisted liquefaction, but also in
                    solidifying hydrogen, his method depending on the cold produced by expansion, as
                    in Cailletet’s experiment, but the compressed gases being cooled by him to a
                    much lower temperature before expansion than was employed by Cailletet.</p>
                <p>Some of the laws of evaporation admit of easy explanation, in accordance with the
                    dynamical theory of the constitution of bodies. When a particle of liquid in the
                    course of its wanderings reaches the bounding surface with more than a certain
                    normal velocity, it is able to pass through the surface and get quite clear of
                    the liquid, when it becomes a particle of gas or vapour. The number of particles
                    passing through a square centimetre of the surface from the liquid will depend
                    upon the velocity of the liquid particles, and therefore on the temperature of
                    the liquid, but it will be entirely independent of the condition of affairs
                    outside the liquid. Hence, the quantity of liquid which evaporates in a second
                    will not depend upon the pressures of any gases or vapours above the liquid, but
                    only on the temperature. Whenever a particle of vapour moves towards the surface
                    of the liquid and reaches it, it enters the liquid and is <hi rend="italic"
                        >condensed.</hi> The quantity of vapour so condensed in a second will depend
                    on the velocity of translation of the particles of vapour and the number of such
                    particles in each cubic centimetre of the-space above the liquid, but will not
                    be sensibly affected by the presence of particles of other gases or vapours in
                    the same space. As the density of the vapour increases, the number of particles
                    which enter the liquid per second will increase proportionally, and at length
                    will become equal to the number which leave it. When this is the case
                    evaporation appears to cease; but it is not a cessation of evaporation which
                    actually takes place, but an increase in the rate of condensation which produces
                    a condition of dynamical equilibrium. If there be a quantity of another gas
                    above the surface of the liquid, its presence will hinder the diffu-βion<pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n768/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0768-0733"/> of the vapour just formed, thus causing the
                    amount of vapour near the liquid to approach more nearly to the state of
                    saturation than would otherwise be the case, and thus the rate of condensation
                    will be increased and the apparent rate of evaporation diminished. Nevertheless,
                    we must conclude that the amount of vapour ultimately contained in each cubic
                    centimetre of the space above the liquid, when no further evaporation takes
                    place, will be the same as if no other gas or vapour were present, if we do not
                    consider the space actually occupied by the particles themselves, for the number
                    of particles prevented from entering the liquid by reflection from the foreign
                    gas or vapour, will be exactly equal to the number which after leaving the
                    liquid are reflected and caused to re-enter the liquid by the same means.</p>
