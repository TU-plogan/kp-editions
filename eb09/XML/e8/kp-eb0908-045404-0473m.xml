                <p><label type="entry">ENZIO</label>, king of Sardinia (1225-1272), who played a
                    great part in the conflict between the empire and the papacy in the first half
                    of the 13th century, was one of the natural sons of the emperor Frederick II. by
                    his mistress the beautiful Bianca Lancia. He was born at Palermo at the close of
                    the year 1225, the same year in which his father married as his second wife
                    Iolante of Jerusalem. His name is conjectured to be a corruption of the German
                    “Hans.” In his thirteenth year he fought by his father’s side against the
                    Lombards at the battle of Cortenuova; and in the following year (1238) the
                    emperor, in pursuance of his determination to recover for the empire various
                    territories claimed as fiefs of the Holy See, married Enzio to Adelasia, the
                    widowed heiress of Sardinia and Corsica, and at the same time conferred on him
                    the title of king of Sardinia. He also received the honour of knighthood from
                    his father. In May 1239 he was declared vicar imperial in the north of Italy,
                    and took command of the German and Saracen troops in the imperial army. From
                    this time Enzio was his father’s right hand in war. He at once entered the Mardi
                    of Ancona; and so formidable to the papacy were his achievements that the most
                    distinguished soldier-cardinal, John of Colonna, was sent against him. Before
                    the end of the year the pope, Gregory 1X., excommunicated Frederick and his son;
                    and a crusade against them was soon after preached. This beating of the “drum
                    ecclesiastic,” however, did not scare them from their purpose. In 1241 Enzio was
                    entrusted with the command of the fleet, and in this post he added to his
                    already high reputation by a victory over the Genoese. The pope having convoked
                    a council at Rome, the prelates were flocking to it in large numbers in defiance
                    of the emperor’s remonstrances and commands. They were conveyed on board a
                    number of Genoese galleys; aud this fleet Enzio, in conjunction with the Pisans,
                    encountered and defeated near Meloria (May 3). Three vessels were sunk and
                    nineteen captured. Amongst the captives were three cardinal-legates, and many
                    bishops aud archbishops. The booty taken was immense, and included the vast sums
                    of money which the notorious Cardinal Otho had just collected in England. The
                    prelates were all taken to Naples, and were kept in close confinement, bound
                    with silver chains in mockery. After the death of the pope (Λugqst) Enzio was
                    sent with a large army to aid his brother Conrad, king of the Romans, against
                    the invading Tatar hosts. By the victory won by the two brothers of the house of
                    Hohenstauffen, near the Delphos, an affluent of the Danube, Europe and
                    Christendom were finally delivered from the presence of these desolating hordes.
                    Enzio was afterwards sent into Lombardy, which was for several years the scene
                    of his chief exploits. In 1245 he was excommunicated with the emperor by Pope
                    Innocent IV. Two years later he besieged Parma, but was compelled to retire. He
                    soon <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n474/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0474-0455"/> after besieged Colonna. In 1249 he took the
                    castle of Arola, and on this occasion he sullied his fair fame by putting to
                    death more than a hundred Guelfs of Reggio who were taken prisoners there. At
                    the head of the Modenese, Enzio encountered the troops of Bologna, May 26, 1249,
                    at Fossalta, and was wounded and taken prisoner. He was consigned to perpetual
                    imprisonment, and nothing could move his captors to abate a jot of their rigour.
                    On one occasion he nearly succeeded in making his escape concealed in a cask,
                    but was recognized by his golden hair. “A captive at the age of twenty-four,”
                    says Dean Milman, “this youth, of beauty equal to his bravery,—the poet, the
                    musician, as well as the most valiant soldier and consummate captain,—pined out
                    twenty-three years of life, if not in a squalid dungeon, in miserable
                    inactivity.” Enzio was passionately loved by Lucia Biadagioli, a high-boni
                    maiden of Bologna, who was given to him as a companion; and she made several
                    unsuccessful attempts to restore him to freedom. He was the best-beloved sou of
                    the emperor, who would have given any sum for his ransom, and to whom the loss
                    of him was a life-long affliction. Nor was he less idolized by his followers for
                    his brave, honourable, and generous character as a leader in war. Enzio died in
                    confinement at Bologna, March 14, 1272. The Bolognese gave him a magnificent
                    funeral. His body was embalmed, robed in scarlet, and lay in state for some days
                    wearing a golden crown and sceptre. It was then buried in the church of St
                    Dominic, and a marble tomb was erected in memory of the hero. History, says
                    Mr'Kington <hi rend="italic">(Hist. of Frederick the Second,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    289), does not record a more sorrowful tale.</p>
