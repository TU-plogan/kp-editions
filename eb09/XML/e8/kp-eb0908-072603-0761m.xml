                    (1731-1805), a theological writer whose views gave rise to much controversy, was
                    born at Warrington, in Lancashire, April 21, 1731. At the age of seven he was
                    placed under the care of an uncle, vicar of Mitcham, in Surrey. At fourteen he
                    entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1749. In 1753 he
                    took his degree of Μ. A.; and, after being ordained, he officiated for several
                    years as curate at Mitcham. In 1768 he became vicar of South Mimms near Barnet;
                    and in November 1769 he was presented to the rectory of Tewkesbury, with which
                    he also held the vicarage of Longdon. In the course of his studies and inquiries
                    after truth he discovered what he thought important variance between the
                    teaching of the Church of England and that of the Bible, and he did not conceal
                    his convictions. He allowed himself in reading the service to alter or omit
                    phrases which seemed to him untrue, and in reading the Scriptures to <pb

                    which was offensive to many of his congregation. A crisis was brought on by his
                    sermon on the resurrection preached at Easter 1771; and in November 1773 a
                    prosecution was instituted against him in the Consistory Court of Gloucester. He
                    was charged with “depraving the public worship of God contained in the liturgy
                    of the Church of England, asserting the same to be superstitious and
                    unchristian, preaching, writing, and conversing against the creeds and the
                    divinity of our Saviour, and assuming to himself the power of making arbitrary
                    alterations in his performance of the public worship.” A protest was at once
                    signed and published by a large number of the parishioners against the
                    prosecution. The case was carried by appeal to the Court of Arches and the Court
                    of Delegates, and was ultimately quashed on merely technical grounds in 1777.
                    Meanwhile Evanson had made his views generally known by several publications. In
                    1772 appeared anonymously his <hi rend="italic">Doctrines of a Trinity and the
                    Incarnation of God, examined upon the Principles of Reason and Common
                    Sense.</hi> This was followed in 1777 by <hi rend="italic">A Letter to Dr Hurd,
                    Bishop of Worcester, wherein the Importance of the Prophecies of the Hew
                    Testament and the Nature of the Grand Apostasy predicted in them are
                    particularly and impartially considered.</hi> The author had before this time
                    retired to Longdon, leaving his curate in charge at Tewkesbury. In 1775 he was
                    appointed domestic chaplain to the solicitorgeneral, and at the close of 1777
                    heresigned both his livings, and retired to Mitcham. In 178G he married. He soon
                    after wrote some papers on the Sabbath, which brought him into controversy with
                    Dr Priestley, who published the whole discussion (1792). In the same year
                    appeared Evansou’s work entitled <hi rend="italic">The Dissonance of the four
                    generally received Evangelists,</hi> to which replies were published by Dr
                    Priestley and D. Simpson, M.A, (1793). Evanson rejected most of the books of the
                    New Testament as forgeries, and of the four gospels he accepted only that of St
                    Luke. In 1802 he published <hi rend="italic">Refections upon the State of
                    Religion in Christendom,</hi> in which he attempted to explain and illustrate
                    the mysterious foreshadowings of the Apocalypse. This he considered the most
                    important of his writings. Shortly before his death he completed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Second Thoughts on the Trinity,</hi> in reply to a work of the
                    bishop of Gloucester. The story of the life, investigations, and conflicts of
                    this heretical churchman of a hundred years ago is full of interest, especially
                    for its anticipations of some of the momentous discussions of the present day.
                    He died at Coleford, in Gloucestershire, September 25, 1805. A narrative of the
                    circumstances which led to the prosecution of Evanson was published by N.
                    Havard, the town-clerk of Tewkesbury.</p>
