                <p><label type="entry">ENGRAVING</label>. The verb <hi rend="italic">engrave</hi> is
                    an old French word adopted by the English language, in which it bears at the
                    present day but one signification, that of marking by incision. In old English
                    the word was used in other senses, with which we need not now trouble the
                    reader, and the verb <hi rend="italic">engraver</hi> in modern French, used for
                    a boat when she runs her keel into the beach or for a cart when its wheels stick
                    in the mud of a road or the sand of a river, is a different word, being derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">grève,</hi> the sands of sea or river, which comes from
                    the Provençal <hi rend="italic">grava,</hi> the bed of a torrent, and is nearly
                    related to the English <hi rend="italic">gravel.</hi> Our English verb <hi
                    rend="italic">to engrave</hi> belongs to a large family of words in many Western
                    languages, the Anglo-Saxon form <hi rend="italic">grafan</hi> being remarkable
                    for its similarity to the Greek γραφ∈tκ Littré affirms that the Latin words <hi
                    rend="italic">scribere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scrobs</hi> are also
                    etymologically related to the verb <hi rend="italic">graver,</hi> and it is
                    evident that there is a close connection between <hi rend="italic">scrobs,</hi>
                    a furrow, and the hollow cuttings produced by an engraver with his tools. The
                    <hi rend="italic">grave</hi> in which the dead are buried is also connected with
                    these words both by its meaning and its etymology. The idea of a furrow or
                    cutting is essential to engraving, much more essential than any artistic idea.
                    The rudest mark which is cut into the substance of anything is really an
                    engraving, whilst the most admirable drawing which does not cut into the surface
                    is not engraving at all. When Old Mortality deepened the inscriptions on the
                    tombstones of the Covenanters he was strictly doing engraver’s work, though of a
                    coarse kind. Iu like manner the peoples of remote antiquity who chiselled their
                    writing and drawing on slabs of stone, were in the strictest sense engravers,
                    though the connection between their rude performance and the refined workmanship
                    which is bestowed on a modern vignette may not at first sight be very obvious.
                    On the other hand, a lithograph is not an engraving, neither is a photograph,
                    nor a photographic autotype; but the applications of photography which are known
                    as <hi rend="italic">heliogravure</hi> and <hi rend="italic">photogravure</hi>
                    are really engraving, because in these processes the surface of the metal plate
                    is eaten into or lowered. For the same reason etching may be correctly included
                    under the generic term engraving, and an etcher is called iu French a <hi
                    rend="italic">graveur</hi><hi rend="italic">a Veaufoτte,</hi> an engraver by
                    means of acid.</p>
                <p>Engraving may then be defined as writing or drawing in; which the marks are
                    produced by removing a portion of I the substance on which the writing or
                    drawing is made, instead of by simply staining or discolouring it as ink and
                    lead pencil do, or covering it with an opaque or transparent pigment as in
                    oil-painting.</p>
                <p>The idea of multiplication by printing, or by casting (as in seal engraving), is
                    a mere accidental suggestion and not an essential part of the art. Engraving
                    preceded printing, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n455/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0455-0436"/> and is still much used without any connection
                    with printing, as in the chased ornamentation of silver plate, fire-arms,
                    jewellery, and other objects of luxury.</p>
                <p>It is our intention, in the present article, to confine ourselves strictly to
                    engraving a3 one of the fine arts. Its present position is almost universally
                    secondary to painting. The engraver, in the fine arts, is almost invariably
                    occupied in translating the works of painters, as by his intervention they can
                    afterwards, at least in translation, be widely disseminated by the press.</p>
                <p>There are several different varieties of engraving, the chief of which are—(1)
                    Line engraving on metal plates, usually of copper or steel, in which the line is
                    always incised; (2) Etching, usually on metal, in which the lines are corroded
                    by means of acid; (3) Mezzotint, in which there are no lines whatever, but only
                    shades produced by roughening the surface of the metal; and (4) Woodcut, in
                    which the lines which print black have to be left in relief, whilst the surface
                    round them is cut away.</p>
                <p>These primary technical conditions have an irresistible influence even upon the
                    mental qualities exhibited in the different kinds of engraving. Each kind is
                    favourable to certain mental states, and unfavourable to others, each being in
                    itself an artistic as well as a technical discipline. A line engraver will not
                    see or think like an etcher, nor an etcher like an engraver in mezzotint; and
                    the consequence of this difference is that the manner iu which a line has to be
                    cut has a great influence in determining the direction of artistic taste and
                    feeling. Nor is this influence confined to the engravers themselves. The
                    enormous multiplication of their works by printing makes engravers only second
                    to writers in their power over public taste, which they can refine or vitiate by
                    spreading refined or vulgar interpretations of pictures.</p>
                <p>There is no inherent reason why engraving should be used only to translate
                    painting. The early engravers were often original artists who worked out designs
                    of their own, but in course of time a commercial reason prevailed over
                    originality. It was found that a well-known picture assured the sale of an
                    engraving from it beforehand, whereas an engraving which stood entirely on its
                    own merits came into the world without advantages, and had its own way to make.
                    Besides this, the engraver who copied a picture saved himself all the trouble of
                    thinking out and composing the design, which he found ready to his hand. The
                    same reasons have prevailed against original etching in our own day. There has
                    been a great revival of etching during the last fifteen or twenty years,
                    especially on the Continent, and many artists have acquired very great skill in
                    this mode of engraving. It was hoped, at first, that they would employ their
                    skill upon original works, but the convenience, both of publishers and etchers,
                    soon led them to employ etching, as engraving had been employed before, almost
                    exclusively in translating pictures. We cannot but deplore this subordination of
                    engraving to painting; and when we recur to the great engravers of past times
                    who composed and invented their own works, it is with a feeling of regret that
                    they have left so very few successors.</p>
                <p>Although we mentioned the four chief kinds of engraving in the order of what is
                    usually considered to be their relative importance, putting line engraving in
                    the first place and woodcut in the last, this is not the chronological order of
                    their discovery. Woodcut is the oldest kind of engraving from which impressions
                    were printed, and must therefore be taken first in a paper of this kind, which
                    proposes to deal only with engraving for the press.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wood Engraving.</hi></p>
                <p>It is natural that wood engraving should have occurred first to the primitive
                    mind, because the manner in which woodcuts are printed is the most obvious of
                    all the kinds of printing. If a block of wood is inked with a greasy ink and
                    then pressed on a piece of paper, the ink from the block will be transferred at
                    once to the paper, on which we shall have a black patch exactly the size and
                    shape of the inked surface. Now, suppose that the simple Chinese who first
                    discovered this was ingenious enough to go a step further, it would evidently
                    occur to him that if one of the elaborate signs, each of which in his own
                    language stood for a word, were drawn upon the block of wood, in reverse, and
                    then the whole of the white wool sufficiently cutaway to leave the sign in
                    relief, an image of it might be taken on the paper much more quickly than the
                    sign could be copied with a camel-hair brush and Indian ink. No sooner had this
                    experiment been tried and found to answer than blockprinting was discovered, and
                    from the printing of signs to the printing of rude images of things, exactly in
                    the same manner, the step was so easy that it must have been made insensibly.
                    Wood engraving, then, is really nothing but that primitive block-cutting which
                    prepared for the printer the letters in relief now replaced by movable types,
                    and the only difference between a delicate modern woodcut and the rude letters
                    in the first printed books is a difference of artistic skill and knowledge. In
                    Chinese and Japanese woodcuts we can still recognize traditions of treatment
                    which come from the designing of their written characters. The main elements of
                    a Chinese or a Japanese woodcut, uninfluenced by European example, are dashing
                    or delicate outlines and markings of various thickness, exactly such as a clever
                    writer with the brush would make with his Indian ink or vermilion. Often we get
                    a perfectly black blot, exquisitely shaped and full of careful purpose, and
                    these broad vigorous blacks are quite in harmony with the kind of printing for
                    which wood engraving is intended.</p>
                <p>It has not hitherto been satisfactorily ascertained whether wood engraving came
                    to Europe from the East or was rediscovered by some European artificer. The
                    precise date of the first European woodcut is also a matter of doubt, but here
                    we have certain data which at least set limits to the possibility of error.
                    European wood engraving dates certainly from the first quarter of the 15th
                    century. It used to be believed that a cut of St Christopher, very rudely
                    executed, and dated 1423, was the Adam of all our woodcuts, but subsequent
                    investigations have shaken this theory. There is a cut in the Brussels library,
                    of the Virgin and Child surrounded by four saints, which is dated 1418, but the
                    composition is so very elegant and the drawing so refined and beautiful, that
                    one has a difficulty in believing the date, though it is received as authentic.
                    The Virgin and Child of the Paris library is without date, but is supposed,
                    apparently with reason, to be earlier than either of the two we have mentioned;
                    and M. Delaborde has proved that two cuts were printed in 1406. The Virgin and
                    Child at Paris may be taken as a good representative specimen of very early
                    European wood engraving. It is simple art, but not bad art. The forms are drawn
                    in bold thick lines and the black blot is used with much effect in the hollows
                    and recesses of the design. Beyond this there is no shading. Rude as the work
                    is, the artist has expressed exquisite maternal tendérness in the pressure of
                    the Virgin’s cheek to that of the Child, whilst the attitude of the Child
                    itself, with its foot in its hand and its arm round the mother’s neck, is most
                    true to nature, as is the pose of the other foot against the mother’s arm, and
                    also the baby-like bending and twisting of the legs. The Virgin is crowned, and
                    stands against a niche-like decoration with pinnacles as often seen iu
                    illuminated manuscripts. In the woodcut this architectural decoration is boldly
                    but effectively draw n. Here, then, we have real art already, art in which
                    appeared both vigour of style and tenderness of feeling.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0456-0437"/>
                <p>The very earliest wood engraving consisted of outlines and white spaces with
                    smaller black spaces, but shading is rare or absent. Before passing to shaded
                    woodcuts we may mention a kind of wood engraving practised in the middle of the
                    15th century by a French engraver, often called Bernard Milnet, though his name
                    is a matter of doubt, and by other engravers nearer the beginning of that
                    century. This method is called the <hi rend="italic">crible,</hi> a word for
                    which there is no convenient translation in English. It means, <hi rend="italic"
                    >riddled ιvith small holes,</hi> as a target may be riddled with small shot. The
                    effect of light and dark is produced in this kind of engraving by sinking a
                    great number of round holes of different diameters in the substance of the wood,
                    which, of course, all come white in the printing; it is, in short, a sort of
                    stippling in white. When a more advanced kind of wood engraving had become
                    prevalent the <hi rend="italic">crible</hi> was no longer used for general
                    purposes, but it was retained for the grounds of decorative wood engraving,
                    being used occasionally in borders for pages, in printers’ marks, and other
                    designs, which were survivals in black and white of the ancient art of
                    illuminating. Curiously enough, this kind of wood engraving, though long disused
                    for purposes of art, has of late years been revived with excellent effect for
                    scientific purposes. It is now the accepted method of illustration for
                    astronomical books. The black given by the untouched wooden block represents the
                    night sky, and the holes, smaller or larger, represent in white the stars and
                    planets of lesser or greater magnitude. The process is so perfectly adapted to
                    this purpose, being so cheap, rapid, and simple, that it will probably never be
                    superseded. The objections to it for artistic purposes are, however, so obvious
                    that they were soon perceived even by the untrained critical faculty of the
                    earlier workmen, who turned their attention to woodcut in simple black lines,
                    including outline and shading. In early work the outline is firm and very
                    distinct, being thicker in line than the shading, and in the shading the lines
                    are simple, without cross-hatchings, as the workmen found it easier and more
                    natural to take out a white line-like space between two parallel or nearly
                    parallel black lines than to cut out the twenty or thirty small white lozenges
                    into which the same space would have been divided by cross-hatchings. The early
                    work would also sometimes retain the simple black patch which we find in
                    Japanese woodcuts, for example, in the Christmas Dancers of Wohlgemuth all the
                    shoes are black patches, though there is no discrimination of local colour in
                    anything else. A precise parallel to this treatment is to be found in a Japanese
                    woodcut of the Wild Boar and Hare given by Aimé Humbert in his book on Japan, in
                    which the boar has a cap which is a perfectly black patch though all other local
                    colour is omitted. The similarity of method between Wohlgemuth and the Japanese
                    artist is so close that they both take pleasure in drawing thin black lines at a
                    little distance from the patch and following its shape like a border. In course
                    of time, as wood engravers became more expert, they were not so careful to spare
                    themselves trouble and pains, and then cross-hatchings were introduced, but at
                    first more as a variety to relieve the eye than as a common method of shading.
                    In the 16th century a simple kind of wood engraving reached such a high degree
                    of perfection that the best work of that time has never been surpassed in its
                    own way. We intend very shortly to render full justice to the highly developed
                    skill of modern wood engravers; but it is undeniable that in the 16th century
                    the art stood more on its own merits than it does now, respected itself more,
                    and affirmed itself without imitating other arts.</p>
                <p>Wood engraving in the 16th century was much more conventional than it is in the
                    present day, and this very conventionalism enabled it to express what it had to
                    express with greater decision and power. The wood engraver in those days was
                    free from many difficult conditions which hamper his modern successor. He did
                    not care in the least about aerial perspective, and nobody expected him to care
                    about it; he did not trouble his mind about local colour, but generally omitted
                    it, sometimes, however, giving it here and there, but only when it suited his
                    fancy. As for lightand shade, he shaded only when he wanted to give relief, but
                    never worked out anything like a studied and balanced effect of light-and-shade,
                    nor did he feel any responsibility about the matter. What he really cared for,
                    and generally attained, was a firm, clear, simple kind of drawing, conventional
                    in its indifference to the mystery of nature and to the poetic sentiment which
                    comes to us from that mystery, but by no means indifferent to fact, of a decided
                    and tangible kind. The wood engraving of the 16th century was a singularly
                    positive art, as positive as carving; indeed, most of the famous woodcuts of
                    that time might be translated into carved panels without much loss of character.
                    Their complete independence of pictorial conditions might be illustrated by many
                    examples. In Dürer’s Salutation the dark blue of the sky above the Alpine
                    mountains is translated by dark shading, but so far is this piece of local
                    colour from being carried out in the rest of the composition-that the important
                    foreground figures, with their draperies, are shaded as if they were statues in
                    plaster of Paris. Again, the sky itself is false in its shading, for it is
                    without gradation, but the shading upon it has a purpose, which is to prevent
                    the upper part of the composition from looking too empty, and the
                    conventionalism of wood engraving was so accepted in those days that the artist
                    could have recourse to this expedient in defiance alike of pictorial harmony and
                    of natural truth. In Holbein’s admirable series of small well-filled
                    compositions, the Dance of Death, the firm and matter-of-fact drawing is
                    accompanied by a sort of light-and-shade adopted simply for convenience, with as
                    little reference to natural truth as might be expected in a stained-glass
                    window. There is a most interesting series of little woodcuts drawn and engraved
                    in the 16th century by J. Amman as illustrations of the different handicrafts
                    and trades, and entitled The Baker, The Miller, The Butcher, and so on. Nothing
                    is more striking in this valuable series than the remarkable closeness with
                    which the artist observed everything in the nature of a hard fact, such as the
                    shape of a hatchet or a spade; but he sees no mystery anywhere—he can draw
                    leaves but not foliage, feathers but not plumage, locks but not hair, a. hill
                    but not a landscape. In the Witches’ Kitchen, a woodcut by Baldung Grün of
                    Strasburg, dated 1510, the steam rising from the pot is so hard that it has the
                    appearance of two trunks of trees denuded of their bark, and makes a pendant in
                    the composition to a real tree on the opposite side which does not look more
                    substantial. The clouds of steam round about the jet are like puddings. Nor was
                    this a personal deficiency in Baldung Grün. It was Dürer’s own way of engraving
                    clouds and vapour, and all the engravers of that time followed it. Their
                    conceptions were much more those of a carver than those of a painter. Dürer
                    actually did carve in high relief, and Grün’s Witches’ Kitchen might be carved
                    in the same manner without loss; indeed it has the appearance of an <hi
                    rend="italic">alto·rdievo</hi> with the ground tinted darker than the carvings.
                    When the engravers were rather draughtsmen than carvers, their drawing was of a
                    decorative character. For example, in the magnificent portrait of Christian III.
                    of Denmark by Jacob Binck, one of the, very finest examples of old wood
                    engraving, the face and beard are drawn with few lines and very powerfully, but
                    the costume is treated strictly as decoration, the lines of the patterns being
                    all given, with as little shading as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n457/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0457-0438"/> possible, and what shading there is is simple,
                    without cross-hatching.</p>
                <p>The perfection of simple wood engraving having been attained so early as the 16th
                    century, the art became extremely productive, and has been so ever since. During
                    the 17th and 18th centuries it still remained a comparatively severe and
                    conventional form of art, because the workmen shaded as much as possible either
                    with straight lines or simple curves, so that there was never much appearance of
                    freedom. Modern wood engraving is quite a distinct art, being based on different
                    principles, but between the two stands the work of an original genius, Bewick,
                    who cannot be overlooked. He was born in 1753, and died in 1828. Although
                    apprenticed to an engraver in 1767, he was never taught to draw, and got into
                    ways and habits of his own which add to the originality of his work, though his
                    defective training is always evident. His work is the more genuine from his
                    habit of engraving his own designs, which left him perfect freedom of
                    interpretation, but the genuineness of it is not only of the kind which comes
                    from independence of spirit, it is due also to his fidelity to the technical
                    nature of the process, a fidelity very rare in the art. The reader will remember
                    that in wood engraving every cutting print3 white, and every space left
                    untouched prints black. Simple black lines are obtained by cutting out white
                    lines or spaces between them, and crossed black lines have to be obtained by
                    laboriously cutting out all the white lozenges between them. In Bewick’s cuts
                    white lines are abundant and are often crossed, but black lines are never
                    crossed; he is also quite willing to utilize the black space, as the Japanese
                    wood engravers, and Dürer’s master Wohlgemuth used to do. The side of the
                    frying-pan in the vignette of the Cat and the Mouse is treated precisely on
                    their principles, so precisely indeed that we have the line at the edge for a
                    border. In the vignette of the Fisherman, at the end of the twentieth chapter of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Memoir,</hi> the space of dark shade under the bushes is
                    left quite black, whilst the leaves and twigs, and the rod and line too, are all
                    drawn in pure white lines. Bewick, indeed, was more careful in his adherence to
                    the technical conditions of the art than any of the primitive woodcutters except
                    those who worked in <hi rend="italic">crible</hi> and who used white lines a3
                    well as their dots. Such a thing as a fishing-net is an excellent test of this
                    disposition. In the interesting series by J. Amman illustrating the craftsand
                    trades of the 16th century, there is a cut of a man fishing in a river, from a
                    small punt, with a net. The net comes dark against the light surface of the
                    river, and Amman took the trouble to cut a white lozenge for every mesh. Bewick,
                    in one of his vignettes, represents a fisherman mending his nets by the side of
                    a stream. Along net is hung to dry on four upright sticks, but to avoid the
                    trouble of cutting out the lozenges, Bewick artfully contrives his arrangement
                    of light and shade so that the net shall be in light against a space of black
                    shade under some bushes. This permits him to cut every string of the net in
                    white, according to his practice of using the white line whenever he could. He
                    used it with great ability in the scales of his fish, but this was simply from a
                    regard to technical convenience, for when he engraved on metal he marked the
                    scales of his fish by black lines. These may seem very trifling considerations
                    to persons unacquainted with the fine arts, who may think that it can matter
                    little whether a fishing-net is drawn in black lines or in white, but the fact
                    is that the entire destiny of wood engraving has depended on preserving or
                    rejecting the white line. Had it been generally accepted as it was by Bewick,
                    original artists might have followed his example in engraving their own
                    inventions, because then wood engraving would have been a natural and
                    comparatively rapid art; but since the black line has been preferred the art has
                    become a handicraft, because original artists have not time to cut out thousands
                    of little white spaces. The reader may at once realize for himself the
                    tediousness of the process by comparing the ease with which one writes a page of
                    manuscript with the labour which would be involved in cutting away, with perfect
                    accuracy, every space, however minute, which the pen had not blackened with
                    ink.</p>
                <p>The two centuries in which wood engraving has developed itself most remarkably
                    are the 16th and the 19th. Wc have described the character of 16th century work,
                    which was easy, as the work of that time had a limited purpose and a settled
                    character. It may not appear so easy to describe the various and unsettled work
                    of our own time, but it Î3 animated by a leading idea, which is universality.
                    Wood engraving in the !9th century has no special character of its own, nothing
                    like Bewick’s work, which had a character derived from the nature of the
                    process; but on the other hand, the modern art is set to imitate every kind of
                    engraving and every kind of drawing. Thus we have woodcuts that imitate line
                    engraving, others that copy etching and even mezzotint, whilst others try to
                    imitate the crumbling touch of charcoal or of chalk, or the wash of
                    water-colour, or even the wash and the pen-line together. The art is put to all
                    sorts of purposes; and though it is not and cannot be free, it is made to
                    pretend to a freedom which the old masters would have rejected as an
                    affectation. Rapid sketches are made on the block with the pen, and the modern
                    wood engraver sets himself patiently to cut out all the spaces of white, in
                    which case the engraver is in reality less free than his predecessor in the 16th
                    century, though the result has a false appearance of liberty. The woodcut is
                    like a polyglot who has learned to speak many other languages at the risk of
                    forgetting his own. And, wonderful as may be its powers of imitation, it can
                    only approximate to the arts which it imitates; it can never rival each of them
                    on its own ground. It can convey the idea of etching or water-colour, but not
                    their quality; it can imitate the manner of a line engraver on steel, but it
                    cannot give the delicacy of his line3. Whatever be the art which the wood
                    engraver imitates, a practised eye sees at the first glance that the result is
                    nothing but a woodcut. Therefore, although we may admire the suppleness of an
                    art which can assume so many transformations, it is certain that these
                    transformations give little satisfaction to severe judges. We are bound,
                    however, to acknowledge that in manual skill and in variety of resource modern
                    wood engravers far excel their predecessors. A Belgian wood engraver, Stéphane
                    Pannemaker, exhibited at the Salon of 1876 a woodcut entitled La Baigneuse,
                    which astonished the art-world by the amazing perfection of its method, all the
                    delicate modelling of a nude figure being rendered by simple modulations of
                    unbroken line. Both English and French publications abound in striking proofs of
                    skill. The modern art, as exhibited in these publications, may be broadly
                    divided into two sections, one depending upon line, in which case the black line
                    of a pen sketch is carefully preserved, and the other depending upon tone, when
                    the tones of a sketch with the bru^b are translated by the wood engraver into
                    shades obtained in his own way by the burin. The first of these methods requires
                    extreme care, skill, and patience, but makes little demand upon the intelligence
                    of the artist; the second leaves him more free to interpret, but he cannot do
                    this rightly without understanding both tone and texture. The wood-cuts in
                    Doré’s <hi rend="italic">Don Qτιixote</hi> are done by each method alternately,
                    many of the designs having been sketched with a pen upon the block, whilst
                    others are shaded with a brush in Indian ink and white, the latter being
                    engraved by interpreting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n458/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0458-0439"/> the shades of the brush. In the pen drawings the
                    lines are Doré’s, in the brush drawings the lines are the engraver’s. In the
                    night scenes M. Pisan has usually adopted Bewick’s system of white lines, the
                    block being left untouched in its blackness wherever the effect permitted.
                    Modern English wood engraving shows to great advantage in such newspapers as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London Nezes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Graphic,</hi> the best of their kind in the world, and also in vignettes for
                    book illustration, which English artists usually execute with delicacy and
                    taste. A certain standard of vignette engraving was reached by Mr Edmund Evans
                    in Mr Birket Foster’s edition of Cowper’s <hi rend="italic">Task,</hi> which is
                    not likely to be surpassed in its own way, either for delicacy of tone or for
                    careful preservation of the drawing. An important extension of wood engraving in
                    modern times has been due to the invention of compound blocks. Formerly a
                    woodcut was limited in size to the dimensions of a block of boxwood cut across
                    the grain, except in the primitive condition of the art, when commoner woods
                    were used in the direction of the grain; but in the present day many small
                    blocks are fitted togther so as to form a single large one. They can be
                    separated or joined together again at will, and it is this facility which has
                    rendered possible the rapid production of large cuts for the newspapers, as many
                    cutters work on the same subject at once, each taking his own section.</p>
                <p>The process of modern wood engraving may be briefly described as follows. The
                    surface of the block is lightly whitened with Chinese white so as to produce a
                    light yellowish grey tint, and on this the artist draws either with a pen if the
                    work is intended to be in line, or with a hard pointed pencil and a brush if it
                    is intended to be in shade. If it is to be a line woodcut the cutter simply digs
                    out the whites with a sharp burin or scalpel (he has these tools of various
                    shapes and sizes), and that is all he has to do; but if the drawing on the wood
                    is shaded with a brush, then the cutter has to work upon the tones in such a
                    manner that they will come relatively true in the printing. This is by no means
                    easy, and the result is often a disappointment, besides which the artist’s
                    drawing is destroyed in the process, so that it is now customary to have the
                    block photographed before the engraver touches it, when the drawing is specially
                    worth preserving. This was done for Mr Leighton’s illustrations to <hi
                    rend="italic">Romolα.</hi><hi rend="italic">Copper and Steel Plate
                    Engraving.</hi></p>
                <p>Engraving on plates of copper and steel is the converse of wood engraving in
                    method. In line engraving it is the line itself which is hollowed, whereas in
                    the woodcut, as we have seen, when the line is to print black it is left in
                    relief, and only white spaces and white lines are hollowed. There was no
                    difficulty about discovering the art of line engraving, which has been practised
                    from the earliest ages. The prehistoric Aztec hatchet given to Humboldt in
                    Mexico was just as really and truly <hi rend="italic">engraved</hi> as a modern
                    copperplate with outlines after Flaxman or Thorwaldsen; the Aztec engraving is
                    of course ruder than the European, but it is the same art. The important
                    discovery which made line engraving one of the multiplying arts was the
                    discovery how to print an incised line, which would not occur to every one, and
                    which in fact was hit upon at last by accident, and known for some time before
                    its real utility was suspected. Line engraving in Europe does not owe its origin
                    to the woodcut, but to the chasing on goldsmiths’ work. If the reader will look
                    at any article of jewellery in which the metal is ornamented with incised
                    designs, he will there see the true origin of our precious Dürers and
                    Marcantonios. The history of the first plateprinting is as follows. The
                    goldsmiths of Florence in the middle of the 15th century were in the habit of
                    ornamenting their works by means of engraving, after which they filled up the
                    hollows produced by the burin with a black enamel made of silver, lead, and
                    sulphur, the result being that the design was rendered much more visible by the
                    opposition of the enamel and the metal. An engraved design filled up in this
                    manner was called a <hi rend="italic">niello,</hi> and our modern door-plates
                    are really <hi rend="italic">nielli</hi> also, for in them too the engraved
                    lines are filled with black. The word comes from <hi rend="italic"
                    >nigellum,</hi> and simply refers to the colour of the enamel. Whilst a niello
                    was in progress the artist could not see it so well as if the enamel were
                    already in the lines, and on the other hand, he did not like to put in the hard
                    enamel prematurely, as when once it was set it could not easily be got out
                    again. He therefore took a sulphur cast of his niello in progress, on a matrix
                    of fine clay, and filled up the lines in the sulphur with lampblack, thus
                    enabling himself to judge of the state of his engraving. At a later period it
                    was discovered that a proof could be taken on damped paper by filling the
                    engraved lines with a certain ink and wiping it off the surface of the plate,
                    sufficient pressure being applied to make the paper go into the hollowed lines
                    and fetch the ink out of them. This was the beginning of plate printing, but
                    nobody at first suspected the artistic and commercial importance of the
                    discovery. The niello engravers thought it a convenient way of proving their
                    work, as it saved the trouble of the sulphur cast, but they saw no further into
                    the future. They went on engraving nielli just the same to ornament plate and
                    furniture; nor was it until the next century that the new method of printing was
                    carried out to its great and wonderful results. Even in our own day the full
                    importance of it is only understood by persons who have made the fine arts a
                    subject of special study. There are, however, certain differences between plate
                    printing and block printing which afl'ect the essentials of art. When paper is
                    driven <hi rend="italic">into</hi> a line so as to fetch the ink out of it, the
                    line may be of unimaginable fineness, it will print all the same; but when the
                    paper is only pressed <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> a raised line, the line must
                    have some appreciable thickness, so that the wood engraving can never be so
                    delicate as plate engraving. Again, not only does plate printing excel block
                    printing in delicacy; it excels it also in force and depth. There never was, and
                    there will never be, a woodcut line having the power of a deep line in a plate,
                    for in block printing the line is only a blackened surface of paper, whereas in
                    plate printing it is a <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> with an additional thickness
                    of printing ink.</p>
                <p>Having limited ourselves in this article to engraving for ’the press, we do not
                    stay to enumerate the niello engravers, but pass at once to the art of line
                    engraving for prints; and first let us describe the process, which is as simple
                    in theory as it is difficult in practice. The most important of the tools used
                    is the burin, which is a bar of steel with one end fixed in a handle rather like
                    a mushroom with one side cut away, the burin itself being shaped so that the
                    cutting end of it when sharpened takes the form of a lozenge. Burins are made in
                    many varieties to suit individual tastes and the different uses to which they
                    are applied, but most burins resemble each other in presenting the shape of a
                    more or less elongated lozenge at the end where they are sharpened. The burin
                    acts exactly like a plough: it makes a furrow and turns out a shaving of metal
                    as the plough turns the soil of a field. The burin, however, is pushed while the
                    plough is pulled, and this peculiar character of the burin as a pushed
                    instrument at once establishes a wide separation between it and all the other
                    instruments employed in the arts of design, such as pencils, brushes, pens, and
                    etching needles. The manual difficulty which has to be overcome by the engraver
                    is in making himself master of the burin, and in order to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0459-0440"/> accomplish this he is obliged to go through a
                    great deal of simply manual practice in cutting lines. The beginner learns to
                    cut straight lines and curves of various degrees of depth, and to cross them so
                    that the interstices may form squares, lozenges, triangles, &amp;c. These
                    exercises, after long practice, give a degree of manual skill which has been
                    often misemployed in ingenious trifling, to the detriment of true artistic
                    quality, so that laborious men have wasted their time in cutting patterns like
                    woven wire, and carefully inserting a dot in the middle of every lozenge or
                    square. Whilst avoiding this error, which has been the bane of engraving, the
                    student should train his hand and eye by copying portions of good prints
                    directly on the metal, as a modern engraver cannot work in ignorance of the
                    language of his art, though he may employ it in his own way afterwards. It is,
                    however, unfortunately true that set methods, which may be called the business
                    of engraving, have a tendency to become much more predominant than in the sister
                    art of painting, so that real originality expresses itself much less frequently
                    with the burin than with the brush.</p>
                <p>The elements of engraving with the burin upon metal will be best understood by an
                    example of a very simple kind, as in the engraving of letters. The capital
                    letter B contains in itself the rudiments of an engraver’s education. As at
                    first drawn, before the blacks are inserted, this letter consists of two
                    perpendicular straight lines and four curves, all the curves differing from each
                    other. Suppose, then, that the engraver has to make a B, he will scratch these
                    lines very lightly with a sharp point or style. The next thing is to cut out the
                    blacks (not the whites, as in wood engraving), and this would be done with two
                    different bnrins. The engraver would get his vertical black line by a powerful
                    ploughing with the burin between his two preparatory first lines, and then take
                    out some copper in the thickest parts of the two curves. This done he would then
                    take a finer burin and work out the gradation from the thick line in the midst
                    of the curve to the thin extremities which touch the perpendicular. When there
                    is much gradation in a line the darker parts of it are often gradually ploughed
                    out by returning to it over and over again. The hollows so produced are
                    afterwards filled with printing ink, just as the hollows in a niello were filled
                    with black enamel; the printing ink is wiped from the smooth surface of the
                    copper, damped paper is laid upon it, and driven into the hollowed letter by the
                    pressure of a rolling cylinder; it fetches the ink out, and you have your letter
                    B in intense black upon a white ground.</p>
                <p>When the surface of a metal plate is sufficiently polished to be used for
                    engraving, the slightest scratch upon it will print as a black line, the degree
                    of blackness being proportioned to the depth of the scratch. Most readers of
                    these pages will possess an engraved plate from which visiting cards are
                    printed. Such a plate is a good example of some elementary principles of
                    engraving. It contains thin lines and thick ones, and a considerable variety of
                    curves. An elaborate line engraving, if it is a pure line engraving and nothing
                    else, will contain only these simple elements in different combinations, The
                    real line engraver is always engraving a line more or less broad and deep in one
                    direction or another; he has no other business than this.</p>
                <p>We may now pass to the early Italian and early German prints, in which the line
                    is used with such perfect simplicity of purpose that the methods of the artists
                    are as legible as if we saw them actually at work.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be well to say something here about
                    the accessibility of examples. Any one living in London can study engraving at
                    its sources to the fullest extent in fine impressions belonging to that
                    little-appreciated treasure-house, the print-room of the British Museum, but the
                    difficulty is for students who live in the provinces or in distant colonies.
                    This difficulty has been overcome of late years by the perfection to which Μ.
                    Amand Durand has brought the art of photographic engraving originally invented
                    by Niepce, and now called <hi rend="italic">héliogravure.</hi> By means of this
                    a new plate can be produced from an impression of an old engraving without
                    touching the print, and so perfect that the impressions yielded by the new plate
                    can only be distinguished from old prints by an expert, and not always with
                    certainty by him, so that they have to be marked on the back to prevent fraud.
                    Μ. Amand Durand has made it his principal business to reproduce engravings by
                    the old masters; so that the provincial or colonial student may now possess in
                    his own cabinet a selection of the best examples. One thing only it is necessary
                    for him to bear in mind. There are two sorts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >héliogravure,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> that which prints like a
                    copper-plate and that which prints like a woodcut. Both are used for book
                    illustration, and indiscriminately, so that the student will often meet with a
                    plateengraving which lias been reproduced to print like a woodcut, and whenever
                    he does so he ought not to pay the slightest attention to it, for no
                    plate-engraving can ever be reproduced as a woodcut without the loss of its
                    finest technical qualities. A plate so reproduced will no doubt retain its
                    composition and expression, though even the expression may often lose a little
                    from the greater coarseness of the lines; but all its quality as workmanship,
                    all the delicacy of the manual art, is sacrificed, merely that it may be printed
                    more cheaply. 'Γhe student should therefore resolutely turn away from all <hi
                    rend="italic">typographic</hi> héliogravures after engraved plates, and confine
                    his attention to those which are printed as the original plates were printed, a
                    matter which he can easily ascertain for himself by seeing that there is a plate
                    mark, the colourless mark produced by the edges of the plate upon the paper. Μ.
                    Amand Durand has published many copies from engravings by dif · ferent old
                    masters, including complete sets from the original works of Vandyke, Paul
                    Potter, Claude, and Albert Dürer. Such reproductions as these are really
                    available for purposes of study, but the quantitj∙ of different photographic
                    processes invented of late years has inundated the market with the most various
                    kinds of more or less defective reproductions, which the student ought carefully
                    to avoid. And however perfect the process may be, all reproductions <hi
                    rend="italic">on a reduced scale</hi> should be rejected at once by students,
                    for the manner of working adopted bj <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> a true
                    master depends always upon the scale of his engraving. Dürer will put more into
                    a large plate than into a little one; and when a large plate by Dürer is reduced
                    by a photographic process, the reduction, by its microscopic abundance of
                    detail, conveys a false idea of Dürer’s practice as an artist. The reductions of
                    old engravings which are now’ so frequently used for book-illustrations arc more

                <p>The student may soon understand the spirit and technical quality of the earliest
                    Italian engraving by giving his attention to a few of the series which used
                    erroneously to be called the <hi rend="italic">Playing Cards of Mantegna.</hi>
                    “The series,” says Professor Colvin, “consists of fifty pieces, divided into
                    sets of ten each. Of these five sets, each is marked with an initial letter, A,
                    B, C, D, E, and every print of the series carries besides an Arabic numeral, 1,
                    2, 3, up to 50. Only the numerical order, which shows how the series is meant to
                    be arranged and studied, reverses the alphabetical order which corresponds with
                    the respective dignity of the subject; thus Nos. 1-10 are lettered as class E,
                    Nos. 11-20 as class D, and so on. This number, fifty, and this plan of
                    subdivision by tens, are quite inconsistent with the supposed destination of the
                    series as playing-cards; and so also are the subjects of the series. They
                    represent a kind of encyclopaedia of knowledge, proceeding upwards from earthly
                    to transcendental things,—first, the various orders and conditions of men;
                    secoud, the nine muses and Apollo; third, the seven liberal arts, with poetry,
                    theology, and philosophy added to complete the group of ten; fourth, the four
                    cardinal and three theological virtues, with three singular personifications or
                    geniuses added to complete ten —a genius of time, a genius of the sun, and a
                    genius of cosmos, the world; fifth, the planets, in their mythological,
                    astrological, and astronomical signification, with the three outer spheres added
                    to make up the ten—viz., the eighth, or sphere of the fixed stars, the Primum
                    Mobile, or inclosing sphere, which by its rotation imparts rotation to the rest
                    within, and the Prima Causa, or empyrean sphere, the nnrevolving abiding place
                    of Deity. The series is, therefore, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0460-0441"/> as the must recent critics have called it, a
                    moral and educational series, or instructive picture book.”</p>
                <p>We have not space to enter into the controversy about the origin of these
                    engravings. They are supposed to be Florentine; they are certainly Italian; and
                    their technical manner is called that of Baccio Baldini, of whose biography
                    nothing is known. But if the history of these engravings is obscure, their style
                    is as clear as a style can be. There is not room for a moment’s doubt about the
                    artist’s conception of his art. In all these figures the outline is the • main
                    thing, and next to that the lines which mark the leading folds of the drapery,
                    lines quite classical in purity of form and severity of selection, and
                    especially characteristic in this, that they are always really engraver's lines,
                    such as may naturally be done with the burin, and they never imitate the freer
                    line of the pencil or etching needle. As for shading, it is used in the greatest
                    moderation with thin straight strokes of the burin, that never overpower the
                    stronger organic lines of the design. Of chiaroscuro, in any complete sense,
                    there is none. The sky behind the figures is represented by white paper, and the
                    foreground is sometimes occupied by flat decorative engraving, much nearer in
                    feeling to calligraphy than to modern painting. Sometimes there is a cast
                    shadow, but it is not studied, and is only used to give relief. We may observe
                    that in this early metal engraving the lines are often crossed in the shading,
                    whereas in the earliest woodcuts they are not; the reason being that when lines
                    are incised they can as easily be crossed as not, whereas, when they are
                    reserved, the crossing involves much labour of a non-artistic kind. Here, then,
                    we have pure line-engraving with the burin, that is, the engraving of the pure
                    line patiently studied for its own beauty, and exhibited in an abstract manner,
                    with care for natural form combined with inattention to the effects of nature.
                    Even the forms, too, are idealized, especially in the cast of draperies, for the
                    express purpose of exhibiting the line to better advantage. Such are the
                    characteristics of those very early Italian engravings which were attributed
                    erroneously to Mantegna. When we come to Mantegna himself we find a style
                    equally decided. Drawing and shading were for him two entirely distinct things.
                    He did not draw and shade at the same time, as a modern chiaroscurist would, but
                    he first got his outlines and the patterns on his dresses all very accurate and
                    right, and then threw a veil of shading over them, and a very peculiar kind of
                    shading it was, all the lines being straight and all the shading diagonal. This
                    is the primitive method, its peculiarities being due, not to a learned
                    self-restraint, but to a combination of natural genius with technical
                    inexperience, which made the early Italians at once desire and discover the
                    simplest and easiest methods. But whilst the Italians were shading with straight
                    lines the Germans had begun to use curves, and as soon as the Italiaus saw good
                    German work they abandoned their old stiff practice and tried to give to their
                    burins something of the German suppleness.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of early metal engraving in Germany are seen to perfection in
                    Martin Schongauer and Albert Durer, who, though with striking differences, had
                    many points in common. Schongauer was the earlier artist of the two, as he died
                    in 1188; whilst the date of Diirer’s death is 1528, just forty years later.
                    Schongauer was therefore a whole generation before Dürer, yet scarcely inferior
                    to him in the use of the burin, though Durer has a much greater reputation, due
                    in great measure to his singular imaginative powers. Schongauer is the first
                    great German engraver who is known to us by name, but he was preceded by an
                    unknown German master, whom we now call the master of 1166, who had Gothic
                    notions of art (in strong contrast to the classicism of Baccio Baldini), but
                    used the burin skilfully in his own way, conceiving of line and shade as
                    separate elements, yet shading with an evident desire to follow the form of the
                    thing shaded, and with lines in various directions. Schongauer’s art is a great
                    stride in advance, and we find in him an evident pleasure in the bold use of the
                    burin. Outline and shade, in Schongauer, are not nearly so much separated as in
                    Baccio Baldini, and the shading, generally in curved lines, is far more masterly
                    than the straight shading of Mantegna. Durer continued Schongauer’s curved
                    shading, with increasing manual delicacy and skill; and as he found himself able
                    to perform feats with the burin which amused both himself and his buyers, he
                    over loaded his plates with quantities of living and inanimate objects, each of
                    which he finished with as much care as if it were the most important thing in
                    the composition. The engravers of those days had no conception of any necessity
                    for subordinating one part of their work to another; they drew, like children,
                    first one object and theu another object, and so on until the plate was
                    furnished from top to bottom and from the left side to the right. Here, of
                    course, is an element of facility in primitive art which is denied to the modern
                    artist. In Dürer all objects are on the same plane. In his St Hubert, the stag
                    is quietly standing on the horse’s back, with one hoof on the saddle, and the
                    kneeling knight looks as if he were tapping the horse on the nose. Dürer seems
                    to have perceived the mistake about the stag, for he put a tree between us aud
                    the animal to correct it, but the stag is on the horse’s back nevertheless. This
                    ignorance of the laws of effect is least visible and obtrusive in plates which
                    have no landscape distances, such as The Coat of Arms with the Death’s Head and
                    The Coat of Arms with the Cock. Dürer’s great manual skill and close observation
                    made him a wonderful engraver of objects taken separately. He saw and rendered
                    all objects; nothing escaped him; he applied the same intensity of study to
                    everything. Though a thorough student of the nude (witness his Adam and Eve, and
                    other plates), he would pay just as much attention to the creases of a gaiter as
                    to the development of a muscle; and though man was his main subject, he would
                    study dogs with equal care (see the five dogs in the St Hubert), or even pigs
                    (see the Prodigal Son); and at a time when landscape painting was unknown he
                    studied every clump of trees, every visible trunk and branch, nay, every
                    foreground plant, and each leaf of it separately. In his buildings he saw every
                    brick like a bricklayer, and every joint in the woodwork like a carpenter. The
                    immense variety of the objects which he engraved was a training in suppleness of
                    hand. His lines go in every direction; and are made to render both the
                    undulations of surfaces (see the plane in the Melancholia) aud their texture
                    (see the granular texture of the stones in the same print).</p>
                <p>From Dürer we come to Italy again, through Marc antonio, who copied Dürer,
                    translating more than sixty of his woodcuts upon metal. It is one of the most
                    remarkable things in the history of art, that a man wdιo had trained himself by
                    copying northern work, little removed from pure Gothicism, should have become
                    soon afterwards the great engraver of Raphael, who was much pleased with his
                    work and aided him by personal advice. Yet, although Raphael was a painter, and
                    Marcantonio his interpreter, the reader is not to infer that engraving had as
                    yet subordinated itself to painting. Raphael himself evidently considered
                    engraving a distinct art, for he never once set Marcantonio to work from a
                    picture, but always (much more judiciously) gave him drawings, which the
                    engraver might interpret without going outside of his own art; consequently
                    Marcantonio’s works are always genuine engravings, and are never pictorial.
                    Marcantonio was an engraver of remarkable power. Tn him the real <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0461-0442"/> pure art of line-engraving reached its maturity.
                    He retained much of the early Italian manner in his backgrounds, where its
                    simplicity gives a desirable sobriety; but his figures are boldly modelled in
                    curved lines, crossing each other in the darker shades, but left single in the
                    passages from dark to light, and breaking· away in fine dots as they approach
                    the light itself, which is of pure white paper. A school of engraving was thus
                    founded by Raphael, through Marcantonio, which cast aside the minute details of
                    the early schools for a broad, harmonious treatment.</p>
                <p>We cannot here give a detailed account of the northern and southern schools of
                    line-engraving, which, after Durer and Marcantonio, developed themselves with
                    great rapidity and were ennobled by many famous names, but although we cannot
                    give lists of these, we may direct the student to a school of engraving which
                    marked a new development, the group known as the engravers of Rubens. That great
                    painter understood the importance of engraving as a means of increasing his fame
                    and wealth, and directed Vorsterman and others, as Raphael had directed
                    Marcantonio. The theory of engraving at that time was that it ought not to
                    render accurately the local colour of painting, which would appear wanting in
                    harmony when dissociated from the hues of the picture; and it was one of the
                    anxieties of Rubens so to direct his engravers that the result might be a fine
                    plate independently of what he had painted. To this end he helped his engravers
                    by drawings, in which he sometimes went so far as to indicate what he thought
                    the best direction for the lines. Rubens liked Vorsterman’s work, and scarcely
                    corrected it, a plate he especially approved being Susannah and the Elders,
                    which is a learned piece of work well modelled, and shaded everywhere on the
                    figures and costumes with fine curved lines, the straight line being reserved
                    for the masonry. Vorsterman quitted Rubens after executing fourteen important
                    plates, and was succeeded by Paul Pontius, then a youth of twenty, who went on
                    engraving from Rubens with increasing skill until the painter’s death. Boetius a
                    Bolswert engraved from Rubens towards the close of his life, and his brother
                    Schelte a Bolswert engraved more than sixty compositions from Rubens, of the
                    most varied character, including hunting scenes and landscapes. This brings us
                    to the engraving of landscape as a separate study. Rubens treated landscape in a
                    very broad comprehensive manner, and Schelte’s way of engraving it was also
                    broad and comprehensive. The lines are long and often undulating, the cross
                    hatchings bold and rather obtrusive, for they often substitute unpleasant
                    reticulations for the refinement and mystery of nature, but it was a beginning,
                    and a vigorous beginning. The technical developments of engraving under the
                    influence of Rubens may be summed up briefly as follows :—1. The Italian outline
                    had been discarded as the chief subject of attention, and modelling had been
                    substituted for it; 2. Broad masses had been substituted for the minutely
                    finished detail of the northern schools; 3. A system of light and dark bad been
                    adopted which was not pictorial, but belonged especially to engraving, w-hich it
                    rendered (in the opinion of Rubens) more harmonious.</p>
                <p>The history of line-engraving, from the time of Rubens to the beginning of the
                    19th century, is rather that of the vigorous and energetic application of
                    principles already accepted than any new development. From the two sources we
                    have already indicated, the school of Raphael and the school of Rubens, a double
                    tradition flowed to England and France, where it mingled and directed English
                    and French practice. The first influence on English line engraving was Flemish,
                    and came from Rubens through Vandyke, Vorsterman, and others; but the English
                    engravers soon underwent French and Italian influences, for although Payne
                    learned from a Fleming, Faithorne studied in France under the direction of
                    Philippe de Champagne the painter, and Robert Nanteuil the engraver. Sir Robert
                    Strange studied in France under Philippe Lebas, and then five years in Italy,
                    where he saturated his mind with Italian art. French engravers came to stay and
                    work in England as they went to study in Italy, so that the art of engraving
                    became in the 18th century a cosmopolitan language. In figure-engraving the
                    outline was less and less insisted upon. Strange made it his study to soften and
                    lose the outline. Meanwhile, the great classical Renaissance school, with Gérard
                    Audran at its head, had carried forward the art of modelling with the burin, and
                    had arrived at great perfection of a sober and dignified kind. Audran was very
                    productive in the latter half of the 17th century, and died in 1703, after a
                    life of severe self-direction in, labour, the best external influence he
                    underwent being that of the painter Nicolas Poussin. He made his work more rapid
                    by the use of etching, but kept it entirely subordinate to the work of the
                    burin. One of the finest of his large plates is St John Baptizing, from Poussin,
                    with groups of dignified figures in the foreground and a background of grand
                    classical landscape, all executed with the most thorough knowledge according to
                    the ideas of that time. The influence of Claude Lorrain on the engraving of
                    landscape was exercised less through his etchings than his pictures, which
                    compelled the engravers to study delicate distinctions in the values of light
                    and dark. In this way, through Woollet and Vivarès, Claude exercised an
                    influence on landscape engraving almost equal to that of Raphael and Rubens on
                    the engraving of the figure, though he did not, like those painters, direct his
                    engravers personally.</p>
                <p>In the 19th century line-engraving has received both an impulse and a check,
                    which by many is thought to be its death blow. The impulse came from the growth
                    of public wealth, the increasing interest in art and the increase in the
                    commerce of art, which now, by means of of engraving, penetrated into the homes
                    of the middle classes, as well as from the growing demand for illustrated books,
                    which have given employment to engravers of first-rate ability. The check to
                    line-engraving has come from the desire for cheaper and more rapid methods, a
                    desire satisfied in various ways, but especially by etching and by the various
                    kinds of photography. Nevertheless, the 19th century has produced most highly
                    accomplished work in line-engraving, both in the figure and in landscape. Its
                    characteristics, in comparison with the work ∣ of other centuries, are chiefly a
                    more thorough and delicate ' rendering of local colour, light and shade, and
                    texture. ' The elder engravers could draw as correctly as the, moderns, but they
                    either neglected these elements or admitted them sparingly, as opposed to the
                    spirit of their art. If you look at a modern engraving from Landseer, you will
                    see the blackness of a gentleman’s boots (local colour), the soft roughness of
                    his coat (texture), and the exact value in light and dark of his face and
                    costume against the cloudy sky. Nay more, you will find every sparkle on bit,
                    boot, and stirrup. Modern painting pays more attention to texture and
                    chiaroscuro than classical painting did, so engraving has followed in the same
                    directions. But there is a certain sameness in pure line-engraving which is more
                    favourable to some forms and textures than to others. This sameness of
                    line-engraving, and its costli-: ness, have led to the adoption of mixed
                    methods, which ’ are extremely prevalent in modern commercial prints from
                    popular artists. In the well-known prints from Rosa Bonheur, for example, by T.
                    Landseer, H. T. Ryall, and C. G. Lewis, the tone of the skies is got by
                    machine-ruling, and so is much undertone in the landscape; the fur of the
                    animals is all etched, and so are the foreground plants, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n462/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0462-0443"/> the real burin work being used sparingly where
                    most favourable to texture. Even in the exquisite engravings after Turner, by
                    Cooke, Goodall, Wallis, Miller, Willmore, and others, who reached a degree of
                    delicacy in light and shade far surpassing the work of the old masters, the
                    engravers have recourse to etching, finishing with the burin and dry point.
                    Turner’s name may be added to s those of Raphael, Rubens, and Claude in the list
                    of painters who have had a special influence upon engraving. The speciality of
                    Turner’s influence was in the direction of delicacy of tone. In this respect the
                    Turner vignettes to Roger’s poems were a high-water mark of human attainment,
                    not likely ever to be surpassed.</p>
                <p>Pure line-engraving is still practised by a few artists in England and France. In
                    England, Mr Jeens is a direct descendant of the great line engravers, and will
                    take high rank in the future by the perfection of his drawing and the good taste
                    with which he has used the burin in shading. In France, the lovers of
                    line-engraving have endeavoured to keep it alive by organizing themselves into a
                    society for its encouragement. The most recent direction of the art, in the
                    works of Ferdinand Gaillard, is a return to studied outline, but in combination
                    with the most elaborate modelling. In his St Sebastian the outline is studied
                    and marked with careful firmness throughout, and the modelling is thoroughly
                    worked out in minute touches and fine lines, giving powerful relief without any
                    but the most delicate chiaroscuro.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Etching.</hi></p>
                <p>We mentioned etching amongst the causes which have operated destructively on
                    line-engraving. The chief difference between the two arts is that in
                    line-engraving the furrow is produced by the ploughing of the burin, whereas in
                    etching the copper is eaten away by acid. The English word is merely an
                    Anglicized form of the Dutch <hi rend="italic">etsen,</hi> which has the same
                    origin as our verb to eat, consequently, unless there is corrosion, or eating
                    away of substance, there is no etching. The word is vulgarly and most
                    erroneously used for pen drawing.</p>
                <p>To prepare a plate for etching it is first covered with etching-ground, a
                    composition which resists acid. The qualities of a ground are to be so adhesive
                    that it will not quit the copper when a small quantity is left isolated between
                    lines, yet not so adhesive that the etching point cannot easily and cntirely
                    remove it; at the same time a good ground will be hard enough to bear the hand
                    upon it, or a sheet of paper, yet not so hard as to be brittle. The best is that
                    of Abraham Bosse, which is composed as follows :—Melt two ounces of white wax;
                    then add to it one ounce of gum-mastic in powder, a little at a time, stirring
                    till the wax and the mastic are well mingled; then add, in the same manner, an
                    ounce of bitumen in powder. There are three different ways of applying an
                    etchingground to a plate. The old-fashioned way was to wrap a ball of the ground
                    in silk, heat the plate, and then rub the; ball upon the surface, enough of the
                    ground to cover the plate melting through the silk. To equalize the ground a
                    dabber was used, which was made of cotton-wool under horsehair, the whole
                    inclosed in silk. This method is still used by many artists, from tradition and
                    habit, but it is far inferior in perfection and convenience to that which we
                    will now describe. When the etching-ground is melted, add to it half its volume
                    of essential oil of lavender, mix well, and allow the mixture to cool. You have
                    now a paste which can be spread upon a cold plate with a roller; these rollers
                    are covered with leather and made (very carefully) for the purpose. You first
                    spread a little paste on a sheet of glass (if too thick, add more oil of
                    lavender and mix with a palette knife), and roll it till the roller is quite
                    equally charged all over, when the paste is easily transferred to the copper,
                    which is afterwards gently heated to expel the oil of lavender. In both these
                    methods of grounding a plate the work is not completed until the ground has been
                    smoked, which is effected as follows. The plate is held by a hand-vice if a
                    small one, or, if large, is fixed at some height, with the covered side
                    downwards. A smoking torch, composed of many thin bees-wax dips twisted
                    together, is then lighted and passed repeatedly under the plate in every
                    direction, till the ground has incorporated enough lampblack to blacken it. The
                    third way of covering a plate for etching is to apply the ground in solution as
                    collodion is applied by photographers. The ground may be dissolved in
                    chloroform, or in oil of lavender. The plate being grounded, its back and edges
                    are protected from the acid by Japan varnish, which soon dries, and then the
                    drawing is traced upon it. The best way of tracing a drawing is to use sheet
                    gelatine, which is employed as follows. The gelatine-is laid upon the drawing,
                    which its transparence allows you to see perfectly, and you trace the lines by
                    scratching the smooth surface with a sharp point. You then fill these scratches
                    with fine black-lead, in powder, rubbing it in with the finger, turn the tracing
                    with its face to the plate, and rub the back of it with a burnisher. The
                    black-lead from the scratches adheres to the etching ground and shows upon it as
                    pale grey, much more visible than anything else you can use for tracing. Then
                    comes the work of the etchingneedle, which is merely a piece of steel sharpened
                    more or less. Turner used a prong of an old steel fork which did as well as
                    anything, but neater etching-needles are sold by artists’ colourmakers. The
                    needle removes the acid and lays the copper bare. Some artists sharpen their
                    needles so as to present a cutting edge which, when used sideways, scrapes away
                    a broad line; and many etchers use needles of various degrees of sharpness to
                    get thicker or thinner lines. It may be well to observe, in connection with this
                    part of the subject, that whilst thick lines agree perfectly well with the
                    nature of woodcut, they are very apt to give an unpleasant heaviness to plate
                    engraving of all kinds, whilst thin lines have generally a clear and agreeable
                    appearance in plate engraving. Nevertheless, lines of moderate thickness are
                    used effectively in etching when covered with finer shading, and very thick
                    lines indeed were employed with good results by Turner when he intended to cover
                    them with mezzotint, and to print in brown ink, because their thickness was
                    essential to prevent them from being overwhelmed by the mezzotint, and the brown
                    ink made them print less heavily than black. Etchers differ in opinion as to
                    whether the needle ought to scratch the copper or simply to glide upon its
                    surface. A gliding needle is much more free, and therefore communicates a
                    greater appearance of freedom to the etching, but it has the inconvenience that
                    the etching ground may not always be entirely removed, and then the lines may be
                    defective from insufficient biting. A scratching needle, on the other hand, is
                    free from this serious inconvenience, but it must not scratch irregularly so as
                    to <hi rend="italic">engrave</hi> lines of various depth. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >biting</hi> in former times was generally done with a mixture of nitrous acid
                    and water, in equal proportions; but in the present day a Dutch mordant is a
                    good deal used, which is composed as follows :—Hydrochloric acid, 100 grammes;
                    chlorate of potash, 20 grammes; water, 880 grammes. To make it, heat the water,
                    add the chlorate of potash, wait till it is entirely dissolved, and then add the
                    acid. The nitrous mordant acts rapidly, and causes ebullition; the Dutch mordant
                    acts slowly, and causes no ebullition. The nitrous mordant widens the lines; the
                    Dutch mordant bites in depth, and does not widen the lines to any perceptible
                    degree. The time required for both depends upon temperature. A mordant bites
                    slowly when cold, and mere <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0463-0444"/> and more rapidly when heated. To obviate
                    irregularity caused by difference of temperature, the writer of this paper has
                    found it a good plan to heat the Dutch mordant artificially to 95° Fahr, by
                    lamps under the bath (for which a photographer’s porcelain tray is most
                    convenient), and keep it steadily to that temperature; the results may then be
                    counted upon; but whatever the temperature fixed upon, the results will be
                    regular if it is regular. To get different degrees of biting on the same plate
                    the lines which are to be pale are “stopped out" by being painted over with
                    Japan varnish or with etching ground dissolved in oil of lavender, the darkest
                    lines being reserved to the last, as they have to bite longest. When the acid
                    has done its work properly the lines are bitten in such various degrees of depth
                    that they will print with the degree of blackness required; but if some parts of
                    the subject require to be made paler, they can be lowered by rubbing them with
                    charcoal and olive oil, and if they have to be made deeper they can befebitten,
                    . or covered with added shading. Rebiting is done with the roller above
                    mentioned, which is now charged very lightly with paste and rolled over the
                    copper with no pressure but its own weight, so as to cover the smooth surface,
                    but not fill up any of the lines. The oil of lavender is then expelled as before
                    by gently heating the plate, but it is not smoked. The lines which require
                    rebiting may now be rebitten, and the others preserved against the action of the
                    acid by stopping out. These are a few of the most essential technical points in
                    etching, but there are many matters of detail for which the reader is referred
                    to the special works on the subject.</p>
                <p>The two countries in which etching has been most practised are Holland and
                    France. It has also been successfully practised in Italy, Germany, and England,
                    but not to so great an extent. It has resembled line engraving in receiving a
                    powerful impulse from celebrated painters, but whereas with the exception of
                    Albert Durer the painters have seldom been practical line engravers, they have
                    advanced etching not only by advice given to others but by i the work of their
                    own hands. Rembrandt didas much for etching as either Raphael or Rubens for line
                    engraving; and in landscape the etchings of Claude had an influence which still
                    continues, both Rembrandt and Claude being practical workmen in etching, and
                    very skilful workmen. And not only these, but many other eminent painters have
                    practised etching successfully, each in his own way. Ostade, Ruysdael, Berghem,
                    Paul Potter, Karl Dujardin, etched as they painted, and so did a greater than
                    any of them, Vandyke. In the earlier part of the present century etching was
                    almost a defunct art, except as it was employed by engravers as a help to get
                    faster through their work, of which “engraving” got all the credit, the public
                    being unable to distinguish between etched lines and lines cut with the burin.
                    During the last fifteen or twenty years, however, there has been a great revival
                    of etching as an independent art, a revival which has extended all over Europe,
                    though France has had by far the largest and most important share in it. It was
                    hoped, at the beginning of this revival, that it would lead to the production of
                    many fine original works; but the commercial laws of demand and supply have
                    unfortunately made modern etching almost entirely the slave of painting. Nearly
                    all the clever etchers of the present day are occupied in translating pictures,
                    which many of them, especially Unger, Jacquemart, Flameng, and Rajon, do with
                    remarkable ability, even to the very touch and texture of the painter. The
                    comparative rapidity of the process, and the ease with which it imitates the
                    manner of painters, have caused etching to be now very generally preferred to
                    line engraving by publishers for the translation of all pictures except those
                    belonging to a severe and classical style of art, for which the burin is, and
                    will always remain, better adapted than the etching-needle.</p>
                <p>Yet, notwithstanding the present commercial predomi nance of etching from
                    pictures, there are still some artists and eminent amateurs who have cultivated
                    original etching with success. Mr Seymour Haden, Mr Whistler, Mr Samuel Palmer,
                    and others in England, MM. Bracquemond, Daubigny, Charles Jacque, Appian,
                    Lalanne, and others on the Continent, besides that singular and remarkable
                    genius Charles Méryon, have produced original works of very various interest and
                    power. Etching clubs, or associations of artists for the publication of original
                    etchings, have been founded in England, France, Germany, and Belgium. The real
                    difficulty of the art, and its apparent facility, have led to much worthless
                    production, but this ought not to make us overlook what is really valuable.</p>
                <p>The following is a brief analysis of different styles of etching. 1. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pure Line—</hi>.As there is line engraving, so there is line
                    etching: but as the etching·needle is a freer instrument than the burin, the
                    line has qualities which differ widely from those of the burin line. Each of the
                    two has its own charm and beauty; the liberty of the one is charming, and the
                    restraint of the other is admirable also in its right place. In line etching, as
                    in line engraving, the great masters purposely exhibit the line and do not hide
                    it under too much shading. 2. <hi rend="italic">Line and Shade.</hi> —-This
                    answers exactly in etching to Mantegna’s work in engraving. The most important
                    lines are drawn first throughout, and the shade thrown over them like a wash
                    with the brush over a pen sketch in indelible ink. 3. <hi rend="italic">Shade
                    and Texture.—</hi> This is used chiefly to imitate oil-painting. Here the line
                    (properly so called) is entirely abandoned, and the attention of the etcher is
                    given to texture and chiaroscuro. He uses lines, of course, to express these,
                    but does not exhibit them for their own beauty; on the contrary, he conceals
                    them.</p>
                <p>Of these three styles of etching the first is technically the easiest, and being
                    also the most rapid, is adopted for sketching on the copper from nature; the
                    second is the next in difficulty; and the third the most difficult, on account
                    of the biting, which is never easy to manage when it becomes elaborate. The
                    etcher has, however, many resources; he can make passages paler by burnishing
                    them, or by using charcoal, or he can efface them entirely with the scraper and
                    charcoal; he can darken them by rebiting or by regrounding the plate and adding
                    fresh work; and he need not run the risk of biting the very palest passages of
                    all, because these can be easily done with the dry point, which is simply a
                    well-sharpened stylus used directly on the copper without the help of acid. It
                    is often asserted that anyone can etch who can draw, but this is a mistaken
                    assertion likely to mislead. Without requiring so long an apprenticeship as the
                    burin, etching is a very difficult art indeed, the two main causes of its
                    difficulty being that the artist does not see his work properly as he proceeds,
                    and that mistakes or misfortunes in the biting, which are of frequent occurrence
                    to the inexperienced, may destroy all the relations of tone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aquatint.—</hi> This is a kind of etching which successfully
                    imitates washes with a brush. There are many ways of preparing a plate for
                    aquatint, but the following is the best. Have three different solutions of rosin
                    in rectified alcohol, making them of various degrees of strength, but always
                    thin enough to be quite fluid, the weakest*solution being almost colourless.
                    First pour the strongest solution on the plate. When it dries it will produce a
                    granulation; and you may now bite as in ordinary etching for your darker tones,
                    stopping out what the acid is not to operate upon, or you may use a brush
                    charged with acid, perchloride of iron being a very good mordant for the
                    purpose. After cleaning the plate, you proceed with the weaker solutions in the
                    same way, the weakest giving the finest granulation for skies, distances,
                    &lt;fcc. The process <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n464/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0464-0445"/> requires a good deal of stopping-out, and some
                    burnishing, scraping, &lt;fcc., at last It has been employed very successfully
                    by M. Brunet Debaines in his plates from Turner, especially in Agrippina landing
                    with the Ashes of Germanicus. Aquatint may be effectively used in combination
                    with line etching, and still more harmoniously with soft ground etching in which
                    the line imitates that of the lead pencil.</p>
                <p>The natural tendency of the three kinds of engraving we have studied is from line
                    to shade and from shade to texture. The perfection of line is seldom maintained
                    when the attention of artists has been directed to the other elements, for line
                    is a separate study. Shade is its enemy, butline may still survive under a veil
                    of half shade. When chiaroscuro becomes complete the delicacy cf line, which is
                    an abstraction, is nearly lost; and when texture becomes an object also, the
                    line is lost altogether. This appears to be the natural law of development in
                    the graphic arts, and it is an approach to nature, which is all shade and
                    texture without line; yet the pure·line is a loss in art, from its ready
                    expression of the feeling of the artist, and a loss for which more natural truth
                    is not always a compensation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mezzotint.</hi></p>
                <p>Of all the kinds of engraving, mezzotint comes nearest to nature, though it is
                    far from being the best as a means of artistic expression. It is said to have
                    been invented by Prince Rupert, or by Lewis Siegen, a lieutenant in his service,
                    in or about the year 1611, and to have been suggested by the rust on a weapon
                    which a soldier was cleaning. The plate is prepared (before any design is made
                    upon it) by means of an instrument like a chisel, with the edge ground into the
                    segment of a circle like the rocker of a cradle, and so engraved as to present
                    when sharp about 100 or 120 small teeth. This cradle is rocked from side to side
                    with the hand, and every tooth makes a small dent in the copper, and raises a
                    corresponding bur. The whole surface of the plate is gone over with this
                    instrument about eighty times, in different directions, before it is in a fit
                    condition to be worked upon. When sufficiently prepared it presents ∙a fine
                    soft-looking and perfectly even grain, and if in this state a proof is taken
                    from it by the usual process of copper-plate printing, the result is nothing but
                    the richest possible black. The engraver works from dark to light by removing
                    the grain with a scraper, and exactly in proportion as he removes it the tint
                    becomes paler and paler. Pure whites are got by scraping the grain away
                    entirely, and burnishing the place. As the process is from dark to light, the
                    engraver has to be very cautious not to remove too much of his grain at once. He
                    proceeds gradually from dark to half-dark, from half-dark to middletint, from
                    middle-tint to half-light, and from half-light to light. He has nothing to do
                    with line, but thinks entirely of masses relieved from each other by
                    chiaroscuro. When the work is good the result is soft and harmonious, well
                    adapted to the interpretation of some painters, but not of all. As the art has
                    been most practised in England, some of its most successful work has been
                    employed in the translation of English artists. More than a hundred engravers in
                    mezzotint employed themselves on the portraits of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the
                    best of their works are now valued as the classics of the art, which is
                    connected with the name of Reynolds just as line engraving is connected with
                    that of Raphael. Turner and Constable’s landscapes were also admirably engraved
                    in mezzotint by Lupton and others, Turner himself being a good mezzotint
                    engraver, though he practised the art little. Mezzotint, engraving is still
                    practised in England with great skill by Cousens and others, and would no doubt
                    be more resorted to than it is if the plates yielded larger editions, but
                    unfortunately they soon show signs of wear.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dry point</hi> is really nothing but mezzotint in line. As the
                    point of the stylus makes its scratch on the copper, it raises a bur, which
                    retains the ink in the printing just as the bur from the cradle does in
                    mezzotint. The bur of dry point also wears away fast, and yields but few
                    impressions.</p>
                <p>Copper, steel, and zinc are the metals chiefly used for engraving. Steel is less
                    employed than formerly, because copper is now covered with a coat of steel by
                    the electrotype process, which enables it to resist printing indefinitely, as
                    the steel can be renewed at will. Zinc is similarly coated with copper, and
                    sometimes used for small editions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Authorities.</hi> —A real knowledge of engraving can only be
                    attained by a careful study and comparison of the prints themselves, oτ cf
                    accurate facsimiles, so that books are of little use except as guides to prints
                    when the reader happens to be unaware of their existence, or else for their
                    explanation of technical processes. The department of art-literature which
                    classifies prints is called <hi rend="italic">Iconography,</hi> and the
                    classifications adopted by monographers are of the most various kinds. For
                    example, if a complete book were written on Shakespearian iconography it would
                    contain full information about all prints illustrating the life and works of
                    Shakespeare, and in the same way there may be the iconography of a locality or
                    of a single event. The history of engraving is a part of iconography, and there
                    are already various histories of the art in different languages. In England Mr
                    W. Y. Ottley wrote an <hi rend="italic">Early History of Engraving,</hi>
                    published in two volumes 4to, 1816, and began what was intended to be a series
                    of notices on engravers and their works. Mr H. Ottley has also written upon the
                    same subject. The facilities for the reproduction of engravings by the
                    photographic processes have of late years given an impetus to iconography. One
                    of the most reliable modern writers on the subject is Μ. Georges Duplessis, the
                    keeper of prints in the national library of France. He has written the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Engraving in France,</hi> and has published many
                    notices of engravers to accompany the reproductions by Μ. Amand Durand. He is
                    also the author of a useful little manual entitled <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Merveilles</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Gravure.</hi> Count de Laborde collected
                    materials for a history of wood-engraving, and began to publish them, but the
                    work advanced no farther than a first number. Jansen’s work on the origin of
                    wood and plate engraving, and on the knowledge of prints of the 15th and 16th
                    centuries, was published at Paris in two volumes 8vo in 1808. Didot’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai typographique et bibliographique sur Vhistoire de la gravure
                    sur bois</hi> was published in Paris (8vo)in 1863. A <hi rend="italic">Treatise
                    on l·Vood Engraving,</hi> by John Jackson, appeared in 1839, and a second
                    edition of the work in 1861. A good deal of valuable scattered information about
                    engraving is to be found in the back numbers of the principal art periodicals,
                    such as the <hi rend="italic">Gazette des Beaux-Arts, L'Art,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Portfolio.</hi> In the year 1877 Professor Colvin published a
                    series of articles in the <hi rend="italic">Portfolio</hi> on “Albert Durer, His
                    Teachers, His Rivals, and His Followers,” which contain in a concentrated form
                    the main results of what is known about the early engravers, with facsimiles
                    from t·heir works. Professor Ruskin has also published a volume on engraving,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Ariadne Fiorentina,</hi> in which the reader will
                    find much that is suggestive; but he ought to be on his guard against certain
                    assertions of the author, especially these two, —(1) that all good engraving
                    rejects chiaroscuro, and (2) that, etching is an indolent and blundering process
                    at the best. The illustrations to this volume are of unequal merit: the
                    facsimiles from Holbein are good; the reductions of early Italian engravings are
                    not good. The reader will find information about engraving, and many facsimiles
                    of old woodcuts, in the different volumes by Paul Lacroix on the Middle Ages and
                    the Renaissance, published by Firmin Didot; the information may be relied upon,
                    but the facsimiles, though effective, are not always perfect. Roret’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection de Manuels formant</hi><hi rend="italic">une
                    Encyclopédie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arts</hi> contains a pocket volume on engraving which is full
                    of useful practical information, and another similar volume on plate-printing,
                    also very useful to engravers on metal, who ought always to understand printing;
                    thes&lt; volumes may be had separately. Etching has been the subject ot several
                    different treatises. The oldest is that of Abraham Bosse, published at Paris in
                    1645, 8vo, and in 1701, 12rno. The revival of etching in our own day has been
                    accompanied by the publication of various treatises. The first was a short
                    account of the old process by Air Alfred Ashley; then came the French <hi
                    rend="italic">brochure</hi> of Μ. Maxime Lalanne; then <hi rend="italic">Etching
                    and Etchers</hi> (450 pages, in the stereotyped edition) by the writer of this
                    article, and a smaller treatise, <hi rend="italic">The Etcher's Handbook,</hi>
                    by the same. These were followed· by another short French handbook, that of Μ.
                    Martial. For information about the states of plates, their prices, their
                    authenticity and history, the student ought to consult the best
                    catalogue-makers, such as Bartsch, Claussin, Charles Blanc, &amp;c. The
                    literature of engraving <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n465/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0465-0446"/> is now rapidly increasing in consequence of the
                    new processes of reproduction, and the great engravers of past times are
                    becoming much better known. Works on the subject frequently appear, not only in
                    England and France, but also in Germany, whilst Holland and Italy bring their
                    contributions to general iconography. In consequence of this rapid extension of
                    studies on the subject, any attempt at a universal bibliography of works about
                    engraving would soon become obsolete or incomplete. (P. G. H.)</p>
