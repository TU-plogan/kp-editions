                    theological term for the facts revealed in Scripture about a future state, and

                <p>The origin of the term is to be found in the phrases “the last day,” “the last
                    times,” and similar expressions adopted by New Testament writers from ancient

                    Christians that they were living in the last period of the world’s history.
                    Their conflict with surrounding paganism constituted the final struggle between

                    visible triumph. The feeling was natural, and not new. The Jews always believed
                    that the Messianic kingdom would be preceded by an unusual manifestation of the
                    hostile powers of heathenism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    times of great national distress the excess of misery was regarded as a sign of
                    approaching deliverance; and the hopes of the nation were revived and its
                    courage sustained by apocalyptic visions, in which the future was depicted as a
                    time of undisputed triumph and unending prosperity. A distinct class of
                    literature—of which the prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah afford partial
                    examples—grew out of this feeling, and from it has been mainly derived the form,
                    not only of Jewish, but also of Christian eschatology.</p>

                    that formed the dividing-point between these two periods remained associated all
                    that ancient prophecy connected with the restoration of the Hebrew monarchy. The
                    apocalyptic literature which began with the book of Daniel, and which belongs to
                    the post-exile period, had, it is true, already changed the form of the
                    primitive national hopes. The restoration had become the resurrection; the idea
                    of judgment had been enlarged to include the dead; and the final consummation
                    was depicted, not as a mere distinction of the heathen or their subjugation to
                    Judaism, butas a universal catastrophe in which all who had ever lived would
                    have their part. But the mode of presentation had not changed, and the old
                    prophetic language was literally adopted, although the sphere of its application
                    had so infinitely extended.</p>
                <p>Christian eschatology, then, is especially occupied with the destinies of the
                    church in the concluding act of the world’s drama. In formal treatises which
                    trace the historical development of the opinion on the last things, they are
                    usually arranged under the heads—Second Advent, Millennium, Resurrection,
                    Judgment, Conflagration of the World, and the State of the Blessed and the
                    Damned.</p>
                <p>But experience taught the first generation of Christians to postpone the moment
                    of the realization of their hopes. The second advent—which,however, as the
                    fourth gospel teaches, had already been spiritually realized—was delayed.
                    Already when St Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, some had died before the
                    fulfilment of their desire, and the church was troubled with fears lest they
                    should awake from the deathsleep too late for the divine appearing. A new epoch
                    was therefore introduced. The destinies of the individual from the moment of
                    departure from this life enter into the inquiry, and the already boundless field
                    of speculation is increased by the addition of controversies about an
                    intermediate state, purgatory, and the limboes<note anchored="true"

                    the schoolmen partitioned hell. Nor is the area of theory substantially narrowed
                    for Protestant theology, although it limits the last things to four—death,
                    resurrection, judgment, end of the world, or more commonly, in practical dis
                    courses, to death, judgment, heaven, and hell.</p>
                <p>The history of eschatology is in great measure the history of “lawless and
                    uncertain thoughts” on these matters. The best notion of the extravagances
                    allowed to speculation is obtained by a glance at the concluding part of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologice,</hi> where Aquina3
                    discusses these subjects. Thirty questions (besides an appendix devoted to
                    purgatory) are proposed, each question being divided into several articles, and
                    each article supported and opposed by many arguments. Then follows a conclusion,
                    with the doctor’s remarks on his conclusion. We take a few of the propositions
                    at random :—“Whether souls are conducted to heaven or to hell immediately after
                    death ;” “Whether the limbus of hell is the same as Abraham’s bosom ;” “Whether
                    the limbus puerorum is the same as the limbus patrum;” or, passing over a few
                    pages, “Whether the sun and moon will be really obscured at the day of
                    judgment;” “Whether the fire which is to purge the world will be like in kind to
                    elemental fire ;” or again, “Whether all the members of the human body will rise
                    with it ;” “Whether the hair and nails will reappear;” and so on to questions of
                    age, size, and sex.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    been called “a whirlpool of interminable controversy, roaring in endless circles
                    over a dark and bottomless abyss.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    heaven and hell, while poetry and art were permitted to seize on the unseen

                <p>There are two distinct modes of treatment for these difficult subjects. In the

                    with every revival of the Platonic philosophy, which, as Neander observes,
                    extended its spiritualizing influence to eschatology as to other doctrines of
                    the faith.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first
                            clear note of immortality in Hebrew literature is struck in the Book of
                            Wisdom, the work of an Alexandrian Jew. The Origenists, perhaps Scofus
                            Erigena, and, in later times, some at least of the Cambridge Platonists,
                            are examples of the statement above.</p></note></p>
                <p>But without entering on the region of pure speculation, the New Testament itself
                    discloses two entirely different eschatological methods. The one is moral,
                    spiritual, idealist, employing outward forms only as symbols, viewing the future
                    rather in regard to development of character than as a mode of existence. This
                    is the Christian as contrasted with the J ewish method. The other follows the
                    natural tendency of Hebrew thought. It is literal, material, sensuous. It
                    delights in chronological arrangements of the unknown future, and topographical
                    arrangements of the unseen world. Missing the repeated warnings of Christ,
                    delivered both in parables and in express admonitions— warnings to prepare for a
                    slow and gradual development of His kingdom, and to leave “the times” in His
                    Father’s keeping—this method aims in all its representations at abrupt
                    catastrophe and at a consummation depending on startling and supernatural
                        surprises.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Abrupt

                            i. 249.</p></note></p>
                <p>These distinctive tendencies appear within the New Testament most prominently—the
                    one in the fourth gospel the other in the Apocalypse. The Pauline theology
                    exhibits them side by side, showing their discordance in the absence of all
                    attempt on the part of the apostle to reconcile them. Thus in his treatment of
                    the resurrection, in the one view it is the sudden appearing of Christ which
                    will begin the heavenly life for all, in the other this life in Christ—begun
                    already on earth—will attain its perfection at the death of the individual. As
                    the moment of the second advent receded, the church’s expectation necessarily
                    transferred the object of Christian hope—the communion with Christ in the
                    kingdom of glory—to the earlier event, death; but St Paul retains the old
                    terminology without endeavouring to adapt it to this change <hi rend="italic"
                        >{cf.</hi> Phil. i. 22, 23, iii. 10, 11, with 1 Cor. xv. 52 <hi
                        rend="italic">f.;</hi> 1 Thess. iv. 15, drc.). The same discordance is
                    observable in his treatment of the judgment and of the end of the world. In his
                    use of terms and reference to times the apostle follows his Jewish training.
                    “The day of the Lord,” with all its prophetic associations as “day of judgment,”
                    is preserved; the sudden and final award of wrath or favour appears in its
                    forensic form; and all is ended by a separation between the heirs of eternal
                    life and the lost.</p>
                <p>But the spirit of the apostolic teaching is independent of this form. The idea
                    that regards the development of the higher life as a constant process varying in
                    each individual, but having its roots in the common life of the church,—that
                    looks on to the ultimate perfection as a unity of all with the Redeemer in God,
                    the whole universe having been gradually subdued by Christ to himself,—this,
                    which we may call the essentially Christian idea, is what we receive as the
                    innermost feeling of the man who, from a Pharisee and a zealous upholder of the
                    law, was called to be a chosen instrument of the gospel of the favour of God in
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>In the patristic period the conflict between the two rival systems is apparent in
                    every detail. Here, as everywhere else, the opposition is marked in regard to
                    the duration of punishment. But it rages most fiercely, perhaps, round the
                    doctrine of the millennium. The earthly reign of Messiah was transferred from
                    Jewish to Christian expectation. But the Christian hope could not without
                    inconsistency take a Jewish form. Christ’s kingdom of heaven refused to realize
                    itself as a period of sensual enjoyment, and the poetic chronology of the
                    apocalypse was soon found to have raised difficulties of an insurmountable kind
                    which were not diminished when a locality was sought for the promised earthly
                    reign. If it was found at Jerusalem before the final judgment, how could the
                    expectations connected with the second advent be fulfilled? In the Apocalypse
                    the completion of the kingdom of God takes place in the New Jerusalem—the
                    millennium appearing only as an interval of rest after the crisis of the
                    conflict with Antichrist. Thus a new decisive epoch is introduced, the
                    consummation of things having thus gradually receded from the incarnation, which
                    was the focus of Jewish eschatology, to the second advent, and still further to
                    the close of the millennial reign. The later interpretation, fixing the
                    beginning of the thousand years kingdom at the incarnation, though decidedly
                    opposed to the Apocalypse, is a recurrence to the primitive Jewish view. In
                    accordance with this opinion, the end of the world was very generally expected
                    about the year 1000. Another view dated the millennium from the formal adoption
                    of Christianity by the empire under Constantine, and caused the expectation of
                    the end of things which was so prevalent in the 14th century.<note

                <p>The most important of all the questions that arise in connection with eschatology
                    relates, of course, to the teaching of our Lord. A true view of the future must
                    be a Theodicea. It must correspond to the highest human conception of the nature
                    and character of God. The revelation in and through Christ affords this highest
                    conception. And yet it is in the discourses of Christ himself that men find the
                    passages which seem toprove the doctrine most irreconcilable with the insight He
                    has elsewhere given into the Divine heart.</p>
                <p>Now, Christ was not the first to “stamp ideas of immortality on the minds of men

                <p>Eternity of punishment is often assumed to be a truth of natural religion,—an
                    intuitive human belief. It would be truer to say that in all races the first
                    vague guesses at immortality include no thought of retribution at all. The
                    continued existence was “something between being and not being.”<note

                    only as a shadow of himself. Intellectually and morally he ended at death. Homer
                    speaks of life and form in Hades, but says there is no mind there at all. The
                    movement, freedom, joy of existence, ended for the Greek at death. The best that
                    could then happen to him was to kuow that his body had been buried. All else was
                    featureless, lifeless, inane,—an existence without even the excitement of the
                    possibility of dying again. The bourne once reached, not only was there no
                    return, but no further bourne remained to be aimed at. Thus the intense
                    consciousness of the apparent finality of death determined the form of the
                    earliest hopes of immortality when they began to dawn. Progress did not enter
                    into them; there would be no discipline because nothing to exercise it on, no
                    change of condition, for this implies power of adaptation if not of choice.</p>

                    as originally conceived, a vast subterranean tomb, with the barred and bolted
                    gates common to Hebrew tombs, in which the ghosts (Rephaim) did not even flit
                    about, but lay like corpses in a sepulchre. No thought of retribution was
                    connected with this deep and gloomy under-world. It was the common receptacle of
                    all. The distinctions there were social or national, not moral. The only
                    approach to a retributive idea is found in the exile time, in an expression of
                    Ezekiel’s, who locates the uncircumcised heathen in the “sides of the pit,”
                    possibly the deepest and darkest part of Sheol. (See Ps. lxiii. 9, lxxxix. 19,
                    cxliii. 3, cvii. 18; Job X. 20-22, xi. 8, iii. 14, xxx. 23; Is. vii. 11, xviιi.

                <p>This primitive idea had, by the time of Christ, developed under influences of a
                    very different kind. In the first place, the horror with which an ancient Hebrew
                    had contemplated death, because in Sheol he would be cut off from all communion
                    with the covenant God, was dissipated under the truer religious feeling
                    struggling into life in the later Psalms and the book of Job.<note

                    first it had been believed that Jehovah’s control did not reach to the
                    under-world. The King of Terrors was its only king. They who had been God’s
                    sheep when alive, in Sheol had a new shepherd, Death (Ps. xlix. 14, Perowne’s
                    translation). But truer views of God’s nature dissipated this horror, and pious
                    souls who despaired of redress in this life, began to look even in Sheol for a
                    manifestation of divine justice and a proof of divine love. At length was
                    grasped the hope of a deliverance from the prison house of the dead, and the
                    doctrine of the resurrection crowned this hope, and gave a definite shape to the
                    eschatology of the Jews.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The release from the under-world which the Jew contemplated in a bodily

                    Josephus <hi rend="italic">(fJeU. Jud.,</hi> ii. 8, 14), this was also a
                    doctrine of the Pharisees and the</p>

                            influence on the views of Origen is well known.</p></note> So the
                    Hebrews believed that the heathen and unjust would remain in the death-sleep of
                    Sheol, while faithful Israel received back the soul in the resurrection (2 Macc.
                    vii. 14, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xviii. 1,
                    3). In different forms this thought reappears in Christian eschatology. Some
                    find it in St Γaul. It was the origin of the belief in a two-fold resurrection:
                    the unjust, not being worthy to participate when the saints awake at their
                    Lord’s second coming, remain below till the final judgment.</p>
                <p>But iu the post-exile days—that veritable middle age of Israel—other influences
                    appeared. Intolerable wrongs drove men to seek solace for themselves in visions
                    of paradise, vengeance on their foes in visions of hell. Now appear the
                    divisions of Sheol into receptacles for the good and bad. Their origin is seen
                    in the apocalyptic book of Enoch. In chap, xxii. of that remarkable book, which,

                    torment of surpassing horror, no foreign influence was necessary. Gehenna (f.e.,
                    the valley of Hinnom or the sons of Hinnom) and its ghastly associations were
                    ready to supply images terrible beyond any that the mind of heathen poet or
                    philosopher had conceived. Already known as the perpetual abode of corruption
                    and fire, “the place where lie the corpses of those who have transgressed
                    against Jehovah—and their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be
                    quenched,” it had become the apt symbol of utter moral depravity and ruin. But
                    it was the unknown author of the book of Enoch who first saw it as “the accursed
                    of the accursed for ever,” who first placed in the dark ravine one of the mouths
                    of hell, and thus from an emblem of the moral ruin attending sin, made it the
                    actual place of punishment for sinners.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    its fanciful recesses. Enough has been said to show that when our Lord came he
                    found the doctrines of last things presented in forms already fixed, and the
                    terms Gehenna, Paradise, &amp;c., in familiar and even proverbial use (Matt,
                    xxiii. 15, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> James iii. 6).</p>
                <p>The popular views of a future state regard the use Jesus made of current terms as
                    a sanction of their literal meaning. But from the very earliest Christian times
                    another interpretation has been given. It has been understood that Christ
                    treated popular religious terms as only the symbols of a false creed can be
                    effectually treated. He rescued them for the service of the new and true. “He
                    took from their future and remote, in order to give them a present and
                    immediate, force and aspect.” He employed the familiar images of heaven and hell
                    to impress on men’s consciences the supreme bliss of righteousness and the awful
                    misery of sin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This view
                            is very generally adopted with regard to the “worm” of Gehenna, which is
                            interpreted to mean the gnawing of an evil conscience. Unfortunately the
                            fashion set by Augustine of choosing what terms shall be literal and
                            what metaphorical has prevailed. See Aug., <hi rend="italic">Civ.

                            body.</p></note> If His words have been misapprehended and
                    misrepresented in this particular, so were they, even by the first disciples, in
                    others (John xi. 13; Mark viii. 16, &amp;?.). He taught on the principle of His
                    well-known saying, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”<note

                <p>Special instances would take us to too great a length. Christ’s treatment of the
                    resurrection, both with sceptics and believers (Matt, xxiι. 30-32; John xi. 25),
                    was such as to dislodge His hearers’ thoughts from the accidents (so to speak)
                    of the great change, and fix them on its moral and spiritual aspects. The same
                    intention appears also in His allusion to the judgment (John v. 25); while in
                    the one unmistakable reference to the future heaven, He fastens the hope of His
                    followers entirely on the thought of abiding communion with Himself (John xiv.
                    1-3).</p>
                <p>There are still certain features of eschatological doctrine which require notice.
                    The notion of an Intermediate State was generally prevalent during the first
                    three centuries. It was exactly analogous to the Jewish notion of a divided
                    under world. The souls of the pious, says Justin <hi rend="italic">{D. e.
                        Tryph.,</hi> 5), take up their abode in a better, those of the wicked in a
                    worse place. Tertulliau, however, believed that the martyrs went direct to the
                    bliss of heaven—a view probably founded on Rev. vii. 14, 15. The doctrine
                    changed its shape many times. It produced an Arabian heresy combated by Origen,
                    that both soul and body fall into a death sleep, fιom which they will not awake
                    to the last day. Revived at a later time, under the name Psychopannychy, it was
                    made the subject of a treatise by Calvin. But the existence of an intermediate
                    state remains a dogma of the Eastern Church to this day. In the Western the
                    doctrine of Purgatory gradually absorbed it.</p>
                <p>The idea of a purifying fire seems to have grown originally out of the belief in
                    the general conflagration of the world. This belief, which so much occupies the
                    Sibylline books, came perhaps from the Stoic philosophy.<note anchored="true"

                    by Deut, xxxii. 22, and though it finds no place in the Apocalypse, had
                    penetrated religious thought before the composition of the second epistle of
                    Peter (2 Pet. iii. 7-12). The early fathers agree in ascribing to this fire a
                    purgative virtue, but with every variety of opinion as to the mode o.' its
                    operation. Augustine first transferred it to Hades and the intermediate state,
                    thus laying the foundation for the view of purgatory which Gregory the Great
                    formulated into a dogma. Distinction must always be made between the early
                    purifying flames, through which good and bad alike were destined to pass, and
                    the Roman purgatory, in which only those destined at last for heaven worked out
                    the residue of the temporal penalty for sin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Reformed eschatology differs from that of the primitive church in the absence of
                    the intermediate state, from that of Rome in the rejection of purgatory. Both
                    these forms of belief are felt to have mitigated in some degree the doctrine of
                    an endless hell, which in Protestantism is brought more prominently into the
                    foreground, the final doom being fixed not now at the general judgment, but at
                    death, at which, without any authority from Scripture, the popular creed
                    supposes the sinner’s fate to be unalterably determined.</p>

                    famous essay. His own struggle to regain for the adjective αιώνιος its ethical
                    sense is well known. Perhaps he took too little account of the element of
                    duration undoubtedly existing in it. The two senses pass imperceptibly into one
                    another, but the scriptural use, when not distinctly ethical, gives it the sense
                    of indefinite not of endless duration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Maurice vindicated, at least for English clergymen, a perfect freedom on this

                    confirmed by the formal decision in the “Essays and Reviews” case.</p>
                <p>The result of this is apparent now throughout the thinking part of Christendom;
                    the subject of eschatology, in connexion with the wider subject of immortality,
                    is exercising profound attention. Philosophy and science are equally concerned
                    in it with religion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>Two prominent attempts perhaps claim notice. The ad vocates of Conditional
                    Immortality or Annihilation maintain, from the letter of Scripture, destruction
                    and not endless suffering to be the destiny of the lost. They take advan tage of
                    the doubt existing as to St Paul’s doctrine of the termination of the world in
                    unity—whether by unbelievers being completely annihilated, or by their being all
                    finally converted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                        punishment.”</p></note> The view that immortality is not inherent in fallen
                    human nature, but is the gift of God in Christ, has had many supporters, and in
                    this part of their system, the advocates of annihilation justly claim the
                    authority of many great names. But the details of their eschatology are somewhat
                    confused and conflicting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            passages which seem clearly to imply either the ultimate redemption or

                <p>The Universaliste or Origenists maintain, in the language of Acts iii. 21, a hope
                    of the “restitution of all things.” The hope is grounded not on the literal
                    assertion of any one text,—though as many are quotedin its favour as in that of
                    any other theory of the future,—but on the divine character and purpose as
                    revealed in Christ, and the implied failure of the redemptive work of the
                    Saviour unless all for whom He died ultimately partake of salvation. Between
                    this and the Augustinian system, which the great doctor candidly confesses dooms
                    the vast majority of men to endless perdition, there are of course many
                    gradations of opinion. Possibly Universaliste are apt to quote in their favour
                    all who in any degree show themselves, to use Augustine’s word, more merciful.
                    Certainly a long list of illustrious names claim rank among them. Origen, of
                    course, heads it, though earlier fathers—Athenagoras, for instance—are sometimes
                    called in as witnesses of the milder creed. The fate of those who had died
                    before Christ, and of the heathen, began at an early time to exercise the
                    conscience of Christians. The descent of Christ into hell was by many believed
                    to have had for its object the deliverance of souls from thence.<note
