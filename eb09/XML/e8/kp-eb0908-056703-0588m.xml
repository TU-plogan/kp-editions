                    should fall upon the English such as they had never yet suffered. Such evils did
                    fall upon them, and were doubtless chiefly due to the king. He possessed
                    considerable energy when roused to exert himself, but it was only exercised
                    fitfully, and generally misdirected, being always awanting at critical periods,
                    and never used but to the disadvantage of his kingdom. Careless of everything
                    but his immediate comfort or the gratification of an immediate whim, and
                    listless and fond of ease, he allowed his kingdom and himself to be managed by
                    worthless favourites, whose acts of, as it seems to us, open treachery were not
                    only allowed to pass unpunished, in a manner which appears to us unaccountable,
                    but seemed almost to form steps in their ladder of advancement to special
                    influence and favour with the king. The successes attending the Danish invasions
                    in the reign of Ethelred were due almost wholly to three causes,—the
                    unpreparedness of the Anglo-Saxons, the treachery of the earls, and the failure
                    of the king to follow up victories which were often won with no special
                    preparation, and without adequate leaders. About two years after Ethelred
                    mounted the throne the Danish invasions recommenced, but it was not till a later
                    period that their inroads assumed the serious aspect of an attempt to conquer
                    the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. In 988 they were defeated at Watchet in Somersetshire,
                    and in 991 at Maldon, immediately after which latter victory, Ethelred purchased
                    peace from his defeated enemies by money raised through means of the oppressive
                    tax known as the “Danegeld.” The Danes were allowed to stay in England, and they
                    on their part agreed to help Ethelred against any other foreign fleet that might
                    attack him; but for some reason now unknown, a dispute arose in 992, and in a
                    battle between the rival fleets, the Anglo-Saxons, notwithstanding the treachery
                    of Elfric, were again victorious. After this the Danes sailed to the north of
                    England and ravaged both sides of the Humber. In 994 Swend, king of the Danes,
                    and Olaf, king of the Norwegians, combined their forces and attacked London, but
                    their attempt was completely frustrated by the valour of the citizens; and they
                    sailed away to accomplish the easier task of ravaging the southern coasts, when
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0589-0568"/> Ethelred as usual did nothing to oppose them, but
                    bought them off with a large sum of money. His efforts at conciliation were
                    completely successful with Olaf, who, after being converted to Christianity, and
                    adopted by Ethelred as his son, remained faithful ever afterwards to his promise
                    of friendship. In the years 997, 998, and 999 the Danes ravaged the coasts of
                    Wessex, Sussex, and Kent. In 1000 Ethelred, energetic at the wrong time and for
                    wrong objects, invaded Normandy, but suffered a disastrous defeat. He concluded
                    a treaty with that country soon afterwards, and in 1002 married Emma, daughter
                    of Richard duke of Normandy. In the spring a treaty had been concluded with the
                    Danes, but in the winter of the same year, Ethelred suspecting that they were
                    plotting treachery, ordered a general massacre of all the Danes in England.
                    Among others murdered was Gunold, sister of Swend; and the Danish king, to
                    revenge her death and that of his countrymen, invaded the coast of Devonshire
                    with a large force. He met with scarcely any opposition, and committed the usual
                    ravages till 1007, when peace was concluded by Ethelred’s consenting, as at
                    other times, to the payment of a large sum of money. In 1009 Ethelred collected
                    the “largest fleet that had been seen in the reign of any king,” but it was soon
                    afterwards nearly wholly destroyed by a violent storm, just before the Danes
                    renewed their invasion. Ethelred, though he had gathered an army, was dissuaded
                    from attacking them by Edric, and afterwards the English, through the treachery
                    of their leaders, suffered a series of defeats; but in 1012 peace was again
                    bought, and Thurkill, one of the Danish leaders, entered the English service. In
                    1013 Swend, with a more formidable fleet than any he had yet collected, sailed
                    up the Humber, and then marched southward to London; but meeting there with a
                    strenuous resistance, he was compelled to give up the attack and marched to
                    Bath. Here he was proclaimed king, apparently by the Witan, and with the general
                    consent of the English people, who were doubtless wearied of Ethelred’s
                    incompetency, of the treachery of the nobles, and of the oppressive taxes which
                    had been paid for no purpose. London itself soon acknowledged the Danish king,
                    and Ethelred, after for a time taking refuge in ThurkilΓs fleet, escaped to
                    Normandy. Swend died on February 1014, and on his death Ethelred was recalled by
                    the Witan, on the promise of ruling better in future. In the same year he
                    defeated Cnut, son of Swend, but in 1015 Cnut renewed his attack with a large
                    fleet, and being joined by the traitor Edric, ravaged Wessex and Mercia, and was
                    preparing to attack London, when Ethelred died April 23, 1016. (See Palgrave’s
