                    correctly applied to this manufacture as to the wax-incised pictures of the
                    ancients. The term is, strictly speaking, applied to tiles which are decorated
                    with patterns formed with different coloured clays, inlaid in the tile, and
                    fired with it. This art appears to have had its origin in the latter part of the
                    12th century, but the culminating point of its excellence and popularity was
                    attained during the 13th; and it was extensively used for the decoration of
                    Gothic buildings in connection with each succeeding change in that style of
                    architecture.</p>
                <p>In mediaeval times the manufacture appears to have been principally carried on in
                    England and Normandy, but examples of ancient tile-pavements of this description
                    are also to be found in Holland and other Continental countries. The greater
                    number of ancient examples are in squares, varying from 4 to 9 inches, but some
                    striking exceptions occur, from which it has been attempted to trace a
                    connection between this art and that of Roman mosaics. Pavements presenting a
                    kind of connecting link between the two have been discovered at Fountains Abbey,
                    and in Prior Crauden ’ s chapel, Ely, in which the tiles are of great variety of
                    form and size; and, instead of the patterns being wholly inlaid in the tiles
                    themselves, the design is, to a large extent, produced by the outlines of the
                    individual pieces, which, in the latter example, are cut to the forms required
                    to be represented, including the subject of the temptation of Adam and Eve,
                    trees, lions, &amp;c., the tesserae being also enriched with what may be more
                    strictly called encaustic decoration.</p>
                <p>Encaustic tiles were almost exclusively used for pavements, but an interesting
                    instance of their employment for wall decoration occurs in the abbey church of
                    Great Malvern, where these tiles have probably been originally used to form a
                    reredos, and bear designs representing Gothic architecture in perspective,
                    having introduced into them the sacred monogram “I.H.S.,” the crowned monogram
                    of “Maria,” the symbols of the Passion, the Royal Arms, and other devices. This
                    example is also interesting as bearing the date of its manufacture on the
                    margin, “Anno R. R. H. VI. XXXVJ.,” that is, the thirty-sixth year of the reign
                    of Henry VI. (1457-8).</p>
                <p>Combinations of encaustic tiles forming a cross were frequently used as mortuary
                    slabs; and an example of this kind of monument is in Worcester cathedral in
                    situ, whilst the detached component tiles are to be found in other ancient
                    churches.</p>
                <p>Many interesting ancient inscriptions are found entering into the designs of
                    encaustic tiles, amongst which is the following, from Great Malvern, which has
                    been deciphered with some difficulty, and rendered into modern English thus—</p>
                <p>’ Think, man, thy life May not ever endure;</p>
                <p>That thou do’st thy self Of that thou art sure;</p>
                <p>But that thou keepest Unto thy executor’s care, If ever it avail thee, It is but
                    chance.”</p>
                <p>A tile from the same place also bears the following quotation from the book of
                    Job, curiously arranged, and beautifully combined with Gothic ornament:
                    “Miseremini mei, miseremini mei saltem, vos amici mei, quia manus Domini tetigit
                    me.” The border of this tile bears the names of the evangelists, with the date
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> MCCCCLλ I. The armorial bearings of noble
                    benefactors, and the devices <pb break="no"

                    enter largely into the decorations of ancient encaustic tiles. Amongst the most
                    interesting examples of these pavements, found in situ, is that in the chapter
                    house at Westminster, which about the year 1840 was laid open to view by the
                    removal of a wooden floor previously covering it. It is probably of the time of
                    Henry III., in whose reign it is recorded ιhat the king’s little chapel at
                    Westminster was paved with “painted tile,”—“mandatum est, &amp;c., quod parvam
                    capellam apud Westm. tegula picta decenter paveari faciatis.” —Rot. Claus. 22
                    Henry III. Μ. 19, 1237-38 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The tiles of this
                    pavement comprise subjects which may be taken to represent the king, queen, and
                    the abbot, also the legend of King Edward the Confessor bestowing a ring, as
                    alms, on St John the Baptist, who appeared to him in the guise of a pilgrim,
                    besides other curious historical designs. The tiles from Chertsey Abbey, Surrey,
                    now in the architectural museum, Westminster, are also amongst the oldest, and,
                    at the same time, the finest and most artistic yet brought to light. They
                    present a remarkable series of illustrations from the English romance of Sir
                    Tristram, and of incidents in the history of Richard Coeur-de-Lion. These tiles
                    were all found in fragments, but have been put together with great care.</p>
                <p>Traces of the ancient manufacture of encaustic tiles have been found in several
                    places in England, and the remains of kilns containing tiles in various stages
                    of manufacture have been discovered at Bawsley, near Lynn, in .the neighbourhood
                    of Droitwich, as well as in other localities, by which an interesting light has
                    been thrown upon the ancient process of production. In almost every instance
                    these tiles were covered with a yellowish glaze, composed principally of lead,
                    similar to that now used in the commoner English earthenware manufactures.</p>
                <p>The modern revival of the art dates from the year 1830, when a patent was
                    granted, with this object, to Samuel Wright, a potter of Shelton, in
                    Staffordshire; but, he having failed to bring his experiments to a profitable
                    result at the expiration of the term, a further extension for seven years was
                    granted him. In the year 1844 his patent right was purchased, in equal shares,
                    by the celebrated china manufacturer Herbert Minton and Mr Fleming St John, the
                    former carrying on the manufacture at Stoke-upon-Trent, and the latter at
                    Worcester, in partnership with Mr George Barr, an eminent china manufacturer of
                    that city. Four years later, the firm of which Mr Minton was the head
                    re-purchased the residue of Mr St John’s share of the patent right, who about
                    the same time relinquished the manufacture. In the year 1850 Messrs Maw &amp;
                    Co. purchased the remaining stock of encaustic tiles at the Worcester china
                    works, and, on the expiration of Mr Wright’s patent, commenced the manufacture
                    on those premises, from which they removed to the present site of their works,
                    at Benthall, near Broseley, Shropshire, whence the marls, peculiarly suitable
                    for the purpose, had previously been obtained.</p>
                <p>The modern manufacture may be described under two heads—viz., the “plastic” and
                    the “semi-dry” or “dust” processes. The former, which was the only one employed
                    up to the year 1863, is in every essential point the same as that used in
                    mediaeval times, differing merely in the greater finish and perfection which
                    modern appliances have effected, and probably also in the material of the
                    moulds. It is not known of what those anciently used were made, but conjecture
                    has suggested wood, fiijd clay, and stone.</p>
                <p>The great difficulty of the manufacture consists in the necessity for introducing
                    into a single tile the variety of different coloured clays or “bodies” which
                    together compose the design, it being essential that they should not only be
                    perfected by the same' amount of heat in the process of firing, but that they
                    should possess an equal contractile power during each stage of the
                    manufacture.</p>
                <p>The tile is first impressed from a plaster-of-Paris mould, bearing the pattern in
                    relief, and set in a brass frame, upon which fits another frame, the dimensions
                    and depth of which correspond with the size and thickness of the tile; the
                    pattern is thus sunk in the clay to a depth of about one-sixteenth of an inch,
                    in the following manner. The workman first introduces into the mould what may be
                    described as a sheet of refined clay of the desired colour for the ground of the
                    pattern; upon this facing, which forms a kind of veneer, is placed a thicker
                    mass of a coarser kind of clay, and the whole is then subjected to screw
                    pressure, which consolidates the two kinds of clays, and at the same time
                    perfectly impresses the pattern of the mould; the superfluous clay is then
                    removed with a scraper, and a second veneering of fine clay, similar to that
                    used for the face, is placed on the back; the tile being removed from the-mould,
                    the depressed parts of the design are filled with clay, of one or more colours,
                    by pouring it in in a “slip” or semi-liquid state. The tile is then set aside
                    for twenty-four hours to stiffen, and when the “slip” inlay has become nearly of
                    the same consistency as the tile itself, the face is brought roughly to an even
                    surface, by “spreading” the soft clay with a pallet-knife. The tile is then
                    further allowed to dry till it attains the stiffness of wax, when it is
                    “finished” by scraping the face with a steel scraper, until the inlaid pattern
                    and ground are developed free from superfluous clay, and the edges are cut true
                    to a square, when it is ready for the drying stove, when the drying, which takes
                    from six to ten days, is completed, the tiles are placed in fire-clay boxes,
                    known as “saggers,” containing from eight to ten each, which are then stacked,
                    one upon another, in the kiln or oven. The process of firing occupies four days
                    and nights, and has to be conducted with the greatest care, as not only the
                    exact size and hardness of the tiles are dependent upon it, but also the
                    perfection of the colours, with which object it is necessary to raise the heat
                    very gradually, and to secure a regular circulation of air in the oven, so as to
                    produce the exact degree of oxidization needed to bring out the desired colours
                    in the materials used for this purpose. The pyrometers used in this part of the
                    process consist of long narrow tiles, and the degree of heat is judged both by
                    their colour and the gradual reduction in length which they undergo, each piece,
                    as it is withdrawn from the oven, being measured in a gauge, with this
                    object,—the total shrinkage of the tile, in the drying and filing, amounting to
                    about 1∣ inches in the foot. For purposes of paving, most of the modern
                    encaustic tiles are used in the “bisque” or unglazed state, the glaze in the
                    ancient tiles having apparently been employed with the object of covering the
                    soft material of the tile itself, and of adding richness to the colour. Where
                    glazing is found necessary in the modern tiles it is effected by dipping them in
                    a combination of lead, alkaline salts, felspar, and silica, finely levigated in
                    water, which is fused by passing them through a kiln specially constructed for
                    the purpose.</p>
                <p>The semi-dry or “dust” process of manufacturing encaustic tiles is an adaptation
                    of an invention patented in the year 1840 by Richard Prosser, by which articles
                    of various kinds are moulded out of pulverized clay, in metal dies, by screw
                    pressure. In the year 1863 Messrs Boulton and Worthington, engineers of Burslem,
                    patented a process by which the use of powdered clay (hitherto only used for
                    tiles of one colour) was applied to the manufacture of encaustic tiles. The
                    design is formed by perforated brass plates,—from one to six or seven being
                    used, according to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0198-0189"/> the nature of the pattern. Where the whole design
                    can be perforated in the.plate without detaching such parts as would represent
                    the ground, only one plate is needed; but where there are several concentric
                    rings or similar forms, additional plates are required. Into the perforations of
                    each plate metal rams, attached to a flat plate of iron, are accurately fitted.
                    The metal die in which the tiles are pressed is composed of a thick block and a
                    square frame or “box;” the latter is connected with levers and a balanceweight,,
                    so that it can be raised or depressed, either forming a hollow mould, of which
                    the face of the block above mentioned forms the bottom, or depressed in such a
                    way as to leave the face of the block standing above it, in which latter
                    position it is ready for the commencement of the process. The perforated plates
                    first mentioned are then, in succession, placed upon the face of the block,
                    being kept in position by two pins fixed to the frame of the die, corresponding
                    with holes made in their margin. The perforations of the brass plate being
                    filled with powdered clay of the desired colour, this is so far compressed, by
                    means of the metal ram, as to allow both the ram and the plate to be removed
                    together, leaving the compressed dust (representing the pattern of the tile in
                    relief) on the block or face plate. In cases where a number of plates are
                    necessary, the pattern is thus built up, each adding such a part as can be
                    perforated∙in a single plate. The frame is then raised, so as to form a mould of
                    the required depth, which being filled with powdered clay, intended to form both
                    the ground of the pattern and the substance of the tile, the whole mould or die
                    is slid, in a groove provided for the purpose, under the screw press, to which
                    is attached a plate covering the mould, and resting on the top of the movable
                    frame; this, on pressure being applied, forces down the frame until the powdered
                    clay is thoroughly consolidated and incorporated with that part forming the
                    design. On the pressure being relieved, the die is drawn from beneath the press,
                    the frame is forced down by means of the levers to which it is attached, and the
                    tile is left resting, face downwards, on the block, when it is ready for the
                    drying-stove, the subsequent treatment being the same as in the plastic process.
                    This process affords the advantage of much greater rapidity in execution than
                    can be effected by the plastic method, and as the tile undergoes little·or no
                    shrinkage in the desiccation of the small amount of moisture which is needed to
                    make the particle3 of the dust combine under pressure, the risk of distortion in
                    the process of drying is'reduced to a minimum, but the heavy prime cost of the
                    perforated brass plates necessarily confines this otherwise valuable invention
                    to such designs as are most largely in demand.</p>
                <p>The modern application of encaustic tiles is by no means confined to the
                    ecclesiastical purposes for which they were mainly used in mediaeval times,
                    although for this purpose many of the ancient designs have been reproduced, and
                    the rough execution of the old examples has been imitated with striking
                    fidelity. Some of the most eminent architects of recent years have exercised
                    their skill in the production of designs more suitable for domestic purposes;
                    and pavements of these tiles, combined with other kindred manufactures (for
                    which see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mosaics</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tiles),</hi> have become an almost universal part of the permanent decoration
                    of the better class of public and private buildings, for which purpose they are
                    also largely exported to the colonies and foreign countries, superseding the
                    perishable forms of flooring, and at the same time rendering unnecessary any
                    decorative coverings. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. μ.)</hi></p>
