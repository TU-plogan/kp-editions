                    liberty of the subject that it has seldom been introduced save in some supreme
                    financial exigency, and has as seldom been borne, even after long usage, with
                    less than the ordinary impatience of taxation. Yet excise duties can boast a
                    respectable antiquity, having a distinct parallel in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vectigal rerum venalium</hi> (or toll levied on all commodities sold by auction
                    or in public market) of the Romans. But the Roman excise was mild compared with
                    that of modern nations, having never been more than <hi rend="italic"
                    >centesima,</hi> or one per cent., of the value; and it was much shorter-lived
                    than the modern examples, having been first imposed by Augustus, reduced for a
                    time one-half by Tiberius, and finally abolished by Caligula, 38 A.υ., so that
                    the Roman excise cannot have had a duration of much more than half a century.
                    Its remission must have been deemed a great boon in the marts of Rome, since it
                    was commemorated by the issue of small brass coins with the legend <hi
                    rend="italic">Remissis Centesimis,</hi> specimens of which are still to be found
                    in collections.</p>
                <p>The history of this branch of revenue in the United Kingdom dates from the period
                    of the civil wars, when the republican Government, following the example of
                    Holland, established, as a means of defraying the heavy expenditure of the time,
                    various duties of excise, which the Royalists when restored to power found too
                    convenient or necessary to be abandoned, notwithstanding their Roundhead origin
                    and general unpopularity. On the contrary, they were destined to be steadily
                    increased both in number and in amount. It is curious that the first commodities
                    selected for excise were those to which this branch of taxation, after great
                    extension, has again in the age of reform and free trade been in a manner
                    permanently reduced, viz., malt liquors, and such kindred beverages as cider,
                    perry, and spruce beer. The other excise duties remaining are chiefly in the
                    form of licences, such as to kill game and to use and carry guns, to sell gold
                    and silver plate, to pursue the business of appraisers or auctioneers, hawkers
                    or pedlars, pawnbrokers, or patent-medicine vendors, to manufacture tobacco or
                    snuff, to deal in sweets or in foreign wines, to make vinegar, to roast malt, or
                    to use a still in chemistry or otherwise. It may be presumed that the policy of
                    the licence duties is not so much to collect revenue, though in the aggregate
                    they yield a large sum, as to guard the main sources of excise, and to place
                    certain classes of dealers, by registration and an annual payment to the
                    exchequer, under a direct legal responsibility. The excise system of the United
                    Kingdom as now pruned and reformed, however, while still the most prolific of
                    all the sources of revenue, is simple in process, and is contentedly borne as
                    compared with what was the case in the last and the beginning of the present
                    century. The wars with Bonaparte strained the Government resources to the
                    uttermost, and excise duties were multiplied and increased in every practicable
                    form. Bricks, candles, calico prints, glas3, hides and skins, leather, paper,
                    salt, soap, and other commodities of home manufacture and consumption were
                    placed, with their respective industries, under excise surveillance and fine.
                    When the duties could no longer be increased in number, they were raised in
                    rate. The duty on British spirits, which had begun at a few pence per gallon in
                    1660, rose step by step to Ils. 8¾d. per gallon in 1820; and the duty on salt
                    was augmented to three or fourfold its value.</p>
                <p>The old unpopularity of excise, though now somewhat out of date, must have had
                    real enough grounds. It breaks out in all our literature, from songs and
                    pasquinades to grave political essays and legal commentaries. Blackstone, in
                    quoting the declaration of parliament in 1649 that “excise is the most easy and
                    indifferent levy that can be laid upon the people,” adds on his own authority
                    that “from its first original to the present time its very name has been odious
                    to the people of England” (book i. cap. 8, tenth edition, 1786); while the
                    definition of “excise” gravely inserted by Dr Johnson in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary,</hi> at the imminent risk of subjecting the eminent author to a
                    prosecution for libel—viz., “a hateful tax levied upon commodities, and adjudged
                    not by the common judges of property, but wretches hired by those to whom excise
                    is paid ”—can hardly be ever forgotten. The levy of excise has more than the
                    disagreeableness of other direct taxation, and though not more inquisitorial
                    than income tax, establishes an espionage and control over premises and
                    processes of manufacture which are much more offensive as well as sometimes
                    injurious. The caustic feeling of last century points directly enough to much
                    rough and arbitrary administration, which it was possible gradually to correct
                    and mitigate.</p>
                <p>But what may be deemed the permanent defect of excise is that it is apt to
                    increase the cost of commodities to consumers far more than the amount of duty
                    levied for the revenue. This has been found on the abolition of excise, whether
                    on bricks, calicoes, leather, paper, or other articles of manufacture. The
                    cheapening effect might not be very immediate or apparent, because the duty when
                    abolished might bear only a very fractional proportion to tho natural value of
                    the goods; but under the greater freedom of production have arisen more
                    invention, more skilful and varied appliances, and consequently more economy to
                    consumers, and more expansion of the several industries, than could have been
                    attained under the fiscal restrictions. The inexpediency, even for revenue
                    purposes, of fining and fettering a great number of the most useful and
                    necessary home industries by this kind of impost would seem to be abundantly
                    demonstrated by the fact that the excise revenue of the United Kingdom, while
                    being reduced always within narrower compass, has not suffered eventually in its
                    actual produce to the state. The revenue from excise has never been greater, or
                    much greater, than it is at present. The gross receipts from excise in 1820 were
                    .£27,955,810.</p>

                    same date 1877, when excise for some years had been almost wholly confined to
                    British spirits and malt liquors, the net revenue was £27,681,523. The following

                <p>So large a revenue from so few sources indicates high duties, and the excise on
                    spirits in particular has been maintained during many years at a rate that would
                    have astonished the people of last century, and yet without any of the evils
                    incident to heavy fiscal exaction. There is a check, which has been often
                    exemplified, to the increase of the rate of excise in the encouragement it gives
                    to illicit manufacture, and the consequent defeat of its object, viz., increase
                    of revenue. The high rates of Ils. 8∣d. per gallon in England, 6s. 2d. in
                    Scotland, and 5s. 7d, in Ireland, to which the excise on home-made spirits was
                    increased at the close of the great wars, gave rise to so much evasion that
                    “more than one-half of the spirits actually consumed in Scotland and Ireland,”
                    as we learn from an official source, “were supplied by the Smuggler.” The duties
                    were reduced to 7 s. per gallon in England, and to 2s. 4∣d. in both the other
                    countries. “The result of these changes was a most surprising increase of
                    legally made spirits. In 1820 the quantity made in the United Kingdom, and
                    retained forborne consumption, was 9,600,000 gallons. In 1826 ”—two years after
                    the change of duties—“it was 18,200,000” <hi rend="italic">(First Report of
                    Commissioners of Inland Revenue,</hi> 1857). At subsequent periods, when the
                    duties were again moderately increased, it was found that there was a sharp
                    limit to the process, and that the excise on spirits could not be advanced much
                    beyond 3s. 4d. in Scotland and Ireland without a revival of the old evils and a
                    decline of revenue; while in England more than 7s. encouraged adulteration, and
                    much higher prices than were justified by the duty and other trade charges.
                    Later experience shows that this check is elastic. Since 1860 the excise on
                    home-made spirits has been 10s. per gallon uuiformly in the three kingdoms, and
                    yet in no previous period have there been fewer complaints of smuggling or
                    illicit distillation. This result is ascribable to various causes. The increase
                    of employment, higher wages for legitimate labour, the opening of all parts of
                    the country by means of communication, the greater sway of the law, and the
                    greater influence of habits of order, must have discouraged the dark though
                    tempting business of smuggling quite as much or more than the enormously high
                    excise encouraged it. The excise service itself has also been much improved, and
                    by simple mechanical provisions in the distilleries much less supervision of
                    officers is requisite, with greater security against fraud than in former times.
                    The exemption from duty of methylated spirit, used extensively in “French
                    polishing” and many other arts, has likewise had a beneficial effect in stamping
                    out illicit distillation. The spirit of wine, or pure alcohol of the druggists,
                    however, is still almost necessarily subject to duty, though it were certainly
                    desirable that in tinctures and other medicaments incapable of being abused as
                    potable liquors, it should be free of tax. But permission to prepare tinctures
                    in bond, in quantities of not less than nine gallons, has not as yet been taken
                    advantage of to any extent. In the export of spirit of wine a rebate of duty is
                    allowed.</p>
                <p>The duty on malt, like that on spirits, has also for soma years been uniform in
                    the United Kingdom, at the rate of 2s. 7|d. per bushel, with a further duty on
                    brewers of 12s. 6d. for every 12^ quarters mashed, or, what is held equivalent,
                    every 50 barrels of 36 gallons brewed. The duty on each gallon of ale is thus
                    barely one and seveneighths of a penny—a very lenient excise compared with the
                    10s. per gallon on spirits. It might be supposed that when the duty on spirits
                    in Scotland and Ireland was made as high as in England, a certain equality
                    should have been established in the incidence of taxation on the liquors most
                    generally used in the several countries. But the legislature has favoured the
                    milder fermented liquors with the view of promoting temperance in all parts of
                    the kingdom, irrespective of taste, habit, or climate. How far this good
                    intention has been realized is a question aside from these explanatory remarks
                    on excise. It has only to be observed that while the consumption of brewed
                    liquors has been increasing in Scotland, the consumption of distilled spirits in
                    England has been increasing in a still greater proportion. The following are the
                    official returns of spirits and malt charged with duty in the three kingdoms in
                    1867 and 1876</p>

                <p>The abolition of many of the old excise duties, and consequent simplification of
                    the department, prepared the way for an administrative reform, by which the
                    three revenue branches of excise, stamps, and taxes were placed under the
                    superintendence of one board of commissioners, and included in the general
                    description of inland revenue. This was accomplished in 1848, and the board of
                    excise left its old head quarters in Gresham House and was merged in the new
                    body in Somerset House, by which the colle tιυn and management of the whole
                    inland revenue has Since been directed. The provisions for the consolidation and
                    guidance of the board of inland revenue are embodied in the Act 12 Vict. cap. 1.
                    The numerous statutes of excise, well annotated, have been collected and
                    published under the authority of the commissioners of inland revenue, in one
                    volume (1873). <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi> so.)</p>
