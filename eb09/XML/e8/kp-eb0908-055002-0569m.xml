                    the Asmonean. As to the circumstances under which they arose, the precise causes
                    in Jewish life to which they owed their origin, and the various stages by which
                    they attained to the elaborate organization of later times, we have no positive
                    information whatever. The accounts we have of them refer particularly to the
                    half century preceding the fall of Jerusalem, when the growth and organization
                    of the sect were complete. Besides the detailed account of Josephus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Bell. Jud.,</hi> ii. 8; briefly in <hi rend="italic">Antig.,</hi>
                    xviii. 1, 5), we have a sketch of them in Philo (in his treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">Quod</hi><hi rend="italic">omnis probus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >liber,</hi> and in the fragment of his <hi rend="italic">Apology for the
                    Jews</hi> preserved in Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">Pr. Evang.,</hi> viii. 11),
                    and a brief notice from Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Hist. E^at.,</hi> v. 17).
                    Josephus himself made trial of the sect of Essenes in his youth; but from his
                    own statement it appears that he must have been a very short time with them, and
                    therefore could not have been initiated into the inner mysteries of the society
                    <hi rend="italic">{De vita sηa,</hi> 2).</p>
                <p>There is no little difficulty about their name. Josephus generally writes
                    Έσστ/νοι, but has Eσσα7oι sometimes; Philo has Έσσαίοι, and Pliny Esseni. Its
                    derivation is quite uncertain, all the more so as the origin of the sect is
                    totally unknown. The most extraordinary conjecture is that of Philo, who
                    connects it with 6σ∙ιoς, holy; Salmasius proposed the Syrian city Essa; Ewald
                    refers it to the “Rabbinical ∣∙t∏ (properly, preserver, guardian), and supposes
                    that the Essenes called themselves so as watchers, servants (of God), since they
                    did not in fact purpose to be anything more than <hi rend="italic">θipαπwταa
                    θeοv,</hi> as Philo says.” The most probable root is K□X, to heal, suggested by
                    several authorities, which also is analogous to <hi rend="italic"
                    >θepaπevτaf</hi> the name of the kindred sect in Egypt. (For a full discussion
                    of the name of the sect, see Canon Lightfoot on the Colossians.)</p>
                <p>The Essenes were an exclusive society, distinguished from the rest of the Jewish
                    nation in Palestine by an organization peculiar to themselves, and by a theory
                    of life in which a severe asceticism and a rare benevolence to one another and
                    to mankind in general were the most striking characteristics. They had fixed
                    rules for initiation, a succession of strictly separate grades within the limits
                    of the society, and regulations for the conduct of their daily life even in its
                    minutest details. Their membership could be recruited only from the outside
                    world, as marriage and all intercourse with women were absolutely renounced.
                    They were the first society in the world to condemn slavery both in theory and
                    practice; they enforced and practised the most complete community of goods. They
                    chose their own priests and public office-bearers, and even their own judges.
                    Though their prevailing tendency was practical, and the tenets of the society
                    were kept a profouud secret, it is perfectly clear from the concurrent testimony
                    of Philo and Josephus that they cultivated a kind of speculation, which not only
                    accounts for their spiritual asceticism, but indicates a great deviation from
                    the normal development of Judaism, and a profound sympathy with Greek
                    philosophy, and probably also with Oriental ideas. At the same time we do our
                    Jewish authorities no injustice iu imputing to them the patriotic tendency to
                    idealize the society, and thus offer to their readers something in Jewish life
                    that would bear comparison at least with similar manifestations of Gentile
                    life.</p>
                <p>There is some little difficulty in determining how far the Essenes separated
                    themselves locally from their fellow countrymen. Josephus informs us that they
                    had no single city of their own, but that many of them dwelt in every city.
                    While in his treatise <hi rend="italic">Quod</hi><hi rend="italic">omnis,</hi>
                    &amp;c., Philo speakβ of their avoiding towns and preferring to live in
                    villages, in his <hi rend="italic">Apology for the Jews</hi> we find them living
                    in many cities, villages, and in great and prosperous towns. In Pliny they are a
                    perennial colony settled on the western shore of the Dead Sea. On the whole, as
                    Philo and Josephus agree in estimating their number at four thousand, we are
                    justified in suspecting some exaggeration as to the many cities, towns, and
                    villages where they were said to be found. As agriculture was their favourite
                    occupation, and as their tendency’ was to withdraw from the haunts and ordinary
                    interests of mankind, we may assume that with the growing confusion and
                    corruption of Jewish society, they felt themselves attracted from the mass of
                    the population to the sparsely peopled districts, till they found a congenial
                    settlement and free scope for their peculiar view of life by the shore of the
                    Dead Sea. While their principles were consistent with the neighbourhood of men,
                    they were better adapted to a state of seclusion.</p>
                <p>The Essenes did not renounce marriage because they denied the validity of the
                    institution or the necessity of it as providing for the continuance of the human
                    race, but because they were convinced of the artfulness and fickleness of the
                    sex. They adopted children when very young, and brought them up on their own
                    principles. Pleasure generally they rejected as evil. They despised riches not
                    less than pleasure; neither poverty nor wealth was observable among them; at
                    initiation every one gave his property into the common stock; every member in
                    receipt of wages handed them over to the funds of the society. In matters of
                    dress the asceticism of the society was very pronounced. They regarded oil as a
                    defilement, even washing it off if anointed with it against their will. They did
                    not change <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0570-0551"/> their clothes or their shoes till they were tom
                    in pieces or worn completely away. In general they thought it good to dress
                    coarsely, and preferred to be clad in white. Their daily routine was prescribed
                    for them in the strictest manner. Before the rising of the sun they were to
                    speak of nothing profane, but offered to it certain traditional forms of prayer
                    as if beseeching it to rise. Thereafter they went about their daily tasks,
                    working continuously at whatever trade they knew 111 the fifth hour, when they
                    assembled, and, girding on a garment of linen, bathed in cold water. They next
                    seated themselves quietly in the dining hall, where the baker set bread in
                    order, and the cook brought each a single dish of one kind of food. Before meat
                    and after it grace was said by a priest. After dinner they resumed work till
                    sunset. In the evening they had supper, in which strangers belonging to the
                    society joined them, if there happened to be any such present. Withal there was
                    no noise or confusion to mar the tranquillity of their intercourse; no one
                    usurped more than his share of the conversation; the stillness of the place
                    oppressed a stranger with a feeling of mysterious awe. This composure of spirit
                    was owing to their perfect temperance in eating and drinking. Not only in the
                    daily routine of the society, but generally, the activity of the members was
                    controlled by their presidents. In only two things could they take the
                    initiative, helpfulness and m^rcy; the deserving poor and the destitute were to
                    receive instant relief; but no member could give anything to his relatives
                    without consulting the heads of the society. Their office-bearers were elected.
                    They had also their special courts of justice, which were composed of not less
                    than a hundred members, and their decisions, which were arrived at with extreme
                    care, were irreversible. Oaths were strictly forbidden; their word was stronger
                    than an oath. They were just and temperate in anger, the guardians of good
                    faith, and the ministers of peace, obedient to their elders and to the majority.
                    But the moral characteristics which they most earnestly cultivated and enjoined
                    will best appear in their rules of initiation. There was a novitiate of three
                    years, during which the intending member was tested as to his fitness for
                    entering the society. If the result was satisfactory, he was admitted, but
                    before partaking of the common meal, he was required to swear awful oaths, that
                    he would reverence the deity, do justice to men, hurt no man voluntarily or at
                    the command of another, hate the unjust and assist the just, and that he would
                    render fidelity to all men, but especially to the rulers, seeing that no one
                    rules but of God. He also vowed, if he should bear rule himself, to make no
                    violent use of his power, nor outshine those set under him by superior display,
                    to make it his aim to cherish the truth and unmask liars, to be pure from theft
                    and unjust gain, to conceal nothing from his fellow-members, nor to divulge any
                    of their affairs to other men, even at the risk of death, to transmit their
                    doctrines unchanged, and to keep secret the books of the society and the names
                    of the angels.</p>
                <p>Within the limits of the society there were four grades so distinct that if any
                    one touched a member of an inferior grade he required to cleanse himself by
                    bathing in water; members that had been found guilty of serious crimes were
                    expelled from the society, and could not be received again till reduced to the
                    very last extremity of want or sickness. As the result of the ascetic training
                    of the Essenes, and of their temperate diet, we find that they lived to a great
                    age, and were superior to pain and fear. During the Roman war they cheerfully
                    underwent the most grievous tortures rather than break any of the principles of
                    their faith. In fact, they had in many respects reached the very highest moral
                    elevation attained by the ancient world; they were just, humane, benevolent, and
                    spiritually-minded; the sick and aged were the objects of a special affectionate
                    regard; and they condemned slavery, not only as an injustice, but as an impious
                    violation of the natural brotherhood of men. There were some of the Essenes who
                    permitted marriage, but strictly with a view to the preservation of the race; in
                    other respects, they agreed with the main body of the society.</p>
                <p>It will be apparent that the predominant tendency of the society was practical
                    Phile tells us expressly that they rejected logic as unnecessary to the
                    acquisition of virtue, and speculation on nature as too lofty for the human
                    intellect. Yet they had views of their own as to God, Providence, the soul, and
                    a future state, which, while they had a practical use, w ere yet essentially
                    speculative. On the one hand, indeed, they held tenaciously by the traditional
                    Judaisms: blasphemy against their lawgiver was punished with death, the sacred
                    books were preserved and read with great reverence, though not w ithout an
                    allegorical interpretation, and the Sabbath was most scrupulously observed. But
                    in many important points their deviation from the strait path of Judaic
                    development was complete. They rejected animal sacrifice as well as marriage;
                    the oil with which priests and kings were anointed they accounted unclean; and
                    the condemnation of oaths and the community of goods were unmistakable
                    innovations for which they found no hint or warrant in the old Hebrew writings.
                    Their most singular feature, perhaps, was their reverence for the sun. As we
                    have seen, no profane word was to be uttered before his rising, and certain
                    forms of prayer were offered to him; they were not to insult his rays by any act
                    of uncleanness, however natural. In their speculative hints respecting the soul
                    and a future state, we find another important deviation from Judaism, and the
                    explanation of their asceticism. They held that the body is mortal, and its
                    substance transitory: that the soul is immortal, but, coming from the subtlest
                    ether, is lured as by a sorcery of nature into the prison-house of the body. At
                    death it is released from its bonds, as from long slavery, and joyously soars
                    aloft. To the souls of the good there is reserved a life beyond the ocean, and a
                    country oppressed neither by rain, nor snow, nor heat, but refreshed by a gentle
                    west wind blowing continually from the sea, but to the wicked a region of wintry
                    darkness and of unceasing torment. (In these points the resemblance of Essenism
                    to certain phases of Greek philosophy and to some of the earlier Greek myths is
                    unmistakable.) To all intensely earnest minds, in which the force of one great
                    idea is not corrected by other tendencies, a spiritual asceticism is the natural
                    complement of a theory according to which a vile body is the prisonhouse of an
                    immortal soul. Josephus tells us, too, that the Essenes believed in fate; but in
                    what sense, and what relation it bore to Divine Providence, does not appear.</p>
                <p>In view of such divergencies from the normal development of Judaism, and of
                    doctrines on the soul and a future state, which so closely resemble Pythagorean,
                    Platonic, and even Zoroastrian speculations, the question naturally arises how
                    far Essenism was a native product of the Jew ish mind, and how far it had
                    experienced the influence of Greek and Oriental thought. On the one hand it is
                    clear, from the facts we have noted, that it must have completely passed the
                    barriers of traditional Judaism, and equally clear, on the other, that they
                    could not have reached their peculiar point of view in perfect isolation from
                    antecedent and contemporary speculation. For more than a century before the
                    Essenes appear as a factor in Jewish history, the Jews had come into closest
                    contact with Greek life; doubtless they were rather repelled than attracted, but
                    in either case could not help being affected, by it. W ith the theosophic
                    speculations of Persia they had also been acquainted for many centuries, first
                    during the Babylonian captivity, and afterwards through the general diffusion of
                    that way of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n571/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0571-0552"/> thought in the adjoining countries. All this
                    influence had greatly modified the opinions of the Jews. Nations cannot
                    altogether select the medium in which they live, nor resist its influence,
                    however vigorously they cling to an hereditary faith. Whatever they may have
                    acquired in their intercourse with Persia must have already passed into Jewish
                    thought generally, and probably had no special connexion with the origin of the
                    Essenes; but may we not assume with Zeller some direct and express influence of
                    the Neo-Pythagoreans as that which gave Essenism its distinctive characteri As
                    Josephus himself says, the Essenes live the same kind of life as the
                    Pythagoreans. The Essenes certainly did realize the Pythagorean ideal. In
                    beliefs, institutions, and tendencies we are struck by their close resemblance.
                    It is not impossible they were directly connected. Still the second century
                    before Christ is too early a date to look for such a strong manifestation of
                    Neo-Pythagoreanism on Jewish soil. Besides we have all the data for explaining
                    the origin of the Essenes without supposing any direct influence of the
                    Neo-Pythagorean school. Greek culture was widely diffused among the Jews; the
                    Greek philosophy was accessible to their scholars; Jewish thought could not but
                    obey the impulse of the dominant civilization, and could not avoid more or less
                    completely moving in parallel directions. So much must be conceded as to the
                    medium in which the thoughtful Jewish intellect lived. On the other hand, like
                    causes produce like results in all countries. Certain conditions of civilization
                    have favoured the formation of secret societies, with analogous institutions, in
                    all ages. Accordingly, while we cannot fail to perceive a general affinity to
                    Greek and Oriental thought in the tenets and institutions of the Essenes, we see
                    still more clearly the proverbial intensity of the Jews, seeking in an organized
                    seclusion from the world that satisfaction which they could not find in a
                    disturbed and decaying national life. The Jewish people were unhappily hastening
                    to the final catastrophe; misrule, corruption, and fanaticism were everywhere
                    gathering head; good men despaired of controlling such a headlong and turbulent
                    movement; what could they do but withdraw from it, and cultivate a purer life
                    under such conditions as secured or admitted it, in the exclusive society of men
                    like-minded with themselves?</p>
                <p>The original sources of our knowledge of the Essenes have been mentioned at the
