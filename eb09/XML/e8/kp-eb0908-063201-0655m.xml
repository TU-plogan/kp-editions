                    the left bank of the Thames, 21 miles W.S.W. of London, and is connected with
                    Windsor on the opposite bank of the river by a cast-iron bridge erected in 1824.
                    Eton is chiefly celebrated for its college, founded by Henry VI. in 1441, and
                    endowed mainly from the revenues of the alien priories which were suppressed by
                    Henry V. By Edward IV. its possessions were considerably curtailed; but on
                    account of benefactions and the rise in the value of property, its annual income
                    has gradually increased from £652 in the year 1506 till it now exceeds
                    &lt;£20,000. The original foundation consisted of a provost, 10 priests, 4
                    clerks, 6 choristers, a schoolmaster, 25 poor and indigent scholars, and the
                    same number of poor men or beadsmen. In 1443 the number of scholars was
                    increased to 70, and the number of beadsmen reduced to 13. Until lately the
                    government of the college was in the hands of the provost and fellows; but in
                    1870 the commissioners authorized by the Act of" Parliament of 1868 appointed
                    the “new governing body” of Eton to consist of the provost of Eton, the provost
                    of King’s College, Cambridge, 5 representatives nominated respectively by the
                    university of Oxford, the university of Cambridge, the Royal Society, the lord
                    chief justice, and the masters, and 4 representatives chosen by the rest of the
                    governing body. By this governing body the foundation was in 1872 made to
                    consist of a provost and 10 fellows (not priests, but merely the other members
                    of the governing body other than the provost), a headmaster of the school, and a
                    lower master, at least 70 scholars, and not more than, two chaplains or
                    conducts. Originally it was necessary that the scholars should be born in
                    England, of lawfully married parents, and be between eight and sixteen years of
                    age; but according to the statutes of 1872, the scholarships are now open to all
                    boys who are British subjects, and between twelve and fifteen years of age. A
                    number of foundation scholarships for King’s College, Cambridge, are open for
                    competition amongst the boys; and there are besides several valuable extra
                    scholarships and exhibitions, most of which are tenable only at Cambridge, some
                    at Oxford, and some at either university. Besides the scholars of the
                    foundation, Eton College is attended by about 850 scholars, who are either
                    boarded with the masters or reside in private houses, and are called “oppidans.”
                    The total expenses of a boy educated as an oppidan average £200 a year. At one
                    time the course of instruction was almost wholly classical; and although there
                    were masters for other subjects, these were unconnected with the general
                    business of the school, and were attended at extra hours. But in 1851
                    mathematics was incorporated into the curriculum of the school, and in 1869
                    physical science was introduced as a regular subject. The teachers of modern
                    languages, of mathematics, and of physical science have now the same status, in
                    regard to authority in and out of school, as the teachers of Latin and Greek.
                    Among the celebrated men educated at Eton may be mentioned Sir Robert Walpole,
                    Harley earl of Oxford, Lord Bolingbroke, Earl Camden, the famous earl of
                    Chatham, the Hon. Robert Boyle, Lord Lyttelton, Gray, Shelley, Horace Walpole,
                    West, Waller, Fox, Canning, the marquis of Wellesley, Hallam the historian, the
                    duke of Wellington, Dean Milman, and the earl of Derby. The singular custom
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">montem,</hi> which was observed here triennially on
                    Whit-Tuesday, has now been abolished. The last celebration of it took [&gt;lace
                    in 1844. It consisted of a procession of the boys in a kind of military order,
                    with flags and music, headed by their “captain,” to a small mound called Salt
                    Hill, near the Bath road, where they levied contributions, or “salt,” from the
                    passers-by and spectators. The sum collected sometimes exceeded £1000,—the
                    surplus, after deducting certain expenses, becoming the property of the
                    “captain” of the school. The building of Eton College was commenced in 1441, and
                    the school was opened in 1442; but the whole original structure was not
                    completed till fifty years afterwards. A new wing was completed in 1846; another
                    block of buildings, containing 15 class-rooms, a music room, and an observatory,
                    was built in 1861; these have been subsequently enlarged, and since the
                    incorporation of physical science into the course of studies, an admirable
                    chemical laboratory has been erected. The older buildings consist of two
                    quadrangles, built partly of freestone but chiefly of brick. The outer
                    quadrangle, or schoolyard, is inclosed by the chapel, schools, dormitories, and
                    masters’ chambers, and has in its centre a bronze statue of the royal founder.
                    The buildings inclosing the inner or lesser quadrangle contain the residence of
                    the fellows, the library, hall, and various offices. The chapel, on the south
                    side of the outer court, is a fine Gothic edifice, containing some interesting
                    monuments, among which is one to Sir Henry Wotton, who was long provost of the
                    college; and at the west end of the ante-chapel is a fine marble statue of the
                    founder in his royal robes, by Bacon. The chapel <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0656-0633"/> has lately been beautified and decorated, and a
                    number of stained-glass windows have been introduced. The library contains a
                    curious and valuable collection of books, a collection of Oriental and Egyptian
                    manuscripts, and some beautifully illuminated missals. There is also a large
                    library for the use of the boys. From the foundation of Eton College the college
                    chapel was used as the parish church until 1854, when a handsome chapel-of-ease
                    was erected at the cost of £8000. With the secularization of the college, the
                    parish of Eton was in 1875 erected into an independent vicarage with the former
                    chapel-of-ease as its parish church. In 1871 the population of the local board
                    district of Eton (exclusive of the Eton boys) was 2806; of the parish, 3261.</p>
