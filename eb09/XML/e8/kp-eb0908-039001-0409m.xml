                <p><label type="entry">ENGLISH LANGUAGE</label>. In its widest sense, the name is
                    now conveniently used to comprehend the language of the English people from
                    their settlement in Britain to the present day, the various stages through which
                    it has passed being distinguished as Old, Middle, and New or Modern English. In
                    works yet recent, and even in some still current, the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >English</hi> is confined to the third, or at most extended to the second and
                    third of these stages, since the language assumed in the main the vocabulary and
                    grammatical forms which it now presents, the oldest or inflected stage being
                    treated as a separate language, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anglo-Saxon,</hi> while the transition period which connects the two has been
                    called <hi rend="italic">Semi-Saxon.</hi> This view had the justification that,
                    looked upon by themselves, either as vehicles of thought or as objects of study
                    and analysis, Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, and Modern English are, for all
                    practical ends, distinct languages,—as much so, for example, as Latin and
                    Spanish. No amount of familiarity with Modern English, including its local
                    dialects, would enable the student to read Anglo-Saxon, three-fourths of the
                    vocabulary of which have perished and been reconstructed within 800 years;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A careful examination of
                    several letters of Bosworth’s Anglo-Saxon Dictionary gives in 2000 words
                    (including derivatives and compounds, but excluding orthographic variants! 535
                    which still exist as modern English words.</p></note> nor would a knowledge even
                    of these lost words give him the power, since the grammatical system, alike in
                    accidence and syntax, would be entirely strange to him. Indeed, it is probable
                    that a modern Englishman would acquire the power of reading and writing French
                    in less time than it would cost him to attain to the same proficiency in Old
                    English; so that if the test of distinct languages be their degree of practical
                    difference from each other, it cannot be denied that “Anglo-Saxon” is a distinct
                    language from Modern English. But when we view the subject historically,
                    recognizing the fact that living speech is subject to continuous change in
                    certain definite directions, determined by the constitution and circumstances of
                    mankind, as an evolution or development of which we can trace the steps, and
                    that, owing to the abundance of written materials, this evolution appears so
                    gradual in English that we can nowhere draw distinct lines separating its
                    successive stages, we recognize these stages as merely temporary phases of an
                    individual whole, and speak of the English language as used alike by Cynewulf
                    and by Tennyson, just as we include alike King Alfred and Mr Bright as members
                    of the English race.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    practical convenience of having one name for what was the same thing in various
                    stages of development is not affected by the probability that (Mr Freeman
                    notwithstanding) <hi rend="italic">Engle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Englisc</hi>
                    were, at an early period, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> applied to the whole of our
                    Teutonic ancestors in Britain, but only to a part of them. The dialects of <hi
                    rend="italic">Engle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Seαxαn</hi> were alike old forms
                    of what was afterwards Englis)ι speech, and so, viewed in relation to it, <hi
                    rend="italic">Old English,</hi> whatever their contemporary names might
                    be.</p></note> It must not be forgotten, however, that in this wide sense the
                    English language includes, not only the literary or courtly forms of speech used
                    at successive periods, but also the popular and, it may be, altogether unwritten
                    dialects that exist by their side. Only on this basis, indeed, can we speak of
                    Old, Middle, anl Modern English as the same <hi rend="italic">language,</hi>
                    since in actual fact the precise <hi rend="italic">dialect</hi> which is now the
                    cultivated language, or “English” par excellence, is not the descendant of that
                    dialect which was the cultivated language or English of Alfred, but of a sister
                    dialect then sunk in obscurity,—even as the direct descendant of Alfred’s
                    “Englisc” is now tobe found in the neglected and non-literary rustic speech of
                    Wiltshire and Somersetshire. Causes which, linguistically considered, are
                    external and accidental, have shifted the political and intellectual centre of
                    England, and along with it transferred literary and courtly patronage from one
                    form of English to another; if the centre of influence had happened to be fixed
                    at York or on the banks of the Forth, both would probably have been neglected
                    for a third.</p>
                <p>The English language, thus defined, is not “native” to Britain, that is, it was
                    not found here at the dawn of history, but was introduced by foreign immigrants
                    at a date many centuries later. At the Roman Conquest of the island, the
                    languages spoken by the natives belonged all (so far as is known) to the Celtic
                    branch of the Aryan family, modern forms of which still survive in Wales,
                    Ireland, the Scottish Highlands, Isle of Man, and Brittany, while one has quite
                    recently become extinct in Cornwall. Dialects allied to Welsh and Cornish were
                    apparently spoken over the greater part of Britain, as far north as the Firths
                    of Forth and Clyde; beyond these estuaries and in the isles to the west,
                    including Ireland and Man, dialects akin to Irish and Scottish Gaelic prevailed.
                    The dialect of the Picts in the east of Scotland, according to recent inquiries,
                    presented characteristics uniting the British or Cymric with the Gaelic
                    division.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As to the

                    Prof. Rhys says “the Picts, Mr Skeno notwithstanding, were probably Kymric

                    from the close of the Middle Ages to the present day, or to the whole duration
                    of Modern English—familiarized the provincial inhabitants with Latin, which was
                    probably the ordinary speech of the <pb break="no"

                    linguistic history of Britain might have been not different from that of Gaul,
                    Spain, and the other provinces of the Western Empire, where a rustic Latin
                    giving birth to a neo-Latinic language finally superseded the native one except
                    in remote and mountainous districts,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    conquests of the 5th and 6th centuries.</p>
                <p>The Angles, Saxons, and their allies belonged to the Teutonic or Gothic branch of
                    the Aryan family, represented in modern times not only by the English and their
                    colonies, but by the populations of Germany, Holland, Denmark, and the
                    Scandinavian peninsula, and found at the dawn of history located between and
                    about the estuaries and lower courses of the Rhine and the Weser, and the
                    adjacent coasts and isles. For more than 1000 years the Teutonic or Gothic stock
                    has been divided into the three branches of the Low German, High German, and
                    Scandinavian, of which the former represents the original stock, the two others
                    being offshoots to the south and north respectively. To it also belonged the
                    Moeso-Gothic, the tongue of certain Germans who, passing down the Danube,
                    invaded the borders of the empire, and obtained settlements in the province of
                    Moesia, where their lauguage was committed to writing in the 4th century; its
                    literary remains are of peculiar value as the oldest specimens, by several
                    centuries, of Teutonic speech. To the Low German division also belonged the
                    dialects of the invaders of Britain. As we have no specimens of the language of
                    these tribes for nearly three centuries after their settlement in this island,
                    we cannot tell to what extent they agreed with, and differed from, each other;
                    nor can we be sure whether the differences actually found at a later period,
                    when we have opportunity of comparison, between northern and southern English,
                    were due to original diversity, or to subsequent differentiation. However, as
                    the dialectal differences afterwards discernible corresponded in the main to the
                    areas historically assigned to Angles and Saxons respectively, it may be assumed
                    that there was some difference of dialect to begin with, that of the Saxons
                    being more closely allied to the Old Saxon of the Continent, of which Dutch is
                    probably the nearest living representative, and the Angle dialect having more
                    affinity with the Frisian, and through that with the Scandinavian. At the
                    present day the most English or Angli-form dialects of the Continent are those
                    of the North Frisian islands of Amrum and Sylt, on the west coast of Schleswig.
                    It is well known that the greater part of the ancient Friesland has been swept
                    away by the encroachments of the North Sea, and the <hi rend="italic">disjecta
                    membra</hi> of the Frisian race, pressed by the sea in front and encroaching
                    nationalities behind, are found only in isolated fragments from the Zuyder Zee
                    to the coasts of Denmark. Of the Ge&lt;itas, Eôtas, or “Jutes,” who, according
                    to Baeda, formed the third tribe along with the Angles aud Saxons, it is
                    difficult to speak linguistically. In the opinion of the present writer, the
                    speech of Kent has ever been a typically southern or “Saxon” one, and at the
                    present day its popular dialect is identical with that of Sussex, one of the old
                    Saxon kingdoms; that of the Isle of Wight differs in no respect from that of
                    Hampshire, nor does it show any special connection with that of Kent. Mr Henry
                    Sweet has, however, shown<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    early as the 8th cen tury differed from West-Saxon in one or two points of vowel
                    pronunciation, and that the distinction was maintained as late as the 14th;
                    though it cannot be said to have therein approached more closely to the northern
                    dialect, which ought to have been the case had Baeda’s “Geâtas” been
                    Jutlanders.</p>
                <p>As it was amongst the <hi rend="italic">Angel-cynn</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Engle</hi> of Northumbria that literary culture first flourished, and an Angle
                    or <hi rend="italic">Englisc</hi> dialect was the first to be used for
                    vernacular literature,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    25.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Englisc</hi> came eventually to be a general
                    name for all forms of the vernacular as opposed to Latin, &lt;tc.; and even when
                    the West-Saxon of Alfred became in its turn the literary or classical form of
                    speech, it was still called Englisc or <hi rend="italic">English.</hi> The
                    origin of the name Anglo-Saxon is disputed, some maintaining very positively
                    that it means a union of Angles and Saxons, others (with better foundation) that
                    it meant <hi rend="italic">English Saxons,</hi> or Saxons of England, as
                    distinguished from Saxons of the Continent Its modern use is mainly due to the
                    little baud of scholars who in the 16th and 17th centuries turned their
                    attention to the long forgotten language of Alfred and Aelfric. which, as it
                    differed so utterly from the English of their own day <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> they found it convenient to distinguish by a name which was applied to
                    themselves by those who spoke it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Aethelstan in 934 calls himself in a charter “Ongol-Saxna

                    cyning and casere totius·Britanniae,” and the name is of frequent occurrence in
                    Latin documents. These facts ought to be remembered in the interest of the
                    scholars of the l?th century, who have been blamed for the use of the term
                    Anglo-Saxon, as if they had invented it. By “Anglo-Saxon” language they meant
                    the language of the people who <hi rend="italic">sometimes at least</hi> called
                    themselves “Anglo-Saxons.” Even now the name is practically useful, when we are
                    dealing with the subject <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> as is <hi rend="italic"

                    ages.</p>
                <p>As already hinted, the English language, in the wide sense, presents three main
                    stages of development—Old, Middle, and Modern—distinguished by their inflexional
                    characteristics. The latter can be best summarized in the words of Mr Henry

                    Each of these periods may also be divided into two—an early and a late; but from
                    the want of materials this division may be waived in regard to the first. We
                    have thus the following divisions, with the approximate dates, which, however,
                    varied considerably for different dialects and parts of the country :—</p>

                <p>Transition period. But the division given above, which was, I believe, first
                    proposed by Mr Sweet, represents better the development of the language.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Old English,</hi> or Anglo-Saxon tongue, as introduced
                    into Britain, was highly inflexional, though its inflexions were not so full as
                    those of the older Moeso-Gothic, and considerably less so than those of Greek
                    and Latin during their classical periods. They corresponded on the whole to
                    those of modern literary German, though both in nouns and verbs the forms were
                    more distinct; for example, the German <hi rend="italic">guten</hi> answers to
                    <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Old English forms,— <hi rend="italic">godne,
                    godum,godan;</hi><hi rend="italic">guter</hi><hi rend="italic">to two</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">godre, gbdra;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >liebten</hi><hi rend="italic">to two,-lufodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >lufeden.</hi> Nouns had four cases, <hi rend="italic">Nominative,
                    Accusative</hi> (not always distinct), <hi rend="italic">Genitive, Dative,</hi>
                    the latter used also with prepositions to express locative, instrumental, and
                    most ablative relations; of a distinct instrumental case only vestiges occur.
                    There were several declensions of nouns, the main division being that known in
                    Teutonic languages generally as strong and weak,—a distinction also extending to
                    adjectives in such wise that every adjective assumed either inflexion as
                    determined by associated grammatical forms. The first and second personal
                    pronouns possessed a dual; the third person had a complete declension of the
                    stem <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> instead of being made up as now of the three
                    seen in <hi rend="italic">he, she, they.</hi> The verb distinguished the
                    subjunctive from the indicative mood, but had only two inflected tenses, present
                    and past,—the former also used for the future, the latter for all the shades of
                    past time. The order of the sentence corresponded generally to that of German.
                    Thus from King Alfred’s additions to his translation of Orosius :—Donne ]&gt;y
                    ylcan daege hi hine to paem ade heran wyllaÖ, j&gt;onne todaelaÔ hi his feoh.
                    J&gt;aet paer to lafe biδ aefter paem gedrynce and paem plegan. on fif oδ&lt;5e
                    syx. hwilum on ma. swa swa J&gt;aes feos andefn biδ. “Then the same day [that]
                    they him to the pile bear will, then divide they his property that there to
                    remainder is, after the drinking and the sports, into five or six, at times into
                    more, according as of the property the value is.”</p>
                <p>The poetry was distinguished by alliteration, and the abundant use of figurative
                    and metaphorical expressions, of bold compounds and archaic words never found in
                    prose. Thus in the following lines from Beowulf :—</p>

                <p>The street was stone-variegated, (it) pointed the path To (the) men together; the

                    horror-accoutrements to go came.”</p>
                <p>The Old English was a homogeneous language, having very few foreign elements in
                    it, and forming its compounds and derivatives entirely from its own resources. A
                    few Latin appellatives learned from the Romans in the German wars had been
                    adopted into the common Teutonic tongue, and are found in English as in the
                    allied dialects. Such were <hi rend="italic">straete,</hi> street <hi
                    rend="italic">(via strata), camp,</hi> battle, <hi rend="italic">casere,</hi>
                    Caesar, <hi rend="italic">mil,</hi> mile, <hi rend="italic">pin,</hi>
                    punishment; perhaps <hi rend="italic">cyrice,</hi> church, <hi rend="italic"

                    The relations of the first invaders to the Britons were to a great extent those
                    of destroyers; and with the exception of the proper names of places and
                    prominent natural features, which as is usual were retained by the new
                    population, few British words found their way into the Old English. Among these
                    are named <hi rend="italic">broc,</hi> a badger, <hi rend="italic">brec,</hi>
                    breeches, <hi rend="italic">clut,</hi> clout, <hi rend="italic">pul,</hi> pool,
                    and a few words relating to the employment of field or household menials. Still
                    fewer words seem to have been adopted from the provincial Latin, almost the only
                    certain one being <hi rend="italic">castra,</hi> applied to the Roman towns,
                    which appeared in English as <hi rend="italic">c&lt;xstre, ceaster,</hi> now
                    found in composition as <hi rend="italic">-caster,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-ehester,</hi><hi rend="italic">-cester.</hi> The introduction and gradual
                    adoption of Christianity, brought a new series of Latin words connected with the
                    offices of the church, the accompaniments of higher civilization, the foreign
                    productions either actually made known, or mentioned in the Scriptures and
                    devotional books. Such were <hi rend="italic">myηster</hi> (monasterium), <hi
                    rend="italic">aelmesse</hi> (eleemosyna), <hi rend="italic">candel</hi>
                    (candela), <hi rend="italic">turtle</hi> (turtur), <hi rend="italic">fie</hi>
                    (ficus), <hi rend="italic">cedar</hi> (cedrus). These words, whose number
                    increased from the 7th to the 10th century, are commonly called <hi
                    rend="italic">Latin of the second period,</hi> the Latin of the first period
                    including the Latin words brought by the English from Germany, as well as those
                    picked up in Britain either from the provincials or the Welsh, which have not
                    hitherto been separated from them. The Danish invasions of the 8th and 10th
                    centuries resulted in the establishment of extensive Danish and Norwegian
                    populations, about the basin of the Humber and its tributaries, and above
                    Morecambe Bay. Although these Scandinavian settlers must have greatly affected
                    the language of their own localities, few traces of their influence are to be
                    found in the literature of the Old English period. As with the greater part of
                    the words adopted from the Celtic, it was not until after the dominion of the
                    Norman had overlaid all preceding conquests, and the new English began to emerge
                    from the ruins of the old, that Danish words in any number made their appearance
                    in books, as equally native with the Anglo-Saxon.</p>
                <p>The earliest specimens we have of English date to the end of the 7th century, and
                    belong to the Anglian or northern dialect, which, under the political eminence
                    of the early Northumbrian kings from Edwin to Ecgfrift, aided perhaps by the
                    learning of the scholars of Iona, first attained to literary distinction. Of
                    this literature in its original form mere fragments exist, one of the most
                    interesting of which consists of the verses uttered by Baeda on his deathbed,
                    and preserved in a nearly contemporary MS.</p>
                <p>Fore there neid-faerae. naenig uuiurthit thonc-snotturra. than him tharf sie, to
                    ymb-hycggannae . aer his hin-iongae, huaet his gastae. godaes aeththa yflae⅜
                    aefter deoth-daege . doemid uueorthae.</p>
                <p>Before the inevitable journey no one becomes More thought-prudent than he has
                    need, To ponder, ere his hence-going, What, to his ghost, of good or of ill,
                    After death-day, deemed shall be.</p>
                <p>But our chief acquaintance with Old English is in its West-Saxon form, the
                    earliest literary remains of which date to the 9th century, when under the
                    political supremacy of Wessex and the scholarship of King Alfred it became the
                    literary language of the English nation, the classical “Anglo-Saxon.” If our
                    materials were more extensive, it would probably be necessary to divide the Old
                    English into several periods; as it is, Mr Sweet, who has laboured chiefly in
                    this field, has pointed out considerable differences between the “early
                    West-Saxon” of King Alfred and the later language of the 11th century,<note

                    northern dialect, whose literary career had been cut short in the 8th century by
                    the Danish invasions, reappears in the 10th in the form of glosses to the Latin
                    gospels and the Ritual of Durham, where we find that in the process of
                    inflexionlevelling it has, owing to the confusion which had so long reigned in
                    the north, advanced far beyond the sister dialect of the south, so as to be
                    already almost Transition English, or “Semi-Saxon.”</p>
                <p>Among the literary remains of the Old English may be mentioned the epic poem of
                    Beowulf, the original nucleus of which has been supposed to date to heathen and
                    even Continental times, though we now possess it only in a later form; several
                    works of Alfred, two of which, his translation of Orosius, and of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Pastoral Care</hi> of St Gregory, are contemporary specimens
                    of his language; the theological works of Aelfric (including translations of the
                    Pentateuch and the gospels) and of Wulfstân; the poetical works of Cynewulf:
                    those ascribed to Caedmon; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; and many works both in
                    prose and verse of which the authors are unknown.</p>
                <p>The earliest specimens, the inscriptions on the Ruthwell and Bewcastle crosses,
                    are in a Runic character; but the letters used in the manuscripts generally are
                    a British variety of the Roman alphabet which the Anglo-Saxons found in the
                    island, and which was also used by the Welsh and Irish.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See on this Rhys, <hi rend="italic">Lectures
                    on Welsh Philology,</hi> v.</p></note> Several of the letters had in Britain
                    developed forms, and retained or acquired values, unlike those used on the
                    Continent, in particular bfjpj∙c(dfgrst). The letters k q z were not used, q
                    being represented by cw; u or V was only a vowel, the consonantal power of v
                    being repre sented as in Welsh by f. The Runes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >thorn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wen,</hi> for which the Roman alphabet had no
                    character, were at first expressed by th, Ö (a contraction for bb or bh), and v
                    or u; but at a later period the characters ]&gt; and p were revived from the old
                    Runic alphabet. Contrary to Continental usage, the letters c and 5 (g) had only
                    their hard or guttural powers, as in the neighbouring Celtic languages; so that
                    words which, when the Continental Roman alphabet came to be used for Germanic
                    languages, had to be written with <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> were in Old English
                    written with <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">cimce = kirke.</hi>
                    The key to the values of the letters, and thus to the pronunciation of Old
                    English, is also to be found in the Celtic tongues whence the letters were
                    taken.</p>
                <p>The Old English period is usually considered as terminating about the year
                    1100,—that is, with the death of the generation who saw the Norman Conquest. The
                    Conquest established in England a foreign court, a foreign aristocracy, and a
                    foreign hierarchy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a

                    the language of a subject race, was left to the use of boors and serfs, and
                    except in a few stray cases ceased to be written at all<note anchored="true"

                    himself. Its social degradation seemed even on the point of coming to an end,
                    when it was confirmed and prolonged for two centuries more by tlve accession of
                    the Angevin dynasty, under whom everything French received a fresh

                    that saw the arrival of the Norman died out, the language, ceasing to be read
                    and written, lost all its literary words. The words of ordinary life whose
                    preservation is independent of books lived on as vigorously as ever, but the
                    literary terms, those that related to science, art, andhigher culture, the bold
                    artistic compounds, the figurative terms of poetry, were speedily forgotten. The
                    practical vocabulary shrank to a fraction of its former extent. And when,
                    generations later, English began to be used for general literature, the only
                    terms at hand to express ideas above those of every day life were to be found in
                    the French of the privileged classes, of whom alone art, science, law, and
                    theology had been for generations the inheritance. Hence each successive
                    literary effort of the reviving English tongue shows a larger adoption of French
                    words to supply the place of the forgotten native ones, till by the days of
                    Chaucer they constituted a formidable part of the vocabulary. Nor was it for the
                    time being only that the French words affected the English vocabulary. The
                    Norman French words introduced by the Conquest, as well as the Parisian French
                    words which followed under the early Plantagenets, were, the bulk of them, Latin
                    words which had lived on among the people of Gaul, and, modified in the mouths
                    of succeeding generations, had reached forms more or less remote from their
                    originals. In being now adopted as English, they supplied precedents in
                    accordance with which other Latin words without limit might be converted into
                    English ones, whenever required; and long before the Renaissance of classical
                    learning, though in much greater numbers after that epoch, these precedents were
                    eagerly followed.</p>
                <p>While the eventual though distant result of the Norman Conquest was thus a large
                    reconstruction of the English vocabulary, the grammar of the language was not
                    directly affected by it. There was no reason why it should,—we might almost add,
                    no way by which it could. While the English used their own <hi rend="italic"
                    >wards,</hi> they could not forget their own <hi rend="italic">way</hi> of using
                    them, the inflexions and constructions by which alone the words expressed
                    ideas,—in other words, their grammar; when one by one French words were
                    introduced into the sentence they became English by the very act of admission,
                    and were at once subjected to all the duties and liabilities of English words in
                    the same position. This is of course precisely what we do at the present day:
                    <hi rend="italic">telegraph</hi> and <hi rend="italic">telegram</hi> make
                    participle <hi rend="italic">telegraphing</hi> and plural <hi rend="italic"
                    >telegrams,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">“scrumptious,”</hi> adverb <hi
                    rend="italic">“scrump-tiously,”</hi> precisely as if they had been in the
                    language for ages.</p>
                <p>But indirectly the grammar was affected very quickly. In languages in the
                    inflected or synthetic stage the terminations must be pronounced with marked
                    distinctness, as these contain the correlation of ideas; it is all-important to
                    hear whether a word is <hi rend="italic">bonus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">boηas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bonos.</hi>
                    This implies a measured and careful pronunciation, against which the effort for
                    ease and rapidity of utterance is continually struggling, while indolence and
                    carelessness continually compromise it. There has been an increasing tendency in
                    English, as in other languages, to give each word one main accent, at or near
                    the beginning, and to suffer the concluding syllables to fall into obscurity, We
                    are familiar with the cockney <hi rend="italic">winder, sofer, holler, Surer,
                    Sunder,</hi> for windoiø, sofa, holla, SaraΛ, Sunday, the various final vowels
                    sinking into an obscure neutral one conventionally spelt <hi rend="italic"
                    >er.</hi> Already before the Conquest, forms originally <hi rend="italic">hatu,
                    sello, tuηga,</hi> appeared as <hi rend="italic">hate,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >selle,</hi><hi rend="italic">tunge,</hi> with the terminations levelled to
                    obscure <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> but during the illiterate period of the
                    language after the Conquest, this careless obscuring of terminal vowels became
                    universal, all unaccented vowels in the final syllable (except <hi rend="italic"
                    >i)</hi> sinking into <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> During the 12th century, while
                    this change was going on, we find a great confusion of grammatical forms, the
                    full inflexions of Old English standing side by side in the same sentence with
                    the levelled ones of Middle English. It is to this state of the language that
                    the names <hi rend="italic">Transition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Period
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">onfusion</hi> (Dr Abbott’s
                    appellation) point; its appearance, as that of Anglo-Saxon broken down in its
                    endings, had previously given to it the suggestive if not strictly logical title
                    of Semi-Saxon. By most writers the <pb break="no"

                    1250; but very shortly after 1200 in the south, and considerably before it in
                    the north, the levelling of inflexions was complete, and the language possessed
                    of a tolerably settled system of new grammatical forms, the use of which marks
                    Middle English.</p>
                <p>Although the written remains of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Transition Old
                    English</hi> are few, sufficient exist to enable us to trace the course of
                    linguistic change. Within two generations after the Conquest, faithful pens were
                    at work transliterating the old homilies of Aelfric, and other lights of the
                    Anglo-Saxon Church, into the neglected idiom of their posterity. Twice during
                    the period, in the reigus of Stephen and Henry IL, Aelfric’s gospels were
                    similarly modernized so as to be “understated of the people.” And shortly after
                    1100 appeared the great work of the age, the versified <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> of Layamon, or Lawëman, a priest of Ernely, on the Severn, who,
                    using as his basis the French <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi> of Wace, expanded it
                    by additions of his own to more than twice the extent; his work of 32,250 lines
                    is a mine of illustration for the language of the period. While these southern
                    remains carry on in unbroken sequence the history of the Old English of Alfred
                    and Aelfric, the history of the northern English is an entire blank from the
                    11th to the 13th century. The stubborn resistance of the north, and the terrible
                    retaliation inflicted by William, apparently effaced northern English culture
                    for centuries. If anything was written in the vernacular in the kingdom of
                    Scotland during the same period, it probably perished during the calamities to
                    which that country was subjected during the half century of struggle for
                    independence. In reality, however, the northern English had entered its
                    Transition or “Semi-Saxon” stage two centuries earlier; the glosses of the 10th
                    century show that the Danish inroads had there anticipated the results hastened
                    by the Norman Conquest in the south. Meanwhile a dialect was making its
                    appearance in another quarter of England, destined to overshadow the old
                    literary dialects of north and south alike, and become the English of the
                    future. The Mercian kingdom, which, a3 its name imports, lay along the <hi
                    rend="italic">marches</hi> of the earlier states, and was really a congeries of
                    the outlying members of many tribes, must have presented from the beginning a
                    linguistic mixture and transition; and it is probable that more than one
                    intermediate form of speech arose within its confines, between Lancashire and
                    the Thames. But the only specimen of such we can with some degree of certainty
                    produce comes towards the close of the Old English period, in the gloss to the
                    Rushworth Gospels, which, so far as concerns St Matthew, and a fewverses of St
                    John xviιL, is probably in a Mercian dialect. At least it presents a phase of
                    the language which in inflexional decay stands about midway between the
                    West-Saxon and the Northumbrian glosses, to which it is yet posterior in time.
                    But soon after the Conquest we find an undoubted midland dialect in the
                    Transition stage from Old to Middle English, in the south-eastern part of
                    ancient Mercia, in a district bounded on the south and south-east by the Saxon
                    Middlesex and Essex, and on the east and north by the East Anglian Norfolk and
                    Suffolk and the Danish settlements on the Trent and Humber. In this -district,
                    and in the monastery of Peterborough, one of the copies of the Old English
                    Chronicle, transcribed about 1120, was written up by two succeeding hands to the
                    death of Stephen in 1154. The section from 1122 to 1131, written in the latter
                    year, shows the same confusion as in Layamon between Old English forms and those
                    of a still simpler Middle English, impatient to rid itself of the inflexional
                    trammels which were still, though in weakened forms, so tightly hugged south of
                    the Thames. And in the concluding section written in 1154 we find Middle English
                    fairly started on its career. A specimen of this new tongue will best show the
                    change that had taken place.</p>

                    which claimed auy pre-eminence over the others The writers of each district
                    wrote in the dialect familiar to them; and between extreme forms the difference
                    was so great as to amount to unintelligibility; works written for southern

                    midland dialect, unknown to Old English, has been a matter of conjecture; most
                    probably it is an instance of <hi rend="italic">form-levelling,</hi> the
                    inflexion of the present indicative being assimilated to that of the past, and
                    the present and past subjunctive, in all of which <hi rend="italic">-en</hi> was
                    the plural termination. In the declension of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns,
                    the northern dialect had attained before the end of the 13th century to the
                    simplicity of Modern English, while the southern dialect still retained a large
                    number of inflexions, and the midland a considerable number. The dialects
                    differed also in phonology, for while the northern generally retained the hard
                    or guttural values of <hi rend="italic">k, g, sc,</hi> these were in the two
                    other dialects palatalized before front vowels into <hi rend="italic">ch,
                    j,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sh. Kyrle, chirche</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >church; bryg, bridge; sο∙yke, shriek,</hi> are examples. The original <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">stdn, mdr,</hi> preserved in the
                    northern <hi rend="italic">staηe, mare,</hi> became 0 elsewhere, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">stone, more.</hi> So that the north presented the general aspect
                    of conservation of old sounds with the most thorough-going dissolution of old
                    inflexions; the south, a tenacious retention of the inflexions, with an
                    extensive revolution in the sounds. In one important respect, however, phonetic
                    decay was far ahead in the north: the final <hi rend="italic">e</hi> to which
                    all the old vowels had been levelled during the Transition period, and which is
                    a distinguishing feature of Middle English in the midland and southern dialects,
                    became mute, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> disappeared, in the northern dialect
                    before the latter emerged from its three centuries of obscuration, shortly
                    before 1300." So thoroughly modern did its form consequently become that we
                    might almost call it Modern English, and say that the Middle English stage of
                    the northern dialect is lost. For comparison with the other dialects, however,
                    the same nomenclature may be used, and we may class as Middle English the
                    extensive literature which northern England produced during the 14th century.
                    The earliest specimen is probably the Metrical Psalter in the Cotton

                    alliterative romances in this dialect cannot be determined with exactness, as
                    all survive in later copies, but it is probable that many of them are not later
                    than 1300. In the 14th century appeared the theological and devotional works of
                    Richard Rolle the anchorite of</p>
                <p>Hampole, Dan Jon Gaytrigg, William of Nassington, and other writers whose names
                    are unknown; and towards the close of the century, specimens of the language
                    also appear from Scotland both in public documents and the poetical works of
                    John Barbour, whose language, barring minute points of orthography, is identical
                    with that of the contemporary northern English writers.</p>
                <p>In the southern dialect, the work of Layamon was succeeded at an interval
                    estimated at from 15 to 25 years by the <hi rend="italic">Ancren lliιcle</hi> or
                    “Rule of Nuns,” written for a small sisterhood at Tarrant-Kaines, in
                    Dorsetshire, in which we find the Middle English stage fully developed, and also
                    recognize a dialectal characteristic which had probably long prevailed in the
                    south, though concealed by the spelling, in the use of <hi rend="italic">ν</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">valle,</hi> fall, <hi

                    later do we find a recognition of the parallel use of 2 for s. Among the
                    writings which succeed, <hi rend="italic">The Owl and the Nightingale</hi> of
                    Nicholas de Guildford, of Portesham in Dorsetshire, about 1250, the <hi

                    translation of Higden, 1387, are of chief importance in illustrating the history
                    of southern English. The earliest form of Langland’s <hi rend="italic">Piers
                    Ploughman,</hi> 13G2, as preserved in the Vernon MS., appears to be in an

                <p>In its use of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> (w) and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and s, and its grammatical inflexions, it presents an
                    extreme type of southern speech, with vowel peculiarities specially Kentish; and
                    in comparison with contemporary midland English works, it looks like a fossil of
                    two centuries earlier.</p>
                <p>Turning from the dialectal extremes of the Middle English to the midland speech,
                    which we left at the closing leaves of the Peterborough <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> of 1154, we find a rapid development of this dialect, which was
                    before long to become the national literary language. As was natural in a tract
                    of country which stretched from Lancaster to Essex, a very considerable variety
                    is found in the documents which agree in presenting the leading midland
                    features, those of Lancashire and Lincolnshire approaching the northern dialect
                    both in vocabulary, phonetic character, and greater neglect of inflexions. But
                    this diversity diminishes as we advance. The first great work is the <hi
                    rend="italic">0rmulum,</hi> or metrical Scripture paraphase of 0rm or 0rmin,
                    written about 1200, it is generally assumed, in Lincolnshire or Notts, though
                    there is much to be said fcr the neighbourhood of Ormskirk in Lancashire. Anyhow
                    the dialect has a decided smack of the north, and shows for the first time in
                    English literature a large percentage of Scandinavian words, derived from the
                    Danish settlers, who, iu adopting English, had preserved a vast number of their
                    ancestral forms of speech, which were in time to pass into the common language,
                    of which they now constitute some of the most familiar words. <hi rend="italic"

                    as the only public recognition of the native tongue between William the

                <p>As to the dialect of this document, it is more southern than anything else, with
                    a slight midland admixture, and represents no doubt the London speech of the
                    day. London being in a Saxon county, and contiguous to the Saxon Kent and
                    Surrey, had certainly at first a southern dialect; but its position as the
                    capital, as well as its proximity to the midland district, made its dialect more
                    and more midland. Even in Chaucer, however, it has still southern features, for
                    Chaucer’s language is well known to be more southern than standard English
                    eventually became. Inflexionally, the proclamation is much more archaic than the
                    <hi rend="italic">Genesis and Exodus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ormulum;</hi> but
                    it closely resembles the old Kentish Sermons and <hi rend="italic">Proverbs of
                    Alfred</hi> in the southern dialect of 1250.</p>
                <p>In the writings of the second half of this century, the language becomes rapidly
                    more modern in aspect, till we arrive about 1300 at the name of Robert of Brunne
                    in south Lincolnshire, with whom we pass from the Early to the Later Middle
                    English. Different tests and different dates have indeed been proposed for
                    subdividing the Middle English, but the most important is that of Mr Henry
                    Nicol, based on the discovery that in the 13th century, as in 0rmin, the Old
                    English short vowels in an open syllable still retained their short quantity, as
                    <hi rend="italic">ηama, over, mete;</hi> but by the beginning of the 14th
                    century they were lengthened to <hi rend="italic">na-me, o-ver, me-te,</hi> a
                    change which has also taken place at a particular period in all the Teutonic,
                    and even the Romance languages, as in <hi rend="italic">buo-no</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">bo-num, ca-ηe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">cd-nem,</hi> &amp;c. The
                    lengthening of the penult left the final syllable by contrast shortened or
                    weakened, and paved the way for the disappearance of final <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> in the century following, through the stages <hi rend="italic">na-me,
                    ηa-me, na-m</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">, ηam,</hi> the one long syllable in <hi
                    rend="italic">nam(f)</hi> being the quantitative equivalent of the two short
                    syllables in <hi rend="italic">ηa-me</hi>; and thus came the idea that mute <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> makes a preceding vowel long, the truth being that the
                    lengthening of the vowel made the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> mute. The late Middle
                    English produced the prose of Mandeville and Wycliffe, and the poetry of
                    Chaucer, with whom it may be said to have culminated, and in whose writingsits
                    main characteristics as distinct from Old and Modern English may be studied.
                    Thus, we find final <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in full use representing numerous
                    original vowels and terminations as</p>
                <p>Him thoughts that his hertè woldè brekè, in Old English—</p>
                <p>Him puhte paet his heorte wolde brecan, which may be compared with the modern
                    German—</p>

                <p>In nouns the <hi rend="italic">-es</hi> of the plural and genitive case is still
                    syllabic—</p>
                <p>Reede as the berstl-es of a sow-es eer-es.</p>
                <p>Several old genitives and plural forms continued to exist, and the dative or
                    prepositional case often has a final <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Adjectives retain
                    so much of the old declension as to have -ö in the definite form and in the
                    plural—</p>
                <p>The tend-re cropp-es and the yong-e sonne.</p>
                <p>And smal-e fowl-es maken melodie.</p>
                <p>Numerous old forms of comparison were in use, which have not come down to Modern
                    English, as <hi rend="italic">lierre, ferre,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lenger,</hi><hi rend="italic">hext</hi> = higher, farther, longer, highest. In
                    the pronouns, <hi rend="italic">ich</hi> lingered alongside of <hi rend="italic"
                    >I; ye</hi> was only nominative, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> objective; the
                    northern <hi rend="italic">thei</hi> had dispossessed the southern <hi
                    rend="italic">hy,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">her</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >hem</hi> (the modern <hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >em)</hi> stood their ground against <hi rend="italic">their</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">them.</hi> The verb is <hi rend="italic">I lov-e, thou

                    plural <hi rend="italic">loυ-en</hi> is interchanged with <hi rend="italic"
                    >↑σv-e,</hi> as rhyme or euphony requires. So in the plural of the past <hi
                    rend="italic">we love-den</hi> or <hi rend="italic">love-de.</hi> The infinitive
                    also ends in <hi rend="italic">en,</hi> often <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> always
                    syllabic. The present participle, in Old English <hi rend="italic">-ende,</hi>
                    passing through <hi rend="italic">-inde,</hi> has been confounded with the
                    verbal noun in <hi rend="italic">-ynge, -yng,</hi> as in Modern English. The
                    past participle largely retains the prefix <hi rend="italic">y-</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">i-,</hi> representing the Old English <hi rend="italic">ge-,</hi>
                    as in <hi rend="italic">i-ronηe, y-dοn,</hi> run, done. Many old verb forms
                    still continued in existence. The adoption of French words, not only those of
                    Norman introduction, but those subsequently introduced under the Angevin kings,
                    to supply obsolete and obsolescent English ones, which had kept pace with the
                    growth of literature since the beginning of the Middle English period, had now
                    reached its climax; later times added many more, but they also dropped many that
                    were in regular use with Chaucer and his contemporaries.</p>
                <p>Chaucer’s great contemporary, William Langland, in his <hi rend="italic">Vision
                    of William concerning Piers the Ploughman,</hi> and his imitator the author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pierce the Ploughman’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Crede</hi> (about
                    1400) used the Old English alliterative versification for the last time in the
                    south. Rhyme had made its appearance in the language shortly after the
                    Conquest—if not already known before; and in the south and midlands it became
                    decidedly more popular than alliteration; the latter retained its hold much
                    longer in the north, where it was written even after 1500: many of the northern
                    romances are either simply alliterative, or have both alliteration and rhyme. To
                    these characteristics of northern and southern verse respectively Chaucer
                    alludes in the prologue of the “Persone,” who, when called upon for his tale,
                    said—</p>
                <p>“But trusteth wel; I am a sotherne man, I cannot geste <hi rend="italic"
                    >rom,</hi><hi rend="italic">ram,</hi><hi rend="italic">ruf,</hi> by my letter,
                    And, God wote, rime hold I but litel better: And therfore, if you list, I wol
                    not glose, I wol you tell a litel tale in prose.”</p>
                <p>The changes from Old to Middle English may be summed up thus :—Loss of a large
                    part of the native vocabulary, and adoption of French words to supply the blank;
                    not infrequent adoption of French words as synonyms of existing native ones;
                    modernization of the English words preserved, by vowel change in a definite
                    direction from back to front, and from open to close, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    becoming <hi rend="italic">o, o</hi> tending to <hi rend="italic">oo, τι</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">ou,</hi><hi rend="italic">ea</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ee, ee</hi> to Σ, and by
                    advance of consonants from guttural to palatal; obscuration of vowels after the
                    accent, and especially of final <hi rend="italic">a, o, u</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">e;</hi> consequent confusion and loss of old inflexions, and their
                    replacement by prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and rules of position; abandonment
                    of alliteration for rhyme; and great development of dialects, in consequence of
                    there being no standard or recognized type of English.</p>
                <p>But the recognition came at length. By the reign of Edward III., French was so
                    little known in England, even in the families of the great, that about 1350
                    “John Cornwal, a maystere of gramere, chaungede pe lore in gramere scole <hi

                    the place of French in the pleadings in courts of law. Every reason conspired
                    that this “English” should be the midland dialect. It was the intermediate
                    dialect, intelligible, as Trevisa has told us, to both extremes, even when these
                    failed to be intelligible to each other; in its south-eastern form, it was the
                    language of London, where the supreme law courts were, the centre of political
                    and commercial life; it was the language in which the Wycliffite versions had
                    given the Holy Scriptures to the people; the language in which Chaucer had
                    raised English poetry to a height of excellence admired and imitated by
                    contemporaries and followers. And accordingly after the end of the 14th century,
                    all Englishmen who thought they had anything to say worth listening to said it
                    in the midland speech Trevisa’s own work was almost the last literary effort of
                    the southern dialect; henceforth it was but a rustic patois, which the dramatist
                    might use to give local colouring to his creations, as Shakespeare uses it to
                    complete Edgar’s peasant disguise in <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> or which 19 th
                    century research might disinter to illustrate obscure chapters in the history of
                    language. And though the northern English proved a little more stubborn, it
                    disappeared also from literature in England; but in Scotland, which had now
                    become politically and socially estranged from England, it continued its course
                    as the national language of the country, attaining in the 15th and 16th
                    centuries a distinct development and high literary culture, for the details of

                <p>The 15th century of English history, with its bloody French war abroad, and Wars
                    of the Roses at home, was a barren period in literature, and a transition one in
                    language, witnessing the decay and disappearance of the final <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and most of the syllabic inflexions of Middle English. Already by 1420,
                    in Chaucer’s disciple Hoccleve, final <hi rend="italic">e</hi> was quite
                    uncertain; in Lydgate it was practically gone. In 1450 the writings of Pecocke
                    against the Wycliffites show the verbal inflexions in <hi rend="italic">-en</hi>
                    in a state of obsolescence; he has still the southern pronouns <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The change of the language during the second period of Transition, as well as the
                    extent of dialectal differences, is quaintly expressed a generation later by
                    Caxton, who in the prologue to one of the last of his works, his translation of
                    Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Enegdos</hi> (1490), speaks of the difficulty he had
                    in pleasing all readers :—</p>
                <p>“I doubted that it sholde not please some gentylmen, whiche late blamed me,

                    from that whiche was vsed and spoken λvhan I was borne. For we englysshemen ben

                    much that in my days happened that certayn marchauntes were in a shipe in

                    thei taryed atte forlond, and wente to lande for to refreshe them. And one of

                    sayd that he wolde haue eyren; then the good wyf sayd that she vnderstod hym

                <p>In the productions of Caxton’s press, we see the passage from Middle to Modern
                    English completed. The earlier of these have still an occasional verbal plural
                    in <hi rend="italic">-n,</hi> especially in the word <hi rend="italic">they
                    ben;</hi> the southern <hi rend="italic">her</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hem</hi>
                    of Middle English vary with the northern and Modern English <hi rend="italic"
                    >their, them.</hi> In the late works, the older forms have been practically
                    ousted, and the year 1485, which witnessed the establishment of the Tudor
                    dynasty, may be conveniently put as that which closed the Middle English
                    transition, and introduced Modern English. Both in the completion of this
                    result, and in its comparative permanence, the printing press had an important
                    share. By its exclusive patronage of the midland speech, it raised it still
                    higher above the sister dialects, and secured its abiding victory. As books were
                    multiplied and found their way into every corner of the land, and the art of
                    reading became a more common acquirement, the man of Northumberland or of
                    Somersetshire had forced upon his attention the b00k-Engli3h in which alone
                    these were printed. This became in turn the model for his own writings, and by
                    and by, if he made any pretensions to education, of his own speech. The written
                    <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the language also tended to uniformity. In
                    previous periods the scribe made his own spelling with a primary aim at
                    expressing his own speech, according to the particular values attached by
                    himself or his contemporaries to the letters and combinations of the alphabet,
                    though liable to disturbance in the most common words and combinations by his
                    ocular recollections of the spelling of others. But after the introduction of
                    printing, this ocular recognition of words became ever more and more an aim; the
                    book addressed the mind directly through the eye, instead of circuitously
                    through eye and ear; and thu3 there was a continuous tendency for written words
                    and parts of words to be reduced to a single form, and that the most usual, or
                    through some accident the best known, but not necessarily that which would have
                    been chosen had the <hi rend="italic">ear</hi> been called in as umpire. Modern
                    English spelling, with its rigid uniformity as to individual results and
                    whimsical caprice as to principles, is the creation of the printing-office, the
                    victory which, after a Century and a half of struggle, mechanical convenience
                    won over natural habits. Besides eventually creating a uniformity in writing,
                    the introduction of printing made or at least ratified some important changes.
                    The British and Old English form of the Roman alphabet has already been referred
                    to. This at the Norman Conquest was superseded by an alphabet with the French
                    forms and values of the letters. Thus <hi rend="italic">k</hi> took the place of
                    the older c before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i; qu</hi>
                    replaced cw; the Norman <hi rend="italic">w</hi> took the place of the <hi
                    rend="italic">wen (p), Ac.</hi> But there were certain sounds in English for
                    which Norman writing had no provision; and for these, in writing English, the
                    native characters were retained. Thus the Old English g (5), beside the sound in
                    <hi rend="italic">go,</hi> had a guttural sound as in German tay, Irish mayΛ,
                    and in certain positions a palatalized form of this approaching <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> as in you (if pronounced with aspiration Λyou or yλyou).
                    These sounds continued to be written with the native form of the letter as <hi
                    rend="italic">bury pur,</hi> while the French form was used for the sounds in
                    <hi rend="italic">go, age,—</hi> one original letter being thus split into two.
                    So for the sounds of <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> especially the sound in iΛat,
                    the Old English <hi rend="italic">thorn</hi> (p) continued to be used. But as
                    these characters were not used for French and Latin, their use even in English
                    became disturbed towards the 15th century, and when printing was introduced, the
                    founts, cast for Continental languages, had no characters for them, so that they
                    disappeared entirely, being replaced, <hi rend="italic">j</hi> by <hi
                    rend="italic">gh, yh, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> by <hi rend="italic"
                    >th.</hi> This was a real loss to the English alphabet. In the north it is
                    curious that the printers tried to express the <hi rend="italic">forms</hi>
                    rather than the powers of these letters, and consequently 3 was represented by
                    <hi rend="italic">2,</hi> the black letter form of which was confounded with it,
                    while the p was expressed by y, which its MS. form had come to approach or in
                    some cases simulate. So in early Scotch books we find <hi rend="italic">zellow,
                    ze, yat, yem, — yellow, ye, that, them.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Modern
                    English</hi> thus dates from Caxton. The language had at length reached the all
                    but inflexionless state which it now presents. A single older verbal form, the
                    southern <hi rend="italic">-eth</hi> of the third person singular, continued to
                    be the literary prose form throughout the 16th century, but the northern form in
                    -s was intermixed with it in poetry (where it saved a syllable), and must ere
                    long, as we see from Shakespeare, have taken its place in familiar speech. The
                    fuller <hi rend="italic">an, none, mine, thine.,</hi> in the early part of the
                    16th century at least, were used in positions where their contracted form3 <hi
                    rend="italic">a, no, my, thy</hi> are now found. But with such minute
                    exceptions, the accidence of the 16th century was the accidence of the 19th.
                    While, however, the older inflexions had disappeared, there was as yet no
                    general agreement as to the mode of their replacement. Hence the 16th century
                    shows a syntactic licence and freedom which distinguishes it strikingly from
                    that of later times. The language seems to be in a plastic, unformed state, and
                    its writers, as it were, experiment with it, bending it to constructione which
                    now seem indefensible. Old distinctions of case and mood have disappeared from
                    noun and verb, without fashion having yet decided what prepositions or auxiliary
                    verbs shall most fittingly convey their meaning. The laxity of word-order which
                    was permitted in older states of the language by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >formal</hi> expression of relations was often continued though the inflexions
                    which expressed the relations had disappeared. Partial analogy was followed in
                    allowing forms to be identified in one case, because, in another, such
                    identification was accidentally produced, as for instance the past participles
                    of <hi rend="italic">write</hi> and <hi rend="italic">take</hi> were made <hi
                    rend="italic">wrote</hi> and <hi rend="italic">took,</hi> because the contracted
                    participles of <hi rend="italic">bind</hi> and <hi rend="italic">break</hi> were
                    <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> and <hi rend="italic">broke.</hi> Finally, because,
                    in dropping inflexions, the former distinctions even between parts of speech had
                    disappeared, so that <hi rend="italic">iron, e.g.,</hi> was at once noun,
                    adjective.</p>

                    as if any word whatever might be used in any grammatical relation, where it
                    conveyed the idea of the speaker. Thus, as has been pointed out by Dr Abbott,
                    “you can <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> your friend, <hi rend="italic">malice</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> your enemy, or <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> an axe

                    <hi rend="italic">she</hi> he has yet beheld.’ An adverb can be used as a verb,
                    as ‘ they <hi rend="italic">askance</hi> their eyes; ’ as a noun, ‘ the <hi
                    rend="italic">backward</hi> and abyss of time;’ or as an adjective, a ‘ <hi

                    preferred to grammatical correctness, and brevity both to correctness and
                    clearness. Hence it was common to place words in the order in which they came
                    uppermost in the mind without much regard to syntax, and the result was a
                    forcible and perfectly unambiguous but ungrammatical sentence, such as</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Ben Jonson."</hi></p>
                <p>These characteristics, together with the presence of words now obsolete or
                    archaic, and the use of existing words in senses different from our own, as
                    general for specific, literal for metaphorical, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa,</hi> which are so apparent to every reader of the 16th century
                    literature, make it useful to separate <hi rend="italic">Early Modern</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Tudor</hi> English from the subsequent and still existing
                    stage, since the consensus of usage has declared in favour of individual senses
                    and constructions which are alone admissible in ordinary language.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the Tudor period was contemporaneous with the Renaissance in
                    art and literature, and the dawn of modem discoveries in geography and science.
                    The revival of the study of the classical writers of Greece and Rome, and the
                    translation of their works into the vernacular, led to the introduction of an
                    immense number of new words derived from these languages, either to express new
                    ideas and objects, or to indicate new distinctions in or groupings of old ideas.
                    Often also it seemed as if scholars were so pervaded with the form as well as
                    the spirit of the old, that it came more natural to them to express themselves
                    in words borrowed from the old than in their native tongue, and thus words of
                    Latin origin were introduced even when English already possessed perfectly good
                    equivalents. As lias already been stated, the French words of Norman and Angevin
                    introduction, being principally Latin words in an altered form, when used as
                    English supplied models whereby other Latin words could be converted into
                    English ones, and it is after these models that the Latin words introduced
                    during and since the 1βth century have been fashioned. There is nothing in the
                    <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the words <hi rend="italic">procession</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">progression</hi> to show that the one was used in England in
                    the 11th, the other not till the 16th century. Moreover, as the formation of new
                    words from Latin has gone on in French as well as in English since the
                    Renaissance, we cannot tell whether such words, <hi rend="italic">e.g ,</hi> as
                    <hi rend="italic">persuade</hi> and <hi rend="italic">persuasion,</hi> were
                    borrowed from their French equivalents or formed in England independently. With
                    some words indeed it is impossible to say whether they were formed in England
                    directly from Latin, borrowed from contemporary late French, or had been in
                    England since the Norman period; even <hi rend="italic">photograph,
                    geology,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">telephone</hi> have the form that they would
                    have had if thev had been living words in the mouths of Greeks, Latins, French,
                    and English from the beginning, instead of formations of the 19th century.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Evangelist,
                    astronomy, dialogue,</hi> are words that have so lived, of which their form is
                    the result. <hi rend="italic">Photograph,</hi> &amp;c., take this form <hi
                    rend="italic">as if</hi> they had the same history.</p></note> While every
                    writer was thus introducing new words according to his idea of their being
                    needed, it naturally happened that a large number were not accepted by
                    contemporaries or posterity; a porteutous list might be formed of these mintages
                    of the 16th and 17th centuries, which either never became current coin, or
                    circulated only as it were for a moment.</p>
                <p>The voyages of English navigators in the latter part of the 16th century also
                    introduced a considerable number of Spanish words, and American words in Spanish
                    forms, of which <hi rend="italic">potato, tobacco, cargo, armadillo, alligator,
                    galleon</hi> may serve as examples.</p>
                <p>The date of 1611, which coincides with the end of Shakespeare’s literary work and
                    the appearance of the Authorized Version of the Bible (a compilation from the
                    various 16th century versions), may be taken as marking the close of Tudor
                    English. The language was thenceforth Modern in structure, style, and
                    expression, although the spelling did not settle down to present usage till
                    about the Restoration. The distinctive features of Modern English have already
                    been anticipated by way of contrast with preceding stages of the language. It is
                    only necessary to-refer to the fact that the vocabulary is now much more
                    composite than at any previous period. The immense development of the physical
                    sciences has called for a corresponding extension of terminology which has been
                    supplied from Latin and especially Greek; and although these terms are in the
                    first instance <hi rend="italic">technical,</hi> yet with the spread of
                    education and general diffusion of the rudiments and appliances of science, the
                    boundary line between <hi rend="italic">technical</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >general,</hi> indefinite at the best, tends more and more to melt away, in
                    addition to the fact that words still technical become general in figurative or
                    metonymic senses. AcΛe, <hi rend="italic">diamond, stomach, comet, organ, tone,
                    ball, carte,</hi> are none the less familiar because once technical words.
                    Commercial, social, artistic, or literary contact has also led to the adoption
                    of numerous words from modern European languages, especially French, Italian,
                    Portuguese, Dutch (these two at a less recent period): thus from French <hi
                    rend="italic">soirée, séance,</hi><hi rend="italic">depot, debris, programme,
                    prestige;</hi> from Italian <hi rend="italic">bust, cartoon, concert, regatta,
                    ruffian;</hi> from Portuguese <hi rend="italic">caste, palaver;</hi> from Dutch
                    <hi rend="italic">yacht, skipper, schooner, sloop.</hi> Commercial intercourse
                    and colonization have extended far beyond Europe, and given us words more or
                    fewer from Hindu, Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Malay, Chinese, and from American,
                    Australian, Polynesian, and African languages.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See extended lists of the foreign words in
                    English in Dr Morris's <hi rend="italic">Historical Outlines of English
                    Accidence,</hi> p. 33.</p></note> More important even than these perhaps are the
                    dialectal words that from time to time obtain literary recognition, restoring to
                    us obsolete Old English forms, and not seldom words of Celtic or Danish origin,
                    which have been preserved in local dialects, and thus at length find their way
                    into the standard language. As to the actual proportion of the various elements,
                    it is probable that original English words do not now form more than a third or
                    perhaps a fourth of the total entries in a full English dictionary; and it might
                    seem strange, therefore, that we still identify the language with that of the
                    9th century, and class it as a member of the <hi rend="italic">Low German</hi>
                    division. But this explains itself, when we consider that of the total words in
                    a dictionary only a small portion are used by any one individual in speaking or
                    even in writing; that this portion includes <hi rend="italic">all</hi> or nearly
                    all the Anglo-Saxon words, and but a small fraction of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0419-0400"/> the others. The latter are in fact almost all <hi
                    rend="italic">names,—</hi> the vast majority names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >things</hi> (nouns), a smaller number names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >attributes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">actions</hi> (adjectives and verbs), and,
                    from their very nature, names of the things, attributes, and actions which come
                    less usually or very rarely under our notice. Thus in an ordinary book, a novel
                    or story, the foreign elements will amount to from 10 to 15 per cent, of the
                    whole; as the subject becomes more recondite or technical their number will
                    increase; till in a work on chemistry or abstruse mathematics the proportion may
                    be 40 per cent. But after all, it is not the question whence words <hi
                    rend="italic">may</hi> have been taken, but <hi rend="italic">how they are
                    used</hi> in a language that settles its character. If new words when adopted
                    conform themselves to the manner and usage of the adopting language, it makes
                    absolutely no difference whether they are transferred from some other language,
                    or invented off at the ground. In either case they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >new</hi> words to begin with; in either case also, if they are needed, they
                    will become as thoroughly native, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> familiar from
                    childhood to those who use them, as those that possess the longest native
                    pedigree. In this respect English is still strictly the same language it was in
                    the days of Alfred; and comparing its history with that of other Low German
                    dialects, there is no reason to believe that its grammar or structure would have
                    been different, however different its vocabulary might have been, if the Norman
                    Conquest had never taken place.</p>
                <p>The preceding sketch has had reference mainly to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >inflexional</hi> changes which the language has undergone; distinct from,
                    though intimately connected with these (as where the confusion or loss of
                    inflexions was a consequence of the weakening of final sounds) are the great
                    phonetic changes which have taken place between the 8th and 19th centuries, and
                    which result in making modern English words very different from their
                    Anglo-Saxon originals, even where no element has been lost, as in words like <hi

                    the broad facts, which are the following. (1) In an accented closed syllable,
                    original short vowels have remained nearly unchanged; thus the words <hi
                    rend="italic">at, men, bill, God, dust,</hi> are pronounced now nearly as in O.
                    E., though the last two were more like the Scotch <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and
                    North English <hi rend="italic">u</hi> respectively, and in most words the short
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> had a broader sound like the provincial <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">mam</hi> (2) Long accented vowels and
                    diphthongs have undergone a regular <hi rend="italic">laut-verschiebung</hi> or
                    shift towards higher and more advanced positions, so that the words <hi
                    rend="italic">ban,</hi><hi rend="italic">hoer,</hi><hi rend="italic">soece</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">sece, stol (i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic">bahn</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bawn, her, sole</hi> and <hi rend="italic">saik, stole)</hi> are
                    now <hi rend="italic">bone, hair, seek, stool;</hi> while the two high vowels
                    <hi rend="italic">ύ</hi> ( = oo) and <hi rend="italic">i (ee)</hi> have become
                    diphthongs, as <hi rend="italic">has, scir,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">house,
                    shire,</hi> though the old sound of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> remains in the
                    north <hi rend="italic">(hoose),</hi> and the original <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    in the pronunciation <hi rend="italic">sheer,</hi> approved by Walker, “as in
                    machine, and shire, and magazine.” (3) Short vowels in an open syllable have
                    usually been lengthened, as in <hi rend="italic">nd-ma, cbfa,</hi> now <hi
                    rend="italic">name, cove;</hi> but to this there are many exceptions. (4) Vowels
                    in terminal unaccented syllables have all sunk into short obscure <hi
                    rend="italic">è,</hi> and then, if final, disappeared; so <hi rend="italic">oxa,
                    seo, wudu,</hi> became <hi rend="italic">ox-e, se-e, wood-e,</hi> and then <hi
                    rend="italic">ox, see, wood; oxan, lufod,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">oxen,
                    loved, lov'd; writan, writon,</hi> later <hi rend="italic">writ-en, writ-e,</hi>
                    now <hi rend="italic">write, i.e., writ.</hi> (5) The back con sonants, <hi
                    rend="italic">c, g, sc,</hi> in connection with front vowels, have often become
                    palatalized to <hi rend="smallcaps">cä,</hi><hi rend="italic">j, sh,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">circe,</hi><hi rend="italic">rycg, fisc,</hi> now <hi
                    rend="italic">church, ridge, fish.</hi> A final <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has
                    passed through a guttural or palatal continuant to <hi rend="italic">w</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> forming a diphthong or new vowel, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">boga, laga,</hi><hi rend="italic">doeg,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >heg,</hi><hi rend="italic">dτig,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">bow, law, day, hay,
                    dry. W</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> have disappeared before <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >write, wl·isp; h</hi> final <hi rend="italic">(=gh)</hi> has become <hi
                    rend="italic">f, k, w,</hi> or nothing, as <hi rend="italic">ruh, hoh, boh,
                    deah, hedh,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">rough, hough, bough, dough, high = ruf,
                    hok, bow, dδ, hi. Ii</hi> after a vowel has practically disappeared in standard
                    English, or at most become vocalized, or combined with the vowel, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">hear, bar, more, her.</hi> These and other changes have taken
                    place gradually, and in accordance with well-known phonetic laws; the details as
                    to time and mode may be studied in the special works already named. It may be
                    mentioned that the total loss of grammatical <hi rend="italic">gender</hi> in
                    English, and the almost complete disappearance of <hi rend="italic">cases,</hi>
                    are purely phonetic phenomena. <hi rend="italic">Gender</hi> was practically
                    (whatever its remote origin) the use of adjectives and pronounβ with certain
                    distinctive terminations, in accordance with the <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of
                    nouns to which they were attached; when these distine tive terminations were
                    uniformly levelled to final e, or other-weak sounds, and thus ceased to
                    distinguish nouns into kinds, the distinction into kinds having no other
                    existence disappeared. Thus when J&gt;cri <hi rend="italic">gode</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hors, pone godan hund, pa godαn boc,</hi> became, by phonetic
                    weakening, <hi rend="italic">pe goode hors, pe goode hownd, pe goode boke,</hi>
                    the words <hi rend="italic">horse, hound, book</hi> were no longer different <hi
                    rend="italic">kinds</hi> of nouns; grammatical gender had ceased to exist. The
                    concord of the pronouns is now regulated by <hi rend="italic">rationality</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">sex,</hi> instead of gender, which has no existence in
                    English. The man <hi rend="italic">who</hi> lost <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                    life; the bird <hi rend="italic">which</hi> built <hi rend="italic">its</hi>
                    nest.</p>
                <p>Our remarks from the end of the 14th century have been confined to the standard
                    or literary form of English, for of the other dialects from that date (with the
                    exception of the northern English in Scotland, where it became in a social and
                    literary sense a distinct language), we have no history. We know, however, that
                    they continued to exist as local and popular forms of speech, as well from the
                    fact that they exist still as from the statements of writers during the
                    interval. Thus Puttenham in his <hi rend="italic">Arte of English</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Poesie,</hi> 1589, says—</p>
                <p>“Our maker <hi rend="italic">[i.e.,</hi> poet] therfore at these dayes shall not
                    follow Piers Plowman, nor Gower, nor Lydgate, nor yet Chaucer, for their
                    language is now not of use with us: neither shall he take the termes of
                    Northern-men, such as they use in dayly talke, whether they be noble men or
                    gentle men or of their best clarkes, all is a [ = one] matter; nor in effect any
                    speach used beyond the river of Trent, though no man can deny but that theirs is
                    the purer English Saxon at this day, yet it is not so Courtly nor so currant as
                    our <hi rend="italic">Southerns</hi> English is, no more is the far Westerne
                    mans speach: ye shall therefore take the usual speach of the Court, and that of
                    London and the shires lying about London within lx myles, and not much above. I
                    say not this but that in every shyre of England there be gentlemen and others
                    that speake but specially write as good Sou theme as we of Middlesex or Surrey
                    do, but not the common people of every shire, to whom the gentlemen, and also
                    their learned clarkes do for the most part condescend, but herein we are already
                    ruled by th’ English Dictionaries and other bookes written by learned men.”— <hi

                <p>In comparatively modern times, there has been a revival of interest in these
                    long-neglected forms of English, several of which, following in the wake of the
                    revival of Lowland Scotch last century, have produced a considerable literature
                    in the form of local poems, tales, and “folk-lore.” In these respects
                    Lancashire, Cumberland, Yorkshire, Devonshire, and Dorsetshire, the “far north”
                    and “far west” of Puttenham, where the dialect was felt to be so independent of
                    literary English as not to be branded as a vulgar corruption. of it, stand
                    prominent. More recently the dialects have been investigated philologically, a
                    department in which, as in English philology generally, the name of Richard
                    Garnett takes the lead. The work has been <pb break="no"

                    foundation of a Dialect Society for the investigation of this branch of
                    philology. The researches of Prince L. L. Bonaparte and Mr Ellis have resulted
                    in the classification and mapping of the existing dialects.<note anchored="true"

                    English, and a <hi rend="italic">South-western</hi> dialect occupying Somerset,
                    Wilts, Dorset, Gloucester, and western Hampshire, which, with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Devonian</hi> dialect beyond it, are the descendants of early
                    southern English and the still older West-Saxon of Alfred. This dialect must in
                    the 14th century have been spoken everywhere south of Thames; but the influence
                    of London caused its extinction in Surrey, Sussex, and Kent, so that already in
                    Puttenham it had become “far western.” An <hi rend="italic">East Midland</hi>
                    dialect, extending from south Lincolnshire to London, occupies the cradle-land
                    of the standard English speech, and still shows least variation from it. Between
                    and around these typical dialects are ten others, representing the old Midland
                    proper, or dialects between it and the others already mentioned. Thus “north of
                    Trent” the <hi rend="italic">North-western</hi> dialect of south Lancashire,
                    Cheshire, Derby, and Stafford, with that of <hi rend="italic">Shropshire,</hi>
                    represents the early West Midland English, of which several specimens remain;
                    while the <hi rend="italic">North-eastern</hi> of Nottingham and north
                    Lincolnshire represents the dialect of the <hi rend="italic">Lay of
                    Havelok.</hi> With the <hi rend="italic">North Midland</hi> dialect of
                    south-west Yorkshire, these represent forms of speech which to the modern
                    Londoner, as to Puttenham, are still decidedly northern, though properly
                    intermediate between northern and midland, and preserving interesting traces of
                    the midland pronouns and verbal inflexions. There is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eastern</hi> dialect in the East Anglian counties; a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midland</hi> in Leicester and Warwick shires; a <hi rend="italic">Western</hi>
                    in Hereford, Worcester, and north Gloucestershire, intermediate between
                    south-western and north-western, and representing the dialect of <hi
                    rend="italic">Piers Plowman.</hi> Finally, between the east midland and
                    south-western, in the counties of Buckingham, Oxford, Berks, Hants, Surrey, and
                    Sussex, there is a dialect which must have once been south-western, but of which
                    the most salient characters have been rubbed off by proximity to London and the
                    East Midland speech. In east Sussex and Kent this <hi rend="italic"
                    >South-eastern</hi> dialect attains to a more distinctive character. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Kentish</hi> form of early Southern English evidently maintained
                    its existence more toughly than that of the counties immediately south of
                    London. If we can trust the fidelity of the dialect attributed to Edgar in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lear,</hi> it was still strongly marked in the days of
                    Shakespeare. In the south-eastern corner of Ireland, in the baronies of Forth
                    and Bargy, in county Wexford, a very archaic form of English, of which specimens
                    have been preserved,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    In all probability it dated from the first English invasion. In many parts of
                    Ulster forms of Lowland Scotch dating to the settlement under James I. are still
                    spoken; but the English of Ireland generally seems to represent 16th and 17th
                    century English, as in the pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">tea, wheat (jay,
                    whaic),</hi> largely affected of course by the native Celtic. Beyond the limits
                    of the</p>
                <p>British Isles, English is the language of extensive regions, now or formerly
                    colonies. In all these countries the presence of numerous new objects and new
                    conditions of life has led to the supplementing of the vocabulary by the
                    adoption of words from native languages, and special adaptation of English
                    words. The use of a common literature, however, prevents the overgrowth of these
                    local peculiarities, and also makes them familiar to Englishmeu. It is only in
                    the older states of the American Union that anything like a local dialect has
                    been produced; and even there the so-called Yankee dialect, and Americanisms,
                    are much more archaic English forms which have been lost or have become
                    dialectal in England than a development of the American soil.</p>
                <p>The steps by which English, from being the language of a few thousand invaders
                    along the eastern and southern seaboard of Britain, has been diffused by
                    conquest and colonization over its present area form a subject too large for the
                    limits of this article. It need only be remarked that within the confines of
                    Britain itself the process is not yet complete. Representatives of earlier
                    languages survive in Wales and the Scottish Highlands, though in neither case
                    can the substitution of English be remote. In Ireland, where English was
                    introduced by conquest much later, Irish is still spoken in patches all over the
                    country: though English is understood, and probably spoken after a fashion,
                    everywhere. At opposite extremities of Britain the Cornish of Cornwall and the
                    Norse dialects of Orkney and Shetland died out very gradually in the course of
                    last century. The Manx, or Celtic of Man, is even now in the last stage of
                    dissolution: and in the Channel Isles the Norman <hi rend="italic">patois</hi>
                    of Jersey and Guernsey have largely yielded to English within the last thirty
                    years.</p>

                    nearly as much behind it. (J, A. H. Μ.) <pb break="no"
