                    gentleman of hospitable habits, and of considerable influence, if we may judge
                    from Eliot’s early entrance into public life. Against bis youth no fault has
                    been charged except such as was the natural fruit of a fiery but generous
                    temper, and that it was not entirely spent in idle frolic is proved by the
                    considerable scholarship which he attained. At fifteen he entered Exeter
                    College, Oxford; and, on leaving the university, he studied law at one of the
                    inns of court. He also spent some months travelling in France, Spain, and Italy,
                    in company, for part of the time, with young George Villiers, afterwards duke of
                    Buckingham. At the age of twenty he married the daughter of one of his
                    neighbours, a wealthy Cornish gentleman. He was only twenty-two when, in the
                    distinguished company of Pym and Wentworth, he commenced his parliamentary
                    career, and only twenty-seven when he obtained the appointment of vice-admiral
                    of Devon, with large powers for the defence and control of the commerce of the
                    county. It was not long before the characteristic energy with which he performed
                    the duties of his office involved him in difficulties. After many attempts, in
                    1623 he succeeded, by a clever but dangerous manoeuvre, in entrapping the famous
                    pirate Nutt, who had for years infested the southern coast, inflicting immense
                    damage upon English commerce. The issue is noteworthy, both as the event which
                    first opened Eliot’s eyes to the corruptness of the Government, and as an
                    example of one of the causes which produced the Great Rebellion. The pirate,
                    having gained powerful allies at court by means of bribery, was speedily
                    permitted to recommence his career of plunder; while the vice-admiral, upon
                    charges which could not be substantiated, was flung into the MarshaLsea, and
                    detained there nearly four months.</p>
                <p>A few days after his release Eliot was elected member of Parliament for Newport
                    (February 1624). From the first he perceived that the success of the popular
                    cause required the entire independence of parliament; and his earliest recorded
                    speech was to propose that, as “misreports” were constantly being carried to the
                    king, the deliberations of the House of Commons should be kept strictly secret.
                    In the days of Eliot, such a measure would have carried with it advantages of
                    the first importance; and it was only natural that, in his anxiety to make
                    parliament an efficient check upon the crown, he should forget how necessary was
                    the check upon parliament which would thus have been lost.</p>
                <p>In the first three parliaments of the reign of Charles I. Eliot was the foremost
                    leader of the House of Commons. The House was at that time rich in great
                    statesmen. Upon its benches sat Pym, Hampden, Selden, Coke, and many other
                    sincere and steadfast patriots. But, though in profoundness of erudition one or
                    two, but only one or two, may have surpassed him, neither in force of genius, in
                    fire and power of oratory, in loftiness and ardour of sentiment, in inflexible
                    firmness of resolution, nor in personal bravery and self-devotion, had he auy
                    superior, while in the union of these great qualities which made up his rare and
                    noble character he had no equal. The circumstances of his past life also
                    conduced to fit him for his position. Plis official intercourse with the duke of
                    Buckingham, and a certain important interview between them, in which the duke
                    had incautiously unveiled his design of governing without parliament, should
                    parliament refuse submission, had given him an early and valuable opportunity of
                    gauging the character of the favourite; and a bitter experience had acquainted
                    him with the corruptness of the court. Undeterred by any vestige of personal
                    fear, he dared, in plain and uncompromising language, to expose all the abuses
                    which oppressed the country through innumerable illegal exactions of many kinds
                    and through the venality of the executive; and to point out how it was disgraced
                    abroad by a foreign policy directed by the mere spleen of the favourite, and by
                    the gross mismanagement of every campaign that had been undertaken. He dared to
                    advise parliament to demand an account of the expenditure of the supplies which
                    it had voted, and to refuse further supplies till such an account had been
                    rendered. Nay, he dared even to brave the king’s deadliest hatred by naming
                    repeatedly, with direct and sternest invective, the great duke of Buckingham,
                    the all-powerful favourite, as chiefly responsible for the misgovernment of the
                    country. He did not escape unpunished. In 1626, for drawing a bold parallel
                    between Buckingham and Sejanus, he was sent to the Tower; but the House of
                    Commons refused to proceed with any business till he should be released, and, on
                    his release, passed a vote clearing him from fault, In the same year he was
                    confined for a time in the Gatehouse, whence, careless of mere personal
                    considerations, he ventured to petition the king against forced loans. He was
                    also accused of having, in his capacity of vice-admiral, defrauded the duke of
                    Buckingham, who, among his innumerable offices, held that of admiral of Devon,
                    and was supplanted by a creature of the duke’s. And, finally, a sentence of
                    outlawry was passed upon him.</p>
                <p>But the very fact that he was thus specially singled out for vengeance by the
                    king only increased the confidence reposed in him by the people. In 1628,
                    despite the most strenuous opposition of the court, he was chosen member for his
                    own county of Cornwall; and he resumed his work with undiminished zeal and
                    courage. He at once advised the House to adopt, and firmly to maintain, the only
                    policy which could be effective, namely, to vote no further supplies till they
                    obtained redress of the grievances of which they complained. He joined with
                    Coke, Selden, Littleton, Wentworth, and others in framing the Petition of Right,
                    and, when the first evasive answer was given to that petition, and men scarce
                    knew what to do foi» w ondering. at the king’s madness and audacity, he
                    fearlessly reviewed the events of the whole reign, and proposed a remonstrance
                    to the king, naming the duke of Buckingham as the cause of the kingdom’s
                    wretchedness. And, on the last day of that famous parliament, when Holles and
                    Valentine held the Speaker in the chair by force, it was his voice which read a
                    protest against levying tonnage and poundage and other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0148-0139"/> taxes without consent of Parliament, and against
                    the king’s encouragement of Arminians and Papists (for it is characteristic both
                    of himself and of his epoch that, though no Puritan, he spoke as strongly
                    against the king’s illegal toleration of Papists as against any other of his
                    illegal acts); and also a declaration that whatever minister should “bring in
                    innovation in religion, or seek to extend, or introduce Popery and Arminianism,”
                    or should advise illegal methods of raising money, should be considered “a
                    capital enemy to the commonwealth,” nay, that whoever even yielded compliance to
                    such illegal demands, should be held accessory to the crime. This was the last
                    speech of that session, and Eliot’s last speech of all.</p>
                <p>A few days after, parliament having been dissolved, he was summoned, with Selden,
                    Holies, Valentine, and three other members, before the council. When examined he
                    refused to answer for his conduct in parliament anywhere except before
                    parliament; and he was then, with his companions, committed to “close
                    confinement” in the Tower, books and the use of writing materials being strictly
                    denied. This rigorous treatment was maintained for nearly three months, till
                    Charles found it necessary to give way somewhat to the popular feeling which was
                    expressed by libels against the bishops and the lord-treasurer, and by stern
                    warnings addressed to himself. In May the prisoners were taken before the Court
                    of King’s Bench, when Eliot simply repeated the protest he had made before the
                    council. The case was put off time after time till the long vacation came
                    without its having been heard. Eliot was now, however, allowed to communicate
                    with his friends, among whom his most constant and valued correspondent was
                    Hampden, to borrow books from Sir Robert Cotton’s library, and to employ the
                    tedious hours in writing. He drew up a defence of his conduct, under the title
                    of An Apology for Socrates— “An recte fecerit Socrates quod accusatus non
                    responderit,” and wrote a little book of philosophical meditations, which he
                    called The Monarchy of Man, and an account of the first parliament of Charles
                    I., which he describes on the titlepage as “a thing that concerns posterity
                    ”—Hegotium Posterorum,—and which is of no slight historical value. In February
                    1623 the sentence was at last pronounced, the prisoners being all condemned to a
                    fine; to be imprisoned during the king’s pleasure; and not to be released till
                    they had given security for their good behaviour, had submitted to the king, and
                    had acknowledged their offences. The largest fine was imposed upon Eliot—a fine
                    of £2000, which, however, he never paid, as he had taken the precaution of
                    securing his property against such an event. Twenty-seven years later this
                    sentence was reversed by parliament, and Eliot’s brave assertion of the
                    independence of parliament was confirmed, never to be again questioned.</p>
                <p>The confinement of the other prisoners was gradually made less and less strict,
                    till they were at length allowed full liberty; but Eliot’s spirit, which no
                    weariness or suffering could conquer, disdained to submit where he held no
                    submission to be due, and for him there was no mercy. After more than a year had
                    passed since he first entered the Tower, and the king’s hate had only increased
                    in malignity, on December 21, 1631, the council met to devise new means to
                    subdue his constancy and force him to submission. All admittance to him was now
                    denied except to his sons. Moved into a room which his letters describe as dark,
                    cold, and wretchedly uncomfortable, at length his health gave way, and the
                    doctors prescribed fresh air and exercise. He now addressed the king, having
                    been referred to him by the Court of King’s Bench, to which he had first
                    applied, in a petition, written in simple, manly language, requesting that, for
                    his health’s sake, he might be allowed a temporary release. The answer being
                    that the petition was not sufficiently humble,he expressed himself “heartily
                    sorry that he had displeased His Majesty,” but merely repeated his request with
                    no word of submission. To this no reply was given; and fifteen days after Sir
                    John Eliot had died in the Tower (27th November 1632). His sons humbly begged
                    leave to carry his body to Port Eliot, that he might rest with his fathers, but
                    even this poor request Charles had not magnanimity enough to grant; and, by his
                    express command, Sir John Eliot was “buried in the church of the parish where he
                    died.”</p>
                <p>An excellent life of Sir John Eliot, founded upon elaborate study of his papers
                    and of the history of the period, has been written by John Forster. (τ. Μ.
