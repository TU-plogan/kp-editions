                    which he began the departure, nor yet that of the school which at last arose on
                    the foundations laid by him. His time forced an inner conflict on the art to
                    which his genius was devoted. We must try not to look at him either wholly from
                    a modern stand-point or wholly from that of the age which he closed, but rather
                    to place ourselves, as far as we can, at the line of separation on which he
                    stood, and endeavour to see how he dealt with the perplexing forces of an
                    inevitable transition.</p>
                <p>All that is known about his outward life may be shortly told. He was born in 480
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> on the very day, according to the legend, of the
                    Greek victory at Salamis, where his Athenian parents had taken refuge; and a
                    whimsical fancy has even suggested that his name— <hi rend="italic">son
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Euripus</hi> —was meant to commemorate the first check
                    of the Persian fleet at Artemisium. His father Mnesarchus was at least able to
                    give him a liberal education; it was a favourite taunt with the comic poets that
                    his mother Clito had been a herb-seller—a quaint instance of the tone which
                    public satire could then adopt with plausible effect. At first he was intended,
                    we are told, for the profession of an athlete,— a calling of which he has
                    recorded his opinion with something like the courage of Xenophanes. He seems
                    also to have essayed painting; but at five-and-twenty he brought out his first
                    play, the <hi rend="italic">Peliades,</hi> and thenceforth he was a tragic poet.
                    At thirty-nine he gained the first prize, and in his career of about fifty years
                    he gained it only five times in all. This fact is perfectly consistent with his
                    unquestionably great and growing popularity in his own day. Throughout life he
                    had to compete with Sophocles, and with other poets who represented tragedy of
                    the type consecrated by a splendid tradition. It was but natural that the judges
                    should crown works of that school more frequently than the brilliant experiments
                    of an innovator. The hostile criticism of Aristophanes was witty; and, what has
                    not always been observed, it was true, granting the premise from which
                    Aristophanes starts, that the tragedy of Aeschylus and Sophocles is the only
                    right model. Its unfairness, often extreme,.consists in ignoring the changing
                    conditions of public feeling and taste, and the possibilities, changed
                    accordingly, of an art which could exist only by continuing to please large
                    audiences. It has usually been supposed that the unsparing derision of the comic
                    poets contributed not a little to make the life of Euripides at Athens
                    uncomfortable; and there is certainly one passage (in a fragment of the <hi

                    in reference to the majority of their sex, and to complete the picture of an
                    uneasy private life. He appears to have been repelled by the Athenian democracy,
                    as it tended to become less the rule of the people than of the mob. Thoroughly
                    the son of his day in intellectual matters, he shrank from the coarser aspects
                    of its political and social life. His best word is for the small farmer <hi
                    rend="italic">(autοurgos),</hi> who does not often come to town, or soil his
                    rustic honesty by contact with the crowd of the marketplace.</p>
                <p>About 409 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Euripides left Athens, and after a
                    residence in the Thessalian Magnesia repaired, on the invitation of King
                    Archelaus, to the Macedonian court, where Greeks of distinction were always
                    welcome. Tn his <hi rend="italic">Archelaus</hi> Euripides celebrated that
                    legendary son of Temenus, and head of the Temenid dynasty, who had founded
                    Aegae; and in one of the meagre fragments he evidently alludes to the beneficent
                    energy of his royal host in opening up the wild land of the North. It was at
                    Γella, too, that Euripides composed or completed, and perhaps produced, the <hi

                    him attacked and killed by savage dogs. It is odd that the fate of Actaeon
                    should bo ascribed, by legend, to two distinguished Greek writers, Euripides and
                    Lucian; though in the former case at least the fate has not such appropriateness
                    as the Byzantine biographer discovers in the latter, on the ground that its
                    victim “had waxed rabid against the truth.” The death of Euripides, whatever its
                    manner, occurred in 406 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when <pb break="no"

                    Sophocles followed him in a few months, but not before he had been able to
                    honour the memory of his younger rival by causing his actors to appear with less
                    than the full costume of the Dionysiae festival. Soon afterwards, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Frogs,</hi> Aristophanes pronounced the epitaph of Attic Comedy on
                    Attic Tragedy.</p>
                <p>The historical interest of such a life as that of Euripides consists in the very
                    fact that its external record is so scanty —that, uulike Aeschylus or Sophocles,
                    he had no place in the public action of his time, but dwelt apart as a student
                    and a thinker. He has made his Medea speak of those who, through following quiet
                    paths, have incurred the reproach of apathy <hi rend="italic">(paβυμdav).</hi>
                    Undoubtedly enough of the old feeling for civic life remained to create a
                    prejudice against one who held aloof from the affairs of the city. Quietness
                    (άπ-ραγ/Λοσύ^), in this sense, was still regarded as akin to indolence (αργία).
                    Yet just here we see how truly Euripides was the precursor of that near future
                    which, at Athens, saw the more complete divergence of society from the state.
                    His work is his biography. The first requisite for a just appreciation, both of
                    the artist and of the man, is rightly to apprehend the conditions under which
                    his work wa3 done.</p>
                <p>In an age which is not yet ripe for reflection or for the subtle analysis of
                    character, people are content to express in general types those primary facts of
                    human nature which strike every one. Achilles will stand well enough for the
                    young chivalrous warrior, Odysseus for the man of resource and endurance, even
                    without such elaboration of detail as would enable us surely to recognize the
                    very man—to say, if we met him, this is the Λchille3, the Odysseus, whose exact
                    portrait we know. The poetry of such an age pre3ent3 types rather than
                    individuals. In the case of the Greeks, these types had not merely an artistic
                    and a moral interest; they had, further, a religious interest, because the
                    Greeks believed that the epic heroes, sprang from the gods, were their own
                    ancestors. Direct lineage was the ground on which the Greeks trusted that the
                    Greek gods would help them against other men, speaking barbarian tongues, and
                    other gods, the progenitors of barbarians. Greek Tragedy arose when the choral
                    worship of Dionysus, the god of physical rapture, had engrafted upon it a
                    dialogue between actors who represented some persons of the legeuds consecrated
                    by this faith. Now, in order that the representation should express the3e
                    persons without transgressing the typical character of the legends themselves,
                    and thereby straining or lowering this faith, it is necessary to observe a
                    limit. The dramatist was obliged to refrain from multiplying those minute
                    touches which, by individualizing the characters too highly, would bring them
                    closer, indeed, to daily experience, but would detract from their general value
                    a3 types in which all Hellenic humanity could recognize its own image glorified
                    and raised a step nearer to the immortal gods. This necessity wa3 further
                    enforced by the existence of the Chorus, the original element of the drama, and
                    the very essence of its nature as an act of Dionysiae worship. Those utterances
                    of the Chorus, which to the modern sense are so often platitudes, were not so to
                    the Greeks, just because the moral issues of Tragedy were felt to have the same
                    typical generality as these comments themselves.</p>
                <p>An unerring instinct keeps both Aeschylus and Sophocles within the limits imposed
                    by this law. Euripides was only fifteen year3 younger than Sophocles. But, when
                    Euripides began to write it must have been clear to any man of his genius and
                    culture that, though an established prestige might be maintained, a new poet who
                    sought to construct Tragedy on the old basis would be building on sand. For,
                    first, the popular religion itself—the very foundation of Tragedy—had been
                    undermined. Secondly, scepticism had begun to be busy with the legends which
                    that religion consecrated. Neither gods nor heroes commanded all the old
                    unquestioning faith. Lastly, an increasing number of the audience in the theatre
                    began to be destitute of the training, musical and poetical, which had prepared
                    an earlier generation to enjoy the chaste and placid grandeur of ideal
                    Tragedy.</p>
                <p>Euripides made a splendid effort to maintain the place of Tragedy in the
                    spiritual life of Athens by modifying its interests in the sense which his own
                    generation required. Could not the heroic persons still excite interest if they
                    were made more real,—if, in them, the passions and sorrows of every-day life
                    were portrayed with greater vividness and directness? And might not the less
                    cultivated part of the audience at least enjoy a thrilling plot, especially if
                    taken from the home-legends of Attica? Euripides became the virtual founder of
                    the Romantic Drama. In so far as his work fails, the failure is one which
                    probably no artistic tact could then have wholly avoided. The frame within which
                    he had to work was one which could not be stretched to his plan. The chorus, the
                    masks, the narrow stage, the conventional costumes, the slender opportunities
                    for change of·» scenery, were so many fixed obstacles to the free development of
                    Tragedy in the new direction. But no man of his time could have broken free from
                    these traditions; in attempting to do so he must have wrecked either his fame or
                    his art. It is not the fault of Euripides if in so much of his work we feel the
                    want of harmony between matter and form. Art abhors compromise; and it was the
                    misfortune of Attic Tragedy in his generation that nothing but a compromise
                    could save it. A word must be said on the two devices which have become common
                    phrases of reproach against him—the prologue, and the <hi rend="italic">deus
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">machina.</hi> Doubtless the prologue is a slipshod and
                    sometimes ludicrou3 expedient. But it should be remembered that the audiences of
                    his days were far from being so well versed as their fathers in the mythic lore,
                    and that, on the other hand, a dramatist who wished to avoid trite themes had
                    now to go into the by-ways of mythology. A prologue was often perhaps desirable
                    or necessary for the instruction of the audience. As regards the <hi
                    rend="italic">deus ex</hi><hi rend="italic">machina,</hi> a distinction should
                    be observed between those cases in which the solution is really mechanical, as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Andromache</hi> and perhaps the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orestes,</hi> and those in which it is warranted or required by the plot, aβ in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bacchoe.</hi>
                    The choral songs in Euripides, it may be granted at once, have often nothing to
                    do with the action. But the choru3 was the greatest of difficulties for a poet
                    who was seeking to present drama of romantic tendency in the plastic form
                    consecrated by tradition. So far from censuring Euripides on this score, we
                    should be disposed to regard his management of the chorus as a signal proof of
                    his genius, originality, and skill</p>
                <p>In a poetical career of about fifty years Euripides is said to have written 92
                    dramas, including 8 satyr-plays. The best critics of antiquity allowed 75 as
                    genuine. Nauck has collected 1117 Euripidean fragments. Among these, numbers
                    1092-1117 are doubtful or spurious: numbers 842-1091 are from plays of uncertain
                    title f numbers 1-841 represent fifty-five lost pieces, among which some of the
                    best known are the <hi rend="italic">Andromeda, Antiope,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>(1.) The <hi rend="italic">Alcestis,</hi> as the didascaliae tell us, was brought

                    the character, essentially grotesque, of a mere satyric drama. On the other
                    hand, i t <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n700/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0700-0675"/> has features which distinctly separate it from a
                    Greek tragedy of the normal type. First, the subject belongs to none of the
                    great cycles, but to a by-way of mythology, and involves such strange elements
                    as the servitude of Apollo in a mortal household, the decree of the fates that
                    Admetus must die on a fixed day, and the restoration of the dead Alcestis to
                    life. Secondly, the treatment of the subject is romantic and even
                    fantastic,—strikingly so in the passage where Apollo is directly confronted with
                    the daemonic figure of Thanatos. Lastly, the boisterous, remorseful, and
                    generous Heracles makes—not, indeed, a satyric drama— but a distinctly satyric
                    scene—a scene which, in the frank original, hardly bears the subtle
                    interpretation which in <hi rend="italic">Balaustion</hi> is hinted by the
                    genius of Mr Browning, that Heracles got drunk in order to keep up other
                    people’s spirits. When the happy ending is taken into account, it is not
                    surprising that some should have called the <hi rend="italic">Alcestis</hi> a
                    tragicomedy. But we cannot so regard it. The slight and purely incidental strain
                    of comedy is but a moment of relief between the tragic sorrow and terror of the
                    opening and the joy, no less solemn, of the conclusion. In this respect, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcestis</hi> might more truly be compared <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >1jo</hi> such a drama as the <hi rend="italic">Winter’s Tale;</hi> the loss and
                    recovery of Hermione by Leontes do not form a tragi-comedy because we are amused
                    between-whiles by Autolycus and the clown. It does not seem improbable that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Alcestis</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the earliest of the
                    extant plays—may represent an attempt to substitute for the old satyric drama an
                    after-piece of a kind which, while preserving a satyric element, should stand
                    nearer to Tragedy. The taste and manners of the day were perhaps tiring of the
                    merely grotesque entertainment that old usage appended to the tragedies; just
                    as, in the sphere of comedy, we know from Aristophanes that they were tiring of
                    broad buffoonery. Au original dramatist may have seen an opportunity here.
                    However that may be, the <hi rend="italic">Alcestis</hi> has a peculiar interest
                    for the history of the drama. It marks in the most signal manner, and perhaps at
                    the earliest moment, that great movement which began with Euripides,—the
                    movement of transition from the purely Hellenic drama to the romantic.</p>
                <p>(2.) The <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi> was brought out in 431 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Philoctetes,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictys,</hi> and a lost satyr-play called the <hi rend="italic">Reapers
                    (ThcristcP).</hi> Euripides gained the third prize, the first falling to
                    Euphorion, the son of Aeschylus, and the second to Sophocles. If it is true that
                    Euripides modelled his <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi> on the work of an obscure
                    predecessor, Neophron, at least he made the subject thoroughly his own. Hardly
                    any play was more popular in antiquity with readers and spectators, with actors,
                    or with sculptors. Ennius is said to have translated and adopted it. We do not
                    know how far it may have been used by Ovid in his lost tragedy of the same name;
                    but it certainly inspired the rhetorical performance of Seneca, which may be
                    regarded as bridging the interval between Euripides and modern adaptations. We
                    may grant at once that the <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi> of Euripides is not a
                    faultless play; that the dialogue between the heroine and Aegeus is not happily
                    conceived; that the murder of the children lacks an adequate dramatic motive;
                    that there is something of a moral anti-climax in the arrangements of Medea,
                    before the deed, for her personal safety. But the <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi>
                    remains a tragedy of first rate power. It is admirable for the splendid force
                    with which the character of the strange and strong-hearted woman, a barbarian
                    friendless among Hellenes, is thrown out against the background of Hellenic life
                    in Corinth. Those modern versions of the drama which have recently been
                    illustrated by actresses of genius develop the romantic element beyond the limit
                    of Euripides · he has nothing like the wavering and the final obedience to a
                    Greek instinct of the children who have to make their choice—who slowly and
                    silently turn away from their barbarian mother, and move towards the
                    outstretched arms of Jason. Yet the essential motive of the pathos there is true
                    to the Greek poet’s conception. It is the pro found contrast between the Greek
                    and thenon-Greek nature —the hopeless isolation in Greece of the alien who has
                    left everything to follow Jason—that Euripides has drawn with such mastery. It
                    may be asked, could either Aeschylus or Sophocles, in their different
                    manifestations of the genuinely Hellenic spirit, have shown this more
                    cosmopolitan sympathy, this insight into the strength and the anguish of a
                    nature not Hellenic? Here, too, Euripides belongs to the coming time.</p>
                <p>(3.) The extant <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Stephaηe-phoros,</hi> the “wreath-bearer,”
                    from the garland of flowers which, in the opening scene, the hero offers to
                    Artemis— was not the first drama of Euripides on this theme. In an earlier play
                    of the same name, we are told, he had shocked both the moral and the aesthetic
                    sense of Athens. In this earlier <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus,</hi> Phaedra
                    herself had confessed her love to her step-son, and, when repulsed, had falsely
                    accused him to Theseus, who doomed him to death; at the sight of the corpse, she
                    had been moved to confess her crime, and had atoned for it by a voluntary death.
                    This first <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi> is cited as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hippolytzιs the Veiled</hi> (καλυ7rro∕z∈vov), either, as Toup and Welcher
                    thought, from Hippolytus covering his face in horror, or, as Bentley with more
                    likelihood suggested, because the youth’s shrouded corpse was brought upon the
                    scene. It can scarcely be doubted that the chief dramatic defect of our <hi
                    rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi> is connected with the unfavourable reception of
                    its predecessor. Euripides had been warned that limits must be observed in the
                    dramatic portrayal of a morally repulsive theme. In the later play, accordingly,
                    the whole action is made to turn on the jealous feud between Aphrodite, the
                    goddess of love, and Artemis, the goddess of chastity. Phaedra not only shrinks
                    from breathing her secret to Hippolytus, but destroys herself when she learns
                    that she is rejected. But the natural agency of human passion is now replaced by
                    a supernatural machinery; the slain son and the bereaved father are no longer
                    the martyrs of sin, the tragic witnesses of an inexorable law; rather they and
                    Phaedra are alike the puppets of a divine caprice, the scapegoats of an Olympian
                    quarrel in which they have no concern. But if the dramatic effect of the whole
                    is thus weakened, the character of Phaedra is a fine psychological study; and,
                    as regards form, the play is one of the most brilliant. Bceckh <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De Tragcediae Groec.</hi><hi rend="italic">Principiis,</hi> p. 180 f.) is
                    perhaps too ingenious in finding an allusion to the plague at Athens (430 <hi

                <p>(4.) The <hi rend="italic">Hecuba</hi> may be placed about 425 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Thucydides (iii. 104) notices the purification of
                    Delos by the Athenians, and the restoration of the Panionic festival there, in
                    426 B.c.—an event to which the choral passage, V. 462 f., probably refers. It
                    appears more hazardous to take V. 650 f. as an allusion to the Spartan mishap at
                    Pylos. The subject of the play is the revenge of Hecuba, the widowed queen of
                    Priam, on Polymestor, king of Thrace, who had murdered her youngest son
                    Polydorus, after her daughter Polyxena had already been sacrificed by the Greeks
                    to the shade of Achilles. The two calamities which befall Hecuba have no direct
                    connexion with each other. In this sense it is an unanswerable objection that
                    the play lacks unity of design. On the other hand, both event3 serve the same
                    end,—viz., to heighten the tragic pathos <pb break="no"

                    figure of Hecuba. The chief interest of the drama consists in its illustration
                    of the skill with which Euripides, while failing to satisfy the requirements of
                    artistic drama, could sustain interest by an ingeniously woven plot. It is a
                    representative <hi rend="italic">Intriguenstiick,</hi> and well exemplifies the
                    peculiar power which recommended Euripides to the poets of the New Comedy.</p>
                <p>(5.) The <hi rend="italic">Andromache,</hi> according to a notice in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scholia Veneta</hi> (446) was not acted at Athens, at least in the
                    author’s life-time; though some take the words in the Greek argument (το δράμα
                    <hi rend="italic">τ&lt;hv</hi> δεύτερων) to mean that it was among those which
                    gained a second prize. The invective on the Spartan character which is put into
                    the mouth of Andromache contains the words, αδίκως <hi rend="italic">eoτvχfiτ
                    av</hi> Ελλάδα, and this, with other indications, points to the Peloponnesian
                    successes of the years 424-422 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Andromache, the
                    widow of Hector, has become the captive and concubine of Neoptolemus, son of
                    Achilles. During his absence, her son Molossus ' is taken from her, with the aid
                    of Menelaus, by her jealous rival Hermione. Mother and son are rescued from
                    death by Peleus; but meanwhile Neoptolemus is slain at Delphi through the
                    intrigues of Orestes. The goddess Thetis now appears, ordains that Andromache
                    shall marry Helenus, and declares that Molossus shall found a line of Epirote
                    kings, while Peleus shall become immortal among the gods of the sea. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Andromache</hi> is a poor play. The contrasts, though striking,
                    are harsh and coarse, and the compensations dealt out by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >deus ex</hi><hi rend="italic">machina</hi> leave the moral sense wholly
                    unsatisfied. Technically the piece is noteworthy as bringing on the scene four
                    characters at once—Andromache, Molossus, Peleus, and Menelaus (v. 545 f.)</p>
                <p>(6.) The <hi rend="italic">Ion</hi> is an admirable drama, the finest of those
                    plays which deal with legends specially illustrating the traditional glories of
                    Attica. It is also the most perfect example of the poet’s skill in the structure
                    of dramatic intrigue. For its place in the chronological order there are no data
                    except those of style and metre. Judging by these, Hermann would place it
                    “neither after 01. 89, nor much before ”— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> somewhere
                    between 424 and 421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and this may be taken as
                    approximately correct. The scene is laid throughout at the temple of Delphi. The
                    young Ton is a priest in the temple of Delphi when Xuthus and his wife Creusa,
                    daughter of Erechtheus, come to inquire of the god concerning their
                    childlessness; and it is discovered that Ion is the son of Creusa by the god
                    Apollo. Athena herself appears, and commands that Ion shall be placed on the
                    throne of Athens, foretelling that from him shall spring the four Attic tribes,
                    the Teleontes (priests), Hopletes (fighting-men), Argadeis (husbandmen) and
                    Aigikoreis (herdsmen). The play must have been peculiarly effective on the
                    Athenian stage, not only by its situations, butjιhrough its appeal to Attic
                    sympathies.</p>
                <p>(ι .) Γhe <hi rend="italic">Suppliants</hi> who give their name to the play are
                    Argive women, the widows of Argive warriors slain before the walls of Thebes,
                    who, led by Adrastus king of Argos, come as suppliants to the altar of Demeter
                    at Eleusis. Creon, king of Thebes, has refused burial to their dead lords. I he
                    Athenian king Theseus demands of Creon that he shall grant the funeral rites;
                    the refusal is followed by a battle in which the Thebans are vanquished, and the
                    bodies of the Argive dead are then brought to Eleusis. At the close the goddess
                    Athena appears, and ordains that a close alliance shall be formed between Athens
                    and Argos. Some refer the play to 417 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.o.,</hi> when the
                    democratic party at Athens rose against the oligarchs. But a more probable date
                    is 420 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when, through the agency of Alcibiades,
                    Athens and Argos concluded a defensive alliance. The play has a strongly marked
                    rhetorical character, and is, in fact, a panegyric, with an immediate political
                    aim, on Athens as the champion of humanity against Thebe3.</p>
                <p>(8.) The <hi rend="italic">Heracleidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a companion
                    piece to the <hi rend="italic">Suppliants,</hi> and of the same period,—is
                    decidedly inferior in merit. Here, too, there are direct references to
                    contemporary history. The defeat of Argos by the Spartans in 418 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> strengthened the Argive party who were in favour of
                    discarding the Athenian for the Spartan alliance (Thue. v. 76). In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Heracleidae,</hi> the sons of the dead Heracles, persecuted by the
                    Argive Eurystheus, are received and sheltered at Athens. Thus, while Athens is
                    glorified, Sparta, whose kings are descendants of the Heracleidae, is reminded
                    how unnatural would be an alliance between herself and Argos.</p>
                <p>(9.) The <hi rend="italic">Heracles Mainomenos,</hi> which, on grounds of style,
                    can scarcely be put later than 420-417 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> shares
                    with the two last plays the purpose of exalting Athens in the person of Theseus.
                    Heracles returns from Hades,— whither, at the command of Eurystheus, he went to
                    bring back Cerberus,—just in time to save his wife Megara and his children from
                    being put to death by Lycus of Thebes, whom he slays. Ashe is offering lustral
                    sacrifice after the deed, he is suddenly stricken with madness by Lyssa (Fury),
                    the daemonic agent of his enemy the goddess Hera, and in his frenzy he slays his
                    wife and children. Theseus finds him, in his agony of despair, about to kill
                    himself, and persuades him to come to Athens, there to seek grace and pardon
                    from the gods. The unity of the plot may be partly vindicated by observing that
                    the slaughter of Lycus entitled Heracles to the gratitude of Thebes, whereas the
                    slaughter of his own kinsfolk made it unlawful that he should remain there;
                    thus, having found a refuge only to lose it, Heracles has no hope left but in
                    Athens, whose praise is the true theme of the entire drama.</p>
                <p>(10.) <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia among the Tauri,</hi> which metre and diction
                    mark as one of the later plays, is also one of the best,— excellent both in the
                    management of a romantic plot and in the delineation of character. The scene is
                    laid at the temple of Artemis in the Tauric Cheronese (the Crimea) —on the site
                    of the modern Balaclava. Iphigenia, who had been doomed to die at Aulis for the
                    Greeks, had been snatched from that death by Artemis, and had become priestess
                    of the goddess at the Tauric shrine, where human victims were immolated. Two
                    strangers, who had landed among the Tauri, have been sentenced to die at the
                    altar. She discovers in them her brother Orestes and his friend Pylades. They
                    plan an escape,—are recaptured,—and are finally delivered by the goddess Athene,
                    who commands Thoas, king of the land, to permit their departure. Iphigenia,
                    Orestes, and Γylades return to Greece, and establish the worship of the Tauric
                    Artemis at Brauron and Ilalae in Attica. The drama of Euripides necessarily
                    suggests a comparison with that of Goethe; and many readers will probably also
                    feel that, while Goethe is certainly not inferior in fineness of ethical
                    portraiture, he has the advantage in his management of the catastrophe. But it
                    is only-just to Euripides to remember that, while his competitor had free scope
                    of treatment, he, a Greek dramatist, was bound to the motive of the Greek
                    legend, and was obliged to conclude with the foundation of the Attic wc⅛hip.</p>

                    There is hardly a plot in the proper sense,—only an accumulation of sorrows on
                    the heads of the passive sufferers. The piece is less a drama than a pathetic
                    spectacle, closing with the crash of the Trojan towers in flame and ruin. The

                    the “land of Aetna over against Carthage” (v. 220) speaks of it as “renowned for
                    the trophies of prowess,”—a topic, surely, not of encouragement but of
                    warning.</p>
                <p>(12.) The <hi rend="italic">Helena—</hi> produced, as we learn from the
                    Aristophanic scholia, in 412 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the year of the
                    lost <hi rend="italic">Andromeda,—</hi> is not one of its author’s happier
                    efforts. It is founded on a strange variation of the Trojan myth, first adopted
                    by Stesichorus in his Palinode—that only a wraith of Helen passed to Troy, while
                    the real Helen was detained in Egypt. In this play, she is rescued from the
                    Egyptian king, Theoclymenus, by a ruse of her husband Menelaus, who brings her
                    safely back to Greece. The romantic element thus engrafted on the Greek myth is
                    more than fantastic: it is well-nigh grotesque. We are, in fact, dangerously
                    close to the verge of parody. The comic poets —notably Aristophanes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesmophoriazusoe</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> felt this; nor can
                    we blame them if they ridiculed a piece in which the mode of treatment was so
                    discordant with the spirit of Greek tradition, and so irreconcilable with all
                    that constituted the higher meaning of Greek Tragedy.</p>
                <p>(13.) <hi rend="italic">Phoenissoe</hi> was brought out, with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuomaus</hi> and the C%ryi⅛&gt;2&gt;wβ, in 411 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the year in which the recall of Alcibiades was
                    decreed by the army at Samos, and, after the fall of the Four Hundred, ratified
                    by the Assembly at Athens (Thuc. viii. 81, 97). The dialogue between Iocaste and
                    Polyneices on the griefs of banishment (τiτo <hi rend="italic">στepeσθαL
                    π-ατpi8ος,</hi> v. 388 f.) lias a certain emphasis which certainly looks like an
                    allusion to the pardon of the famous exile. The subject of the play is the same
                    as that of the Aeschylean <hi rend="italic">Seven against Thebes—</hi> the war
                    of succession in which Argos supported Polyneices against his brother Eteocles.
                    The Phoenician maidens who form the chorus are imagined to have been on their
                    way from Tyre to Delphi, where they were destined for service in the temple,
                    when they were detained at Thebes by the outbreak of the war—a device which
                    affords a contrast to the Aeschylean chorus of Theban elders, and which has also
                    a certain fitness in view of the legends connecting Thebes with Phoenicia. But
                    Euripides has hardly been successful in the rivalry—which he has even pointed by
                    direct allusions—with Aeschylus. The <hi rend="italic">Phoenissoe</hi> is full
                    of brilliant passages, but it is rather a series of effective scenes than an
                    impressive drama.</p>
                <p>(14.) Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Lgs.</hi> 15) says that, when Athens had
                    surrendered to Lysander (404 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> and when the fate
                    of the city was doubtful, a Phocian officer happened to sing at a banquet of the
                    leaders the first song of the chorus in the <hi rend="italic">Electra</hi> of
                    Euripides—</p>

                    it seemed a cruel deed to destroy for ever the city so famous once, the mother
                    of such men.” The character of the <hi rend="italic">Electra,</hi> in metre and
                    in diction, seems to show that it belongs to the poet’s latest years. If Midler
                    were right in referring to the Sicilian expedition the closing passage in which
                    the Dioscuri declare that they haste “to the Sicilian sea, to save ships upon
                    the deep” (v. 1347), theu the play could not be later than 413 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But it may with more probability be placed shortly
                    before the <hi rend="italic">Orestes,</hi> which in some respects it much
                    resembles: perhaps in or about the year 410 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c. No</hi>
                    play of Euripides has been more severely criticised. The reason is evident. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Choepkοri</hi> of Aeschylus and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Electra</hi> of Sophocles appear to invite a direct comparison with this drama.
                    But, as the present writer has ventured to suggest elsewhere,<note

                    criticism as that of Schlegel should remember that works of art are proper
                    subjects of direct comparison only when the theories of art which they represent
                    have a common basis. It is surely unmeaning to contrast the elaborate homeliness
                    of the Euripidean <hi rend="italic">Electra</hi> with the severe grandeur of its
                    rivals. Aeschylus and Sophocles, as different exponents of an artistic
                    conception which is fundamentally the same, may be profitably compared;
                    Euripides interprets another conception, and must be tried by other principles.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Electra</hi> is, in truth, a daring experiment—daring,
                    because the theme is one which the elder school had made peculiarly its own. We
                    are unable to share Hartung’s enthusiasm for the success of the experiment. But
                    we protest against the injustice of trying it by a standard foreign to the
                    poet’s aim.</p>
                <p>(15.) The <hi rend="italic">Orestes,</hi> acted in 408, bears the mark of the age
                    in the prominence which Euripides gives to the assembly of Argos,—which has to
                    decide the fate of Orestes and Electra,—and to rhetorical pleading. The plot
                    proceeds with sufficient clearness to the point at which Orestes and Electra
                    have been condemned to death. But the later portion of the play, containing the
                    intrigues for their rescue and the final achievement of their deliverance, is
                    both too involved and too inconsequent for a really tragic effect. Just as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Electra,</hi> the heroic persons of the drama are reduced
                    to the level of commonplace. There is not a little which borders on the
                    ludicrous, and it can be seen bow easy would have been the passage from such
                    tragedy as this to the restrained parody in which the Middle Comedy delighted.
                    It is, however, inconceivable that, as some have supposed, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orestes</hi> can have been a deliberate compromise between tragedy and farce.
                    It cannot have been meant to be played, as a fourth piece, instead of a regular
                    satyric drama. Rather it indicates the level to which the heroic tragedy itself
                    had descended under the treatment of a school which was at least logical. The
                    celebrity of the play in the ancient world,—and, as Mr Paley observes, there are
                    more ancient quotations from the <hi rend="italic">Orestes</hi> than from all
                    the extant plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles together—is perhaps partly explained
                    by the unusually frequent combination in this piece of striking sentiment with
                    effective situation.</p>
                <p>(16.) The <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia at</hi><hi rend="italic">Aulis,</hi> like
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bacchoe,</hi> was brought out only after the death of
                    Euripides. It is a very brilliant and beautiful play,—probably left by the
                    author in an unfinished state,—and has suffered from interpolation more largely,
                    perhaps, than any other of his works. As regard its subject, it forms a prelude
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia in</hi><hi rend="italic">Tauris.</hi>
                    Iphigenia has been doomed by her father Agamemnon to die at Aulis, as Calchas
                    declares that Artemis claims such a sacrifice before the adverse winds can
                    fall.</p>
                <p>The genuine play, as we have it, breaks off at v. 1508, when Iphigenia has been
                    led to the sacrificial altar. A spurious epilogue, of wretched workmanship (v.
                    1509- 1628), relates, in the speech of a messenger, how Artemis saved the
                    maiden. We may, however, congratulate ourselves on possessing, even in its
                    present form, so large a part of this fine work,—probably the latest upon which
                    Euripides was engaged.</p>
                <p>(17.) The <hi rend="italic">Bacchoe,</hi> unlike the preceding play, appears to
                    have been finished by its author, although it is said not to have been acted, on
                    the Athenian stage at least, till after his death. It was composed, or
                    completed, during the residence of Euripides with Archelaus, and in all
                    probability was originally designed for representation in Macedonia,—a region
                    with whose traditions of orgiastic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n703/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0703-0678"/> worship the Dionysus myth was so congenial. The
                    play is sometimes quoted as the <hi rend="italic">Pentheus.</hi> It has been
                    justly observed that Euripides seldom named a piece from the chorus, unless the
                    chorus bore an important part in the action or the leading action was divided
                    between several persons. Possibly, however, in this instance he may designedly
                    have chosen a title which would at once interest the Macedonian public. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pentheus</hi> would suggest a Greek legend about which they might
                    know or care little. The <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> would at once announce a
                    theme connected with rites familiar to the northern land.</p>
                <p>It is a magnificent play, alone among extant Greek tragedies in picturesque
                    splendour, and in that sustained glow of Dionysiae enthusiasm to which the keen
                    irony lends the strength of contrast. If Euripides had left nothing else, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> would place him in the first rank of poets, and
                    would prove his possession of a sense rarely manifested by Greek poets,—perhaps
                    by no one of his own contemporaries in equal measure except Aristophanes,—a
                    feeling for natural beauty lit up by the play of fancy. Mr R. V. Tyrrell, in his
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae,</hi> has given the true answer to the
                    theory that the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> is a recantation. Euripides had
                    never rejected the facts which formed the basis of the popular religion. He had
                    rather sought to interpret them in a manner consistent with belief in a
                    benevolent Providence. The really striking thing in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacchae</hi> is the spirit of contentment and of composure which it
                    breathes,—as if the poet had ceased to' be vexed by the seeming contradictions
                    which had troubled him before. Nor should it be forgotten that, for the Greek
                    mind of his age, the victory of Dionysus in the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi>
                    carried a moral even more direct than the victory of Aphrodite in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hippolytus.</hi> The great nature-powers who give refreshment to
                    mortals cannot be robbed of their due tribute without provoking a nemesis. The
                    refusal of such a homage is not, so the Greeks deemed, a virtue in itself: in
                    the sight of the gods it may be only a cold form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vβpιs,</hi> overweening self-reliance—the quality personified in Pentheus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> was always an exceptionally popular play,—
                    partly because its opportunities as a spectacle fitted it for gorgeous
                    representation, and so recommended it for performance at courts and on great
                    public occasions. “Demetrius the Cynic” (says Lucian) “saw an illiterate person
                    at Corinth reading a very beautiful poem,—the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> of
                    Euripides, I think it was; he was at the place where the messenger narrates the
                    doom of Pentheus and the deed of Agave. Demetrius snatched the book from him and
                    tore it up, saying, ‘ it is better for Pentheus to be torn up at once by me than
                    to be mangled over and over again by you.’”</p>
                <p>(18.) The <hi rend="italic">Cyclo}</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> is,</hi> of
                    uncertain date, is the only extant example of a satyric drama. The plot is taken
                    mainly from the story of Odysseus and Polyphemus in the 9th book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi> In order to be really successful in farce of this
                    kind, a poet should have a fresh feeling for the nature of the art parodied. It
                    is because Euripides was not in accord with the spirit of the heroic myths that
                    he is not strong in mythic travesty. His own tragedies,—such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Helen,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Plectra,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orestes,—</hi> had, in their several ways, contributed to destroy
                    the meaning of satyric drama. They had done gravely very much what satyric drama
                    aimed at doing grotesquely. They had made the heroic persons act and talk like
                    ordinary men and women. The finer side of such parody had lest its edge; only
                    broad comedy remained.</p>
                <p>(19.) The <hi rend="italic">Rhesus</hi> is still held by some to be what the
                    didascaliae and the grammarians call it,—a work of Euripides; and Mr Paley has
                    ably supported this view. But the scepticism first declared by Valcknär has
                    steadily gained ground, and the <hi rend="italic">Rhesus</hi> is now almost
                    universally recognized as spurious. The art and the style, still more evidently
                    the feeling and the mind, of Euripides are absent. If it cannot be ascribed to a
                    disciple of his matured school, it is still less like the work of an
                    Alexandrian. The most probable view seems to be that which assigns it to a
                    versifier of small dramatic power in the latest days of Attic Tragedy. It has
                    this literary interest, that it is the only extant play of which the subject is
                    directly taken from our <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> of which the tenth
                    book,—the ∆oλωvcια,—has been followed by the playwright with a closeness which
                    is sometimes mechanical.</p>
                <p>When the first protests of the comic poets were over, Euripides was secure of a
                    wide and lasting renown. As the old life of Athens passed away, as the old
                    faiths lost their meaning and the peculiarly Greek instincts in art lost their
                    truth and freshness, Aeschylus and Sophocles might cease to be fully enjoyed
                    save by a few; but Euripides could still charm · by qualities more readily and
                    more universally recognized. The comparative nearness of his diction to the
                    idiom of ordinary life rendered him less attractive to the grammarians of
                    Alexandria than authors whose erudite form afforded a better scope for the
                    display of learning or the exercise of ingenuity. But there were two aspects in
                    which he engaged their attention. They loved to trace the variations which he
                    had introduced into the standard legends. And they sought-to free his text from
                    the numerous interpolations which even then had resulted from his popularity on
                    the stage. Philochorus (about 30G-260 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> best
                    known for his <hi rend="italic">Atthis,</hi> dealt, in his treatise on
                    Euripides, especially with the mythology of the plays. From 300 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to the age of Augustus, a long series of critics
                    busied themselves with this poet. The first systematic arrangement of his
                    reputed works is ascribed to Dicaearchus and Callimachus in the early part of
                    the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Among those who furthered the
                    exact study of his text, and of whose work some traces remain in the extant
                    scholia, were Aristophanes of Byzantium, Callistratus, Apollodorus of Tarsus,
                    Timachidas, and pre-eminently Didymus; probably also Crates of Pergamus and
                    Aristarchus. At Rome Euripides was early made known through the translations of
                    Ennius and the freer adaptations of Pacuvius. When Hellenic'civilization was
                    spread through the East, the mixed populations of the new settlements welcomed a
                    dramatic poet whose taste and whose sentiment were not too severely or
                    exclusively Attic. The Parthian Orodes aud his court were witnessing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> of Euripides when the Agave of the hour was suddenly
                    enabled to lend a ghastly reality to the terrible scene of frenzied triumph by
                    displaying the gory head of the Roman Crassus. Mommsen has noted the moment as
                    one in which the power of Rome and the genius of Greece were simultaneously
                    abased in the presence of sultanism. So far as Euripides is concerned, the
                    incident may suggest another and a more pleasing reflection; it may remind us
                    how the charm of his humane genius had penetrated the recesses of the barbarian
                    East, aud had brought to rude and fierce peoples at least some dim and distant
                    apprehension of that gracious w orld in w hich the great spirits of ancient
                    Hellas had moved. A quaintly significant testimony to the popularity of
                    Euripides is afforded by a strange composition, probably of the 4th century
                    A.D., the Χριστός ττάσχωκ This drama, narrating the events which preceded and
                    attended the Passion, is a cento of no less than 2610 verses, taken from the
                    plays of Euripides, principally from the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Troades,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rhesus.</hi> The
                    traditional ascription of the authorship to Gregory of Nazianzus is now
                    generally rejected; a more probable conjecture assigns it to Apollinaris of
                    Laodicea, and places the date of composition at about 330 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the value of the piece for the diplomatic criticism of Euripides is necessarily
                    very considerable; and it was diligently used both by Valcknär and by

                <p>Dante, who does not mention Aeschylu3 or Sophocles, places Euripides, with the
                    tragic poets Antiphon and Agathon, and the lyrist Simonides, in the first circle
                    of Purgatory (xxii. 106), among those piue</p>

                    respect for his correspondent’s powers as a peace-maker. In popular literature,
                    too, where Aeschylus and Sophocles were as yet <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    little known, the 16 th and 17th centuries testify to the favour bestowed upon
                    Euripides. Gascoyne’s <hi rend="italic">Jocasta,</hi>. played at Gray’s Inn in
                    1566, was a free transcript from the <hi rend="italic">Phoenissas.</hi> Among
                    early French translations from Euripides, may be mentioned the version of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia in</hi><hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi> by Sibilet in
                    1549, and that of the <hi rend="italic">Hecuba</hi> by Bυuchetel in 1550. About
                    a century later Racine gave the world his <hi rend="italic">Andromaque,</hi> his
                    <hi rend="italic">Iphigénie,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Phèdre;</hi> and
                    many have held that, at least in the last-named of these, “the disciple of
                    Euripides” has excelled his master. Bernhardy notices that the performance of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hippolytus</hi> at Berlin in 1851 seemed to show that, for
                    the modern stage, the <hi rend="italic">Phèdre</hi> has the advantage of its
                    Greek original. Ricine’s great English contemporary seems to have known aui to
                    have liked Euripides better than the other Greek tragedians. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Reason of Church Government</hi> Milton certainly speaks of “those
                    dramatic constitutions in which Sophocles and Euripides reign;” in the preface
                    to his own drama, again, he joins the names of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
                    Euripides,—“the three tragic poets unequalled yet by any.” But the <hi
                    rend="italic">Samson</hi><hi rend="italic">Agonistes</hi> itself clearly shows
                    that Miltoa s chief model in this kind was the dramatist whom he himself has
                    called—as if to suggest the skill of Euripides in the delineation of pathetic
                    women—“sad Electra’s poet;” and the work bears a special mark of this preference
                    in the use of Euripidean monodies. In the second half of the</p>
                <p>• 18th century such men as Winckelmann (1717-1768) and</p>
                <p>Lessing (1729-1781) gave a new life to the study of the antique. Hitherto the art
                    of the old world had been better <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> known through
                    Roman than through Greek interpreters.</p>
                <p>The basis of the revived classical taste had been Latin. But now men gained a
                    finer perception of those characteristics which belong to the Greek work of the
                    great time, a fuller sense of the difference between the Greek and the Roman
                    genius where each is at its best, and generally a clearer recognition of the
                    qualities which distinguish ancient art in its highest purity from modern
                    romantic types. Euripides now became the object of criticism from a new point of
                    view. He was compared with Aeschylus and Sophocles as representatives of that
                    ideal Greek tragedy</p>
                <p>• which ranges with the purest type of sculpture. Thus tried, he was found
                    wanting; and he was condemned with all the rigour of a newly illuminated zeal.
                    Niebuhr (1776-1831) judged him harshly; but no critic approached</p>
                <p>. Schlegel (1767-1845) in severity of one-sided censure.</p>
                <p>Schlegel, in fact, will scarcely allow that Euripides is tolerable except by
                    comparison with Racine. Tieck (1773-1853) showed truer appreciation for a
                    brother artist, when he described the work of Euripides as the dawn of a
                    romantic poetry haunted by dim yearnings and forebodings. Goethe— who, according
                    to Bernhardy, knows Euripides only “at a great distance” (der ihn aus weiter
                    Ferne kennt)—certainly admired him highly, and has left an interesting memorial
                    of Euripidean study in his attempted reconstruction of the lost <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaethon.</hi> There are some passages in Goethe’s conversations
                    with Eckermann wlfch form effective quotations against the Greek poet’s real or
                    supposed detractors. “To feel and respect a great personality, one must be
                    something oneself. All those who denied the sublime to Euripides, were either
                    poor wretches incapable of comprehending such sublimity, or shameless
                    charlatans, who, in their presumption, wished to make more of themselves than
                    they were.” “A poet whom Socrates called his friend, whom Aristotle lauded, whom
                    Alexander admired, and for whom Sophocles and the city of Athens put on mourning
                    on hearing of his death, must certainly have been some one. If a modern man like
                    Schlegel must pick out faults in so great an ancient, he ought only to do it
                    upon his knees.” (Symonds, <hi rend="italic">Greek Poets,</hi> i. 230.) We yield
                    to no one in admiration of Goethe; but we cannot think that these rather
                    bullying utterances are favourable examples of his method in aesthetic
                    discussion; nor have they any logical force exceptas against those—if there be
                    any such—who deny that Euripides is a great poet. One of the most striking of
                    recent criticisms on Euripides is the sketch by Mommsen in his history of Rome.
                    It is, in our opinion, less than just to Euripides as an artist. But it
                    indicates, with true historical insight, his place in the development of his
                    art, the operation of those external conditions which made him what he was, and
                    the nature of his influence on succeeding ages.</p>
                <p>The manuscript tradition of Euripides has a very curious and instructive history.
                    It throws a suggestive light on the capricious nature of the process by which
                    some of the greatest literary treasures have been saved or lost. Nine plays of
                    Euripides were selected, probably in early Byzantine times, for popular and
                    educational use. These were,— <hi rend="italic">Alcestis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Andromache, Hecuba,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hippolytus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Medea, Orestes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Phoenissoe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhesus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Troades.</hi> This list includes at least two
                    plays, the <hi rend="italic">Andromache</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troades,</hi> which, even in the small number of the extant dramas, are
                    universally allowed to be of very inferior merit—to say nothing of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhesus,</hi> which is generally allowed to be spurious. On the
                    other hand, the list omits at least three plays of first-rate beauty and
                    excellence, the very flower, indeed, of the extant collection—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ion,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tauris,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    last certainly, in its own kind, by far the most splendid work of Euripides that
                    we possess. Had these three plays been lost, it is not too much to say that the
                    modern estimate of Euripides must have been decidedly lower. But all the ten
                    plays not included in the select list had a narrow escape of being lost, and, as
                    it is, have come to us in a much less satisfactory condition.</p>
                <p>Kirchhoff has been the first, in his editions, thoroughly to investigate the
                    history and the affinities of the Euripidean manuscripts. All our MSS. are, he
                    thinks, derived from a lost archetype of the 9th or 10th century, which
                    contained the nineteen plays (counting the <hi rend="italic">Rhesus')</hi> now
                    extant. From this archetype a copy, also lost, was made about 1100 A.D.,
                    containing only the nine select plays. This copy became the source of all our
                    best MSS. for those plays. They are,—(1) Marcianus 471, in the library of St
                    Mark at Venice (12th century): <hi rend="italic">Andromache, Hecuba,</hi><hi

                    century, nine plays; (3) Parisinus 2712, 13th century, 7 plays (all but <hi
                    rend="italic">Troades</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhesus).</hi> Of the same
                    stock, but inferior, are (4) Marcianus 468, 13th century: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hecuba, Orestes, Medea</hi> (v. 1-42), <hi rend="italic">Orestes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Phoenissoe;</hi> (5) Havniensis (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hafnioe,</hi> Copenhagen, according to Mr Paley), a late transcript from a MS.
                    resembling Vat. 909, nine plays. A second family of MSS. for the nine plays,
                    sprung from the same copy, but modified by a Byzantine recension of the 13th
                    century, is greatly inferior.</p>
                <p>The other ten plays have come to us only through the preservation of two MSS.,
                    both of the 14th century, and both ultimately derived, as Kirchhoff thinks, from
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n705/mode/1up"

                    >Furens.</hi> By far the greatest number of Euripidean MSS. contain only three

                    >Phoenissoe</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> these having been chosen out of the
                    select nine for school use—probably in the 14th century.</p>
                <p>It is to be remembered that, as a selection, the nine chosen plays of Euripides
                    correspond to those seven of Aeschylus and those seven of Sophocles which alone
                    remain to us. If, then, these nine did not include the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigenia in</hi><hi rend="italic">Tauris,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi>
                    or the <hi rend="italic">Bacchee,</hi> may we not fairly infer that the lost
                    plays of the other two dramatists comprised works at least equal to any that
                    have been preserved I May we not even reasonably doubt whether we have received
                    those masterpieces by which their highest excellence should have been
                    judged!</p>
                <p>The extant scholia on Euripides are for the nine select plays only. The first
                    edition of the scholia on seven of these plays (all but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troades</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhesus)</hi> was published by Arsenius—a
                    Cretan whom the Venetians had named as bishop of Monemvasia, but whom the Greeks
                    had refused to recognize—at Venice, in 1Ö34. The scholia on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Troades</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhesus</hi> were first
                    published by L. Dindorf, from Vat. 909, in 1821. The best complete edition is
                    that of W. Dindorf, in 4 vols., 1863. The collection, though loaded with
                    rubbish—including worthless analyses of the lyric metres by Demetrius
                    Triclinius—includes some invaluable comments derived from the Alexandrian
                    critics and their followers.</p>
