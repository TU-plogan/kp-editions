                    white spongy tissue of the mycelium of the fungus, termed originally by Léveillé
                    <hi rend="italic">Sphacelia</hi><hi rend="italic">segetum.</hi> From the
                    mycelium, at the expense of the substance of the ear, is developed the
                    sclerotium or ergot, the <hi rend="italic">Sclerotium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >clavus</hi> of De Candolle, and <hi rend="italic">Sρermceclia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">clavus</hi> of Fries. This, when placed on damp earth, produces
                    the third form of the fungus, its outer cell layers becoming soft, and filiform
                    spore-bearing stalks about an inch in length being thrown out. From the spores,
                    as also from the conidia of the mycelium stage, the mycelium may be again
                    produced.</p>
                <p>The drug consists of grains, usually curved (hence the name, from the Old French
                    <hi rend="italic">argot,</hi> a cock’s spur), which are violet-black or dark
                    purple externally, and whitish with a tinge of pink within, are between ∣ and 1
                    ⅛ in. long, and from 1 to 4 lines broad, and have two lateral furrows, a close
                    fracture, a disagreeable rancid taste, and a faint, fishy odour, which last
                    becomes more perceptible when the powder of the drug is mixed with potash
                    solution. Ergot should be kept in stoppered bottles in order to preserve it from
                    the attacks of a species of mite, and to prevent the oxidation of its fatty
                    oil.</p>
                <p>The oil of ergot, which constitutes 30 per cent, of its weight, appears to
                    consist mainly of palmitic acid, with some oleic acid. Among other constituents
                    the drug, according to Wenzell, contains two bitter alkaloids, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ergotin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eebolin,</hi> and to the latter the special
                    medicinal virtues of the drug are due. From the investigations, however, of
                    Prof. Dragendorff and Herr Padwissotzky, it appears that λVenzelΓs ergotin and
                    eebolin are not improbably identical with each other. By those chemists the
                    presence in ergot of the following compounds has been determined :— <hi
                    rend="italic">scleromucin,</hi> a slimy, colloidal body, soluble in water,
                    insoluble in alcohol; 2 to 3 per cent, of a tasteless and indorous principle,
                    <hi rend="italic">sclerotic acid,</hi> also colloidal, soluble in water and in
                    45 per cent, alcohol, and having, exclusive of a small quantity of ash, the
                    percentage composition—carbon 40, hydrogen, 5'2, nitrogen 4’2, oxygen 50'6;
                    minute quantities of slightly active colouring matters, <hi rend="italic"
                    >selererythrin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scleroiodin,</hi> with <hi
                    rend="italic">scleroknjstalliο, sclerοxanthin,</hi> and other substances. The
                    subcutaneous injection of from 0 02 to 0 04 gram, of sclerotic acid causes in
                    the frog a state of palsy, accompanied by a peculiar swelling, which lasts six
                    or seven days. (See <hi rend="italic">Pharm. Journ. and Trans.,</hi> June 17,
                    1876, p. 1001.) Trimethylamine, C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 9</hi> N, is said to be obtained from ergot by distillation
                    with potash, but neither that body nor ammonia pre-exists as such in the
                    drug.</p>
                <p>The extract, tincture, infusion, and powder of ergot are all employed in
                    medicine. What is commonly termed “ergotin” is an extract first prepared
                    byBonjean, of Chambéry, whose name it often bears. By age the active medicinal
                    properties of ergot are gradually impaired, and lost. The addition of 1 per
                    cent, of acetic acid is said to render the liquid preparations permanent. The
                    poisonous action of ergot on various animals has been shown by Bonjean, Diez,
                    Gross, Parola, Wright, and others. Thus Tessier found that in pigs it caused
                    first redness of the eyes and ears, then coldness of the limbs and swelling of
                    the joints, and finally gangrene of the extremities and intestines, and death
                    during convulsions. Among the symptoms of poisoning by ergot in man are nausea,
                    salivation, dilatation of the pupils, and subsequent injection of the
                    conjunctiva, some colic, occasionally diarrhoea, coldness of the skin, vertigo,
                    and convulsions. The name <hi rend="italic">ergotism</hi> has been applied to
                    the disease produced by the eating of food prepared from ergotized rye. It
                    appears to have been the cause of many of the epidemics which in former times
                    occurred in Europe, the last of these being thought to have been that which, at
                    the close of the rainy season of 1816, visited Lorraine and Burgundy. The
                    disease is usually fatal, and manifests itself in two phases, the spasmodic or
                    convulsive and the gangrenous. In the former the first experiences are
                    irritation of the skin, coldness of the body, cramps and numbness of the limbs,
                    and pains in the head and back, followed in from one to three weeks by
                    gastralgia, giddiness, fainting, convulsive movements of the muscles, and other
                    symptoms; frequently the skin becomes spotted with a vesicular eruption. Great
                    exhaustion and craving for food ensue. Examination of the body after death
                    reveals considerable inflammation of the abdominal viscera. Gangrenous ergotism
                    begins with weariness and pain of the limbs; the skin grows dull in hue, and at
                    length dry gangrene attacks the extremities, and when death does not supervene
                    the parts affected are generally lost. Dr E R. Squibb (<hi rend="italic">Year
                    Book of Pharmacy,</hi> 1874, p. 43) considers it probable that the poisoning
                    described as the result of eating ergotized food could occur only among underfed
                    semi-scorbutic people, or under conditions not present in cases ordinarily
                    requiring treatment with ergot. For the detection of the presence of ergot in
                    rye flour a small quantity of the sample is mixed with ether, and a few crystals
                    of oxalic acid are added; if the liquid after being boiled and allowed to grow
                    clear exhibits a red tinge, ergot is present in the sample (Böttger, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chem.</hi><hi rend="italic">Centralblatt,</hi> 3d ser., ii. 624).
                    Arnal, Beatty, Gibbon, and other experimenters have demonstrated that ergot
                    diminishes the frequency of the pulse. Its power of causing the contraction of
                    the unstriped muscular tissue of the body appears to be due principally to its
                    action on the sympathetic system of nerves. It has been maintained by Brown
                    Séquard that it occasions first vaso motor spasm, and secondly vaso-motor
                    paralysis. The powerful and persistent contraction of the uterus to which it
                    gives rise renders it valuable as a prophylactic against haemorrhage, and also,
                    according to some authorities, as a means of lessening the after-pains. Before
                    the completion of labour its use <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0541-0522"/> is contra-indicated when there are obstacles to
                    quick delivery; moreover, the drug may cause the rupture of the uterus, or
                    paralysis of the foetal heart by pressure, so that it should be excluded from
                    the available means of inducing labour, and ought not to be administered even so
                    late as two hours before the birth. From some cases that have been recorded, it
                    would appear that, even in large doses, the drug may have no effect as an
                    ecbolic if given in the early stages of gestation. Its influence on animals
                    during parturition is the same as that observed in the human female. Ergot has
                    been used generally as a styptic, and has been recommended in amenorrhoea
                    depending on torpidity of the uterus, in chronic dysentery, paraplegia,
                    paralysis of the bladder, paralysis produced by chronic myelitis, epilepsy,
                    whooping-cough, headache, and in obstinate intermittent fevers which are no
                    longer benefited. by quinine and arsenic. The hypodermic injection of .extract
                    of ergot was first employed for aneurisms by Prof. Langenbeck of Berlin in 1859;
                    and in 1872 Hildebrandt showed its applicability in cases of fibroid tumours of
                    the uterus; it has further been found a rapid and effectual remedy in
                    haemoptysis, enteric haemorrhage in typhoid, and in varix and bronchocele.
                    Unless injected in small quantity it is apt to produce much irritation of the
                    subcutaneous tissue.</p>
                <p>The earliest mention of ergot is said to occur in the writings of Sigebert de
                    Gremblour. The oxytoxic virtues of the drug, which are noticed by Lonicer, a
                    writer of the 16th century, seem to have been known in France and Germany from a
                    very remote period. It was not, however, until the year 1807 that, through Dr
                    Stearns, of Saratoga County, the importance of its properties was brought
                    prominently before the medical profession. The general recognition in Britain of
                    its value as a therapeutic agent dates from about the year 1828.</p>
