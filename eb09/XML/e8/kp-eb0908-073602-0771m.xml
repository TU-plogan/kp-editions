                    was the son of Rev. Oliver Everett, for some time a Congregational minister in
                    Boston, and afterwards judge of probate for Norfolk County. He graduated at
                    Harvard College, Cambridge, in 1806, taking the highest honours of his year,
                    though the youngest member of his class. He spent one year as a teacher in
                    Philip’s Academy, Exeter, and then began the study of law in the office of John
                    Quincy Adams, afterwards president of the United States. In 1809 Adams was
                    appointed minister to Russia, and Everett accompanied him as his private
                    secretary, remaining attached to the American legation in Russia until 1811. His
                    assiduity in the diplomatic career resulted in his promotion successively to the
                    position of secretary of legation and afterwards of charge d’affaires at the
                    Hague. He was subsequently minister to Spain, under the presidency of John
                    Quincy Adams. At that time Spain recognized none of the Governments established
                    by her revolted colonies, and Everett became the medium of all communications
                    between the Spanish Government and the several nations of Spanish origin which
                    had been established, by successful revolutions, on the other side of the ocean.
                    He died, May 29, 1847, at Hong Kong, whither he had been sent as commissioner of
                    the United States, before the present system of diplomatic intercourse with
                    China was inaugurated.</p>
                <p>Everett was not, however, so distinctly a diplomat as a man of letters, His long
                    residence in Europe, and his intimate acquaintance with the French, German,
                    Italian, and Spanish languages, resulted in wide and accurate acquaintance with
                    the literature of the Continental states. He studied their political system at
                    the same time, and in industrious and constant authorship published the results
                    of his observations on social systems and literature. His co-operation was
                    relied upon by the founders of the <hi rend="italic">North American Review,</hi>
                    the earliest American quarterly, and he was editor of that journal from the year
                    1829 to October 1835. In 1822 he published in London and in Boston <hi
                    rend="italic">A General Survey of Europe,</hi> which discusses the Continental
                    system and the balance of power as they were adjusted after the fall of
                    Napoleon. It attracted general attention, and was translated into German,
                    French, and Spanish. In 1825 he published in London and Boston <hi rend="italic"
                    >America,</hi> a somewhat similar description of the nations of North and South
                    America. This book also was translated into the principal European languages. In
                    1822 he published <hi rend="italic">New Ideas of Population,</hi> suggested by
                    Malthus’s works, and replying to that author by a wider exposition than Malthus
                    gave to the possibility of general and easy emigration. Some of his literary
                    papers from the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Democratic Review,</hi> and a volume of poems, have been published
                    in Boston. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nd</hi> American writer of his time was better
                    known on the continent of Europe.</p>
